That's literally why the creator of the game named it that. It was originally in the UK, but in the 60s it was imported to the United States as Clue.,No I mean the name was a play on words.,lmao i'm glad that this year's juniors got their caaspp cancelled,good for them,are you a junior in california?,oh wait nvm,the SAT 🤮,ugh i went to a high school of high-scoring asians so everything was bad,like if you didn't get a 1500 a lot of people felt embarassed,i know i did,lmao it's fine the sat doesn't mean shit 😂,my parents after spending $6000 on sat prep and seeing me not even get a 1500,i mean i was in the top 99% but NO,why is the sat so hard,and why is it geared towards smart people,i have no idea what the jee mains is,is that an indian thing,tea,remember the adversity score they wanted to add,My parents are Indian so I remember my dad talking about like PCM stuff.,my dad: become a computer scientist

me: -9 kg
teacher: bitch how's your mass negative,uh here are some tips,speak espanol,i'm a non-native,oh yeah use subjunctive,the graders have a boner for subjunctive,that's all i can say,Ugh the MC and writing saved me,if i only had speaking i would die,sksksk my cousin who lives nearby has their spanish exam soon too,i feel so sorry for him because he can write well but can't speak for shit,are you a sophomore? @Raven,so proud,look at him going places,mira a el yendo a lugares,i'm too lazy to accent,is that your only ap class,i mean this year,cool,i also took 1 then,ap world gang 😤,fuck those kids now who take ap world,back in my day we had to learn all the history from 3200 bc to the present,now they have to do 1200 - present,and bc of corona this year it's just 1200 - 1900,not to brag but back then i was smart,not now though 🤡,yep,make sure to remove any chrome extensions btw,also log in 30 minutes beforehand,yeah bc of the app,for world languages only,eww ap lit,don't read it unless you want to read 8 books that year,in my school it's 4 a year,but ap lit does 8,ap euro's boring,all those white people,and EVERYONE is named frederick or leopold,probs fake,Happy birthday!!! 🎂,does anyone have a link to a m*dded version of Originals,🙈,thank you king 😔"
373187896699781120,Maxroberts99#3809,"Hey guys,That’s a really hard one there’s so many good books,I’m going to get a lot of shit for this but I actually liked Sunkissed,Not my favorite book of all time but it was good,My favorite is probably OH,Lovehacks is pretty good,Ben is probably my favorite LI tbh,And I also really liked Sumire from PTR,What about you?,ES was awesome but I went with Quinn,I have a weakness for redheads lmao,Oh I also really liked Big Sky,Went with Juliette,Who did you go with in HSS?,Emma the first time around, then I played it again right before CA came out and went with Maria,Who did you guys choose as your LI in Class Act?,You're in grad school?,What are you going for?,Oh wow that's really cool! I'm still working on my undergrad,Thanks!,Undergrad definitely isn't like it is in Choices lmao,And romance,I have the expensive ass dorm room that's about it,The worst part is I'm paying all this money to be on campus for two in person classes a week,Gen eds suck,I just have two gen eds left. Math and science,Not looking forward to it,I haven't taken a math class in 4 years,I'm in my junior year and I've changed my major twice already and I still don't know what I want to do,Right now it's English,It is fun and I enjoy the creative writing part of it but all the literature classes we have to take are really hard,And I'm not sure what I'm going to be able to do with an English degree,I wrote a 10,000 word story just for fun,Actually I can't. The education track is a whole different thing and it'd be twice the work,Nah, not really my thing,I'm considering completely switching to hospitality and tourism,Yeah probably, but I think it'd be worth it,That's under the umbrella of a business degree so I could do a lot with it,Funny you say that, I am taking courses in German,Because the English major requires that you take a foreign language,And yeah Viv that is the flip side of it. I can't imagine spending 20+ years in the service industry,I really have no idea what I want to do,My issue is I don't even know what I should get a degree in,And it's already way past time to decide,I have a minor. Criminal justice. That's what I started out majoring in,I've considered law school,But I could never pass the LSAT,Yes,I don't know if I could do another 3 years of school,Plus it's expensive as fuck,The ultimate dream would be to write for a TV show, hence the English major,But the odds of getting into that are slim to none,And I'd have to live in LA which I would hate,Even cooler than that though would be to write for a video game but there's even fewer jobs there,I might just say fuck it and do the education track of the English degree,> yeah iirc riot games are hosting some internships this fall for college students that want to beef up their resume and some of their internships are in writing so if u want to u should definitely check that out
@Altair only problem with that is I don't play league lmao,I worked retail for a year,I feel like HR is even more paperwork than being a lawyer,It's all about who you know and what you've done,How’s everyone’s day been?,You’re 12 hours ahead of me,Yep!,I live in the south! Where is she studying?,I really hope Sienna becomes an LI,Who knows"

You know, once a user called Wetness trashy and some users got triggered cuz they like the book.,Weird liking....,Loll they surely do,Can't blame them. 
What do you hate the most about wetness?,Actually there is something good.,Diamonds we get at end of the chapter,I kind of feel bad that good outfits and hairstyles were wasted here.,> they're so beautiful but the MC wants to hook up on every square inch 🤡
