@azula sometimes yea,model reminds me of a mix of Moana and Mulan for whatever reason,lol that too,I have the game but never played it,lmao,MW did that and look at it,MW = no LI and focus on story = legendary,Spoilerland had an Among Us session?,oh,ahh,when u asked it was ard 1am so makes sense I didn't catch it,I've been looking for an excuse to touch Among Us,xD,thats why I don't play public matches,less fun,I remember seeing someone voting a person out just cuz they were pissed at them xD,lol,THREEP Bestest cat,ooop,I have the game but never played before,xd,REEE ok then,how do I do this?,I play on my phone,right,how do I select servers?,cuz I entered the code and says game not found @Deleted User,can someone help? pls,I feel like breaking down already.,@Deleted User,is the game country locked?,kk,my phone is ded @Deleted User,Yes,lmao,I'll be the 2nd one,either that or the one ur in Viv lmao,lmao,lmfao,I always copy math homework,from the student who always gets A,I always finish English the fastest cuz I'm smart boi,Math I always copy cuz I never pay attention in class,the ""I'll help you with it"" applies to accounting, business math and economics for me because sometimes I also teach these,I was a big nerd back then,we had homework was for subjects I had no attention for,> I was that nerd who never shared her hw
@Deleted User I was too but unfortunately my classmates are very persistent,we even had classmates from other classes asking to copy homework lmao,we had a whole network of homework copying,I'd do the ""bold to assume I did my hw"" depending on the situation,that applies to if I did it in advance,lol same,Lovestruck has some good LI's,and alot of CG,Lovestruck has a mod of infinite keys so u can binge but to grind for hearts (the premium currency) is a different story,MAN DS ending pissed me off big time,that was after reading the script for it,prices for premiums in Lovestruck cost abit more than your average Choices premium and they don't say exactly WHAT u get out of it, could be a steamy scene, could be a CG, u don't know which.,To get hearts u gotta read a specific LI's storyline for a specific amount of chapters the daily task asks for, after that u gain anywhere between 2-5 hearts,sometimes special dailies happen that can net u 10 to 15 but the number of chapters also increase from 10 to a whole season,> Facts. Schedule has been dry af lately. Decision making barely has any effect on the story anymore and the MCs usually have no say in the matter. God I miss 2018 Choices. Back when you could choose your MC’s gender and make decisions that actually had an impact on the story

So I decided to drop out of college even tho I'm 1 year away from graduating tho I still haven't officially dropped cuz I need to go to HR to do that, I haven't told my parents yet (I mean how can I even?) and I should feel good about it because it was one of my main issues for me being so depressed and stressed but tbh I just feel guilty and useless about it. It just feels petty to dropout when I'm just one year away but at the same time I don't feel happy at all ever since I started college, this was smth my parents wanted and not myself.,Now I'm just lost,IT and in the beginning I tried to make it work but it never really clicked with me and it just made me miserable,as of rn, not really. College was supposed to be smth that would help me find it but tbh I just feel more lost than ever,a gap year? probably tho I'd have to pay for it,umm wait nvm we don't have gap years here,if I do I'd have to redo the whole thing from Freshman year,I'm already on my 6th semester which is already specializations,I would probably take some time for myself first while finding some part-time jobs. As much as I wanna go full time immediately with the state I'm in I don't think it's wise,current classes?,it's online so not much else to say, I attend, tune it out to try and focus and not much. Sometimes when I'm having a slight anxiety attack for some classes I don't attend,my parents won't allow it. They are those types that don't believe in the superstition that is mental health and they think the only mental issue is autism. ||SO when I have issues they just call me autistic.||,I'm 21 so yea I am legal age I suppose,Tho last time I did that my Mom asked what we were talkin abt and she scolded me and said ||""unless you're an autistic person, u don't need any sort of help mentally.
