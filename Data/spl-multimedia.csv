@Hayley yeah i was actually quite surprised by that, very odd for a developer that prides themselves on inclusivity and definitely left a bad taste in my mouth... i tried introduction chapters of two books and my gripe is that all characters are written somewhat similar? so far, aside from little quirks and backstories, i can't see too much individuality between them, but I definitely need to pay more to actually form an opinion. Other than that, I really like the world building, the art style is gorgeous, the book premises are intriguing and I am enjoying the writing very much. I do hope that they won't stay in beta stage for much longer though since they don't have a fixed chapter release schedule yet and any opportunities to earn in-game currency outside of finishing chapters","","OOF (1)"

He said, 'Betiyaan maafi nahi maangti' (Daughters don't ask for forgiveness). I told him that he could've called me and scolded me.""[67] Later, Kumar said that though this incident was hurtful to him, he wishes to forgive, ignore, and move on, saying that he prefers to ""see Ram in everyone and ignore the Ravana.""[68]","",""

Deadpool is much hotter than Spider-Man, who by the way has zero sex appeal. The black and red combo of Deadpool’s attire creates a much more mature look when compared to Spider-Man’s blue and red. Additionally, Deadpool’s motif is much more alluring than a grown man cosplaying as a bug. Quite honestly I am clueless as to why Deadpool crushes on Spider-Man; objectively, it should be the other way around. Having Deadpool yearn for Spider-Man promotes the idea that those who are attractive must drop below their level and acquiesce to those who are inferior. It erodes the ability of attractive people to be independent and instead forces them to latch onto others, when in truth, it is better to be single than to follow someone not fit for you. After all, if one wants a limousine, they must stop asking Toyota drivers for advice.","",""

Sam was adopted by a family at three months old. As soon as he crossed the threshold, he started exploring and investigating every corner of his new home. That's how he found pencils, a headphone wire and several pairs of slippers.

He was surprised when the family screamed about wanting to throw him out of the house, but ultimately, they sent him to a dark, scary place, where he was locked in a cage.

When young Sam found himself among other abandoned dogs, he had no idea why he had been sent to such a terrible place.

A few days later, a joyful squeal woke Sam, and he found a strange man looking at him. This stranger named Brian took him to a warm house, fed him, and cared for him. Sam was afraid to explore this time, but his new owner took him in his arms and gave him a tour of his new home.

Sam has always remained grateful to the man who once saved his life. ”``","",""
