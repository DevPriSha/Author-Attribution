I just feel like it’s not good enough for *them* And that makes me hate it :gp_notlikethis: But then I feel like they’re just saying it’s good Or their standard isn’t the standard I should be meeting I don’t even know what standard I should be meeting Perhaps I’m trying too hard to copy the identity I once was Because people always praised it, said they loved it But I’ve grown and matured since those five years Yeah, I suppose so I also get anxious when writing about story characters because they might be too out of character I don’t even know what I want to write. I’m not into any fandoms nearly as much as I was back in those days How so? I used to write a lot of one-shots Short, unrelated stories of your crush falls in love with you- weeee I should sleep.

The MC is the daughter of an infamous ex-target who got taken out. She believes to this day that it wasn’t an accident but she can never prove otherwise. She has a lot of secret information that the agency needs and so they send the hitman over to get the information but it’s a type of gathering information that can’t be done over one night; it’ll take weeks or months. They end up falling in love after she is almost killed by another assassin who wanted her information. He then gets told that he has to kill her as the mission has been compromised. He doesn’t want to but it turns out he killed her father (*gasp*) and she sends him away, giving him more feelings to be able to kill her with instead. What happens next? :nicothinking: who knows Maybe I should write that :worry: It’s certainly something different, I feel Ew no If I write for Chapters with an idea like this then they get mega royalty income I’d probably have to end up selling all my rights But if you guys would be interested, I wouldn’t mind putting pen to paper in #writing-channel sometime Oh yeah, I forgot about that I just get too anxious about the ending :worry: I never did name that book Pri has it in her server and I’m in bed so I can’t post screenshots :aaaaaaaaaaah: I should really name that zombie book, uuuggghhh :nyoo: I’m about to throw darts Yeah, I’ll call it that I got it The Living Passes Over TLPO looks funny I’ll go with it I guess tomorrow I’ll finish TLPO and then I can write my hitman book Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy Nice It’s a dog surgery Big doggo has booboo knee That’s the premise :worry: I don’t recall adopting you but okay :quiggle: :yodayay: :shelleyscowl: :DogeLick: Why am I still awake My brainstorming session ended I’m weak Goodnight See :pkingShrug: They also have other Hindu gods like Agni, Bakasura, Ganesha, Kumbhakarna, Rama, Ravana and Vamana The only Hindu gods I played were Kali and Agni Didn’t particularly like the play styles of the others Interesting :nicothinking: But one is so tiny and one is so fat :nicoshocked: I wish I had that power... wow That’s a good insult for a Hindu So do you call someone hotheaded Agni? :nicothinking: Inteeesting I only know of the ones I listed :UmiYayCry: Don’t they all split into smaller gods? Because I know Kali is like the angry girl version of another goddess Her old design It also focused a lot more on her blood letting abilities before And now it’s more about her scythes and rage Ganesha is a cool dude He’s an elephant head Didn’t his head get chopped off before or something :nicothinking: Oh dang Sounds like Rheya That’s true Cool hearing it from a person that actually worships it Mythology is a really cool subject It’s all so different and vast I read some of it as a hobby, but nothing too massive Danke 👌 VIVA LA REVOLUTION :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :nicoshake: :HeyHeyHey: I feel like it’s my fault :gp_notlikethis: I started the joke :worry: @red hot silly pepper is your profile pic from Sakura Kiss Trick Ayeeeee My first yuri Good stuff :Salute: You get money for it So why not Snitches get money from the police department :quiggle: Also I don’t think beating someone up for what is most likely a warning is worth it :worry: Hey, England had nothing to do with that We had India, part of it But we were Protestant by that time > oh yeah england treated the scots and the irish like shit

As they should I knew he was a nob the moment I saw him Ayeeee Good lad :nicoheart: Throws are a bunch of nonces anyway Tories DUP are racist twats anyway And they’re Irish Can’t be trusted :worry: We have some of the highest death and infection rates in the world but don’t worry, primary schools are opening next week :MariSpooked: Yeah, open markets and car showrooms are opening next week too So infections will 100% spread even more. Dumbasses. I’ve not left the house since March, by the way :blobrave: Yep :gp_notlikethis: I have so many split ends but I’m not being a nonce and demanding a haircut Honestly, Tories are a nightmare Anyone who voted them deserves a big fat slap into a bin :salvatoTrash: I’ll call it the Connie bin because they’re Conservatives and conmen Racist bastards who voted to leave the EU Like really (One of my survey apps) This is an international app so it’s probably people who don’t actually understand the UK situation But you’re also not wrong in that case :KEKW: :worry: Oh dear Sounds like a bit of a prat then As I suggested, can we use the clothes version 👀 I changed vote Might be for some of the Asian and Aussie crew I have a fear of mild pain I get told to stop being a wuss when I’m scared to open a bottle of ketchup Okay so As a law student This is legal. If there is a protest and police have reasonable belief of a potential breach to the peace of the land then they are allowed to arrest people with reasonable force if they do not comply when being told to disperse Coronavirus is a really big thing in the UK still. If she was showing resistance to arrest then they are allowed to use reasonable force I can’t tell the full story from that video alone, it’s one-sided and missing information Am I anti-BLM? Of course not, but people do need to be informed of what is actually legal and what is the police abusing their powers by being racist Yes https://www.rmt.org.uk/member-benefits/resources/resources-for-reps/marches-assemblies-and-notice-of-protest/ A good start to the UK’s policy on protests is here S12 of the POA states that that video was within the law Yes It could be said that when she started seizuring they should have calmed down, but I don’t know if she actually did, if she showed restraint, there’s so many conditions that make it hard to say. We didn’t see that in the video so that’s not my call to make But everything else in the video was perfectly legal Oh no, the law is flawed in so many ways I certainly know that, some of the cases I research are messed up But it is important for people to know when the police are acting within the law or taking a racist approach Messed up as in the answer is right there but due to common law or strict statute or approaches taken by judges, it just won’t work And yes, if the girl tried to take the police to court, it would fall apart immediately It depends on what kind of law you study. I’ve done criminal law, public law, contract law, human rights, land law, several kinds of tort... you name it Some stuff is more interesting than others for sure, it can be quite depressing and it’s easy to see where things can be better but aren’t because of the old fashioned system Tort of negligence is quite interesting and some aspects of criminal law like theft, burglary, non-fatals and the like Police powers was a major part of my human rights course So I’m pretty familiar with what they legally can and can’t do Mostly with stop-and-search, powers of arrest and detainment and gatherings, warrants and the like Also power of entry, that too The issue in the video is with rights to protest, not Coronavirus social distancing The police may have reasonable belief that she is causing a breach to the peace of the land in another fashion The point I’m trying to make is that although it may seem wrong, these are just people trying to do their job, and they aren’t breaking the law in doing so. Please also try to understand it may also be the call of someone else, not necessarily them I don’t know how it is with the US, I don’t study their law, but that is the situation here. I’m not saying that we don’t have any prejudice police members, I have to look at statistics and it’s obvious there is unconscious (for the most part passive) racism It’s not perfect but it’s a good idea to try to open your perspectives a bit to the innocent police side too. Not all cops are bastards I understand what ACAB stands for but I think it’s wrong in its full principle Because there are police in those protests There are police helping the black people unjustly arrested And so ACAB is misguided Exactly What I hope is that this will at least help people to compromise on their mindset. I don’t aim to change your mind completely, that’s not my right, but I would like for you to understand that ACAB is partially flawed in what it stands for Jesus, the man’s insane I honestly find it hard to believe that’s legal Doesn’t surprise me, honestly Trump knows nothing about the law I think a big thing that differs US and UK protests is that UK protests have to be signed off in notice to a senior member of the local police force in advance and they will send the police to *aid* the protesters :nyoo: Y’all, I didn’t make memes for you to start criticising with your illiteracy :gp_notlikethis: ~~I was joking too~~ Oh right I think you guys may need medical help > abg ~~yeah I figured out what it means from UB~~ UB really is something I’m glad you guys like my cat meowing :yodayay: :yodaREE: :shelleyREE: Both my idiots Yeah :yodayay: :yodaREE: :yoda: :shelleyuwot: :shelleyscowl: :shelleyREE: :shelleyohno: :aaaaaaaaaaah: Yoda supports BLM :shelleyohno: is her falling off a table Which is why it looks so bad and I should delete it but I’m lazy Oh, you meant the heart :KEKW: Is it correct? No. Is it something that has to be done anyway? Yeah A lot of servers I’m in have made the compromise to talk about BLM and the positive side in general but make a separate optional channel for when to discuss rioting and harmful topics I’m not, I’m just giving a perspective Talk what you want How am I shutting it down by giving a *suggestion* to help compromise between those who want to talk about it and those who don’t want to see the violence I would hope not :worry: Oh okay Sorry :ashesweaty: I read enger as eager That’s my bad I guess that’s the point :nicothinking: I think he’s mostly concerned with the rioting aspect which may make him feel uncomfortable with mentions of violence I don’t think it’s unreasonable to request to not talk about the violent aspects of the riots. At the very least compromise by using spoiler tags (|| if anyone is unaware) Blue lives matter is a bit much All lives matter is one of those “there’s a time for it and that time isn’t now” kind of thing The one I heard was just because one house is on fire doesn’t mean you should have them hose down the while block just in case I don’t think it really needed to be on It wasn’t really anything aggressive apart from my misunderstanding at the start (sorry again :aaaaaaaaaaah: ) Ten seconds isn’t long enough for that though Good move Thank you for making a compromise It was kind of pathetically easy to see NSFW content before It may be part of some child development law, perhaps That way it’s on the child for legality reasons and not on Discord C-cup is still bad :UmiYayCry: :kekwhands: I often get a bit spotty and have stomach pains before mine comes on Would explain why I was sleeping horribly last night too My normal pills went on shortage so I’m having to take different ones They only work some of the time. This is my first one in two months but these pills do nothing for the pain I come back and I see incest, oh no :MonkaShh: Mostly that you’re sorry for their loss and that you’re there for them should they need anything I’ve never personally lost anyone so that may be a bit off but :monkaHmm: Yeah, wouldn’t recommend flowers At least from what I’ve seen, the best thing is a card Moonpig is a bit expensive sometimes. I’d also recommend Card Factory if you want a cheaper alternative It does https://www.cardfactory.co.uk It’s customisable too Got my Father’s Day card on there for £1.69, 99+80p delivery Probably will call me cheap but I don’t like paying for things more than they’re worth :worry: *cough* anyway, both are good FunkyPigeon is apparently still a thing That’s fair To me, I see my dad every day, and it’s a day he gets every year He’ll read the card once and never again So I won’t spend more than £2 on it :ChercheShrug: But for someone who doesn’t see their dad often, I can understand wanting to spend more for the significance Yikes Wish I could do that :KEKW: Then again, my parents don’t care about birthday cards And I’m glad they don’t because :worry: You’ve had 50+ of them Aren’t you tired by now I think my dad is 55, mum 52 My mum was 34 when she had me Guess that means my dad was 37 To be honest, having a child late is a lot better than a child at 17 Wow Imagine still doing the dillydo at 54 :nicoshocked: https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/gyfrgo/rchoices_we_need_to_have_a_discussion_on_pbs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf I don’t know if this is what you’re talking about but If it isn’t then could you give details in #choices-chat because if it’s something we could call boycott over then perhaps it should be shared I don’t think so :blobOwo: Me Nothing :ashesweaty: What kind of zombies are you going for?

I’m sure it’s just a minority of these communities but it’s definitely frustrating as an ally You feel like you aren’t doing enough and then get berated for it, you know? The pronouns they put there are just... a bit ridiculous from my point of view I just don’t understand what’s wrong with he/her and NB Why are they making it even more complicated...? How much more of an identity is there to make out of that? Of course I support it, that’s not an issue, but sometimes it really feels like it’s grasping at straws I can understand it when coming to sexuality Although even that has its limits sometimes But I can’t understand it at all when it comes to gender Same here When it gets more than that... it’s confusing and hard to keep up with I know I sound like the typical “whaaaa it’s too much and you should consider my feelings” sort of person But if you want people to actually follow and support your cause Don’t.. make it unnecessarily complicated It just ends up making people frustrated Like if you order a burger at a restaurant And you send it back one by one asking for more things And sometimes taking things out Add mayo, add cheese, remove the lettuce, add another patty, etc etc The chef is going to get really pissed at you And that’s how it feels at it constantly changing for no significant reason :ChercheShrug: That’s how it feels If you want a whole new burger because you have a sesame seed allergy and need a new burger bun Then I get it, no problem It’s a genuine development But otherwise come on, stop being pedantic I didn’t want to disregard anyone’s pronouns if it makes them happy It’s not like it hurts anyone But saying just because you’re not a part of the community so you shouldn’t have any input is a bit arrogant I think it’s also important to have opinions and views from the outside perspective Such as giving opinions as to what would help promote and normalise these sorts of things and what is going a little too far If you only hear from one perspective (AKA the people in these situations) then you’ll never learn how to properly promote yourself and not see some valuable things That goes for all things in life Shunning out people just because they don’t fit will severely hinder your growth That’s just my two cents. Listening to opinions from all sides is the best way to go about anything and considering with all of them the best way to process How so? It’s not so much as saying you shouldn’t use neopronouns. If it’s what makes you comfortable then I respect that But you should also understand that some people may not know that neopronoun so please don’t get mad at us if we get it wrong Some people do Unfortunately I did acknowledge that earlier What I’m trying to say is Don’t automatically assume people know these pronouns exist and please don’t get upset at us if we don’t immediately get it. We’re on your side and we’re trying to grow to support you, so please support us in trying to understand too It’s taken the world a long time to get used to even the idea of non-binary So all these fae, xe, sorts of things, it’s difficult sometimes So please just be patient and help us learn so we can support you My current understanding doesn’t go above the “traditional” gender terms right now and right now, these new terms coming out  can seem like it’s just something out of nowhere, especially if the differences are obvious And that’s why it’s important you help us to understand you It’s a partnership, I suppose If you’ve never heard them before and you’ve been used to he/she/NB for so long, that is how it can feel Remember that cishet people aren’t traditionally inside these groups to hear these developments But yeah, the whole point of this discussion is please help us to help you :ashesweaty: If someone wants to be addressed as fae/xe/the others then of course I would try because that’s what they’re comfortable with and it’s their identity. It’s important to them and I get it Gender reveal parties are so stupid So many accidents happen If you want to do the cake things, that’s cute. But massive balloons, alcohol, fireworks. Like come on I wouldn’t go to far as to raise my child “gender neutral” but I wouldn’t go about gender stereotyping Eh, cake is the least harmful of them if you want to compromise Because the media said so, unfortunately I studied gender developments and gender dysphoria (please correct me if that’s the outdated term, that’s what we used) and a lot of standards that we learn are from stereotypes established by the media Why not green Green is a fun colour In all eighteen years of my life, I’ve only worn make-up twice and it was for a drama play :monkaHmm: My parents tried to get me to like pink, princesses, dolls and all that Here I am playing Hitman and drowning people in toilets :worry: Just realised I’ve finished more Skyrim playthroughs in my lifetime than I have worn make-up :nyoo: I see the points from both sides when you separate sex and gender. Revealing the sex of the baby (through their *ahem* private parts) is fine but making people assume the gender is a bit farfetched Name reveal sounds more exciting than gender reveal Imagine going to Elon Musk’s naming reveal Now that would be fun I don’t think this discussion was really made to change anyone’s mind; more so to gain a broader perspective of how things are developing And you know, thank you for your thoughts on both topics, I appreciate them a lot and it has helped gain a wider understanding 👌 My question is why would that matter to anyone but you? I think it’s important that you allow your child to be who they wish My parents never stopped me from playing video games as a kid and that’s why I love them so much now And I’m happiest this way Biologically, I’m female. I was brought up with a lot of female gender roles but overall, my habits are what are stereotypically male I wouldn’t be happy wearing make-up and going shopping. It’s not me I don’t want to be a man, I just want to play video games :ashesweaty: :KEKW: I’m entering into a very male-dominated profession :ashesweaty: But that’s going into sexism roles which is a different thing altogether :HandsUp: No Jake I’m sure there’s a lot of people who also want that but are staying away to not spread the virus He’ll probably be re-elected, unfortunately People don’t care what a white man does :gp_whenfomortiisgetsatyou: I don’t think your parents would want that So don’t starve yourself for that It’s a dumb idea Yeah but in less of a potato quality You’re overrated :aaaaaaaaaaah: :MonkaShh: Time to get my alts to vote Jake Do you really think I could be bothered to make... *checks poll* 10+ alts to simply win a server poll? :monkapeek: You scared him I have a phobia of them :kekwhands: Ew, who sneezed on you Then it’s not TB TB is spread by droplets So Does anyone want to see what I spent my afternoon on :blobOwo: Too bad I got a detolf I use Brave :blobOwo: It’s like Chrome but less bearing on your CPU and has better encryption :worry: Corona doesn’t make you cough blood like that I also doubt it’s TB Perhaps you have a throat infection Try gargling salt water The best thing to do is to try to remove the bacteria from your throat I mean When you’ve been going on as long as the Simpsons have You’re going to find some coincidental overlap There’s only so much content you can have :ChercheShrug: He’s had that profile pic for months ? Oh no, I didn’t think that at all It’s just Doge has had that picture for months so it’s strange to see a request for it now I have no idea :ChercheShrug: :heartsob: :monkaHmm: What happened to Furi? He kind of died I was tempted to message him but I didn’t know if he had something going on or what We lost Kyo as a mod :kekwhands: He became co-admin No longer mod though :KEKW: Can I be mod :morishigasm: :aaaaaaaaaaah: I’m reporting you to admin for bully :gp_nobulli: Raeeeee :kananhug: I’m being boooolied :pepegun: Should I be happy that that photo isn’t loading for me :Monkas: Who do you have beef with Nothing Ye yikes Wh Maybe he should be dating her then https://twitter.com/sidhant/status/1277621639887286279?s=21 @YukkiMons do you have room in your house, I’m moving to India :kekwhands: China can take over a bit of the UK and I consider it a landslide victory on us if we ban Tik-Tok ^^ Stop copying each other and then going :KEKW: dumbass when people get confused :aaaaaaaaaaah: :aaaaaaaaaaah: :blobNobully: No, I am :blobOwo: Hm? Mashed potato Gravy Donuts Salami Cheese Ah crap I did a repeat :gp_notlikethis: :nicothinking: Everyone knows who I am since I haven’t changed my @ or my picture Nice :monkapeek: Priyudi :nicothinking: That’s what I wanted :worry: What about everyone else @Water Puppies Just play Skyrim for the ten thousandth time like a normal person Then get the Steam version https://twitter.com/maralinasakura/status/1279145938607628288?s=21 Also vote in my 100% non-biased poll Then you fight for Ulfric Stormcloak You’re entitled to your wrong opinion, I suppose ~~I’m memeing, please no hate :blobNobully: ~~ I don’t agree at all with the segregation in Windhelm but I’m certain that that was a thing before he was jarl Ulfric wanted what was best for Skyrim and the Imperials want what is best for the Empire Even if that’s at the expense of Skyrim So I had a read because I didn’t want to be ignorant about it A lot of it seems to be about “he said-she said” 1. A lot of people say that he won’t send aid to non-Nords or the Grey Quarter because he’s racist. He says that he’s too busy with the war which in kind of understandable to a degree but he does make the guards help the best they can

2. There’s differing opinions about the segregation of the Grey Quarter. Some say he put them there out of racism and segregation. There’s NPCs that claim differently (see pic). I think there’s sides to both here but naming it the Grey Quarter after their skin is a little sus. He does allow non-Nords, like Altmer and Imperials to live in Windhelm though. 

So I think there are elements of racism but I don’t think it’s nearly as extremist as it is told. It’s war propaganda at the end of the day so there will always be elements of hyperbole and undermining I know this should be in #multimedia-shabang but :kekwhands: :worry: Clearly I didn’t play this game as much as I thought Well, you showed me Thanks for the info, appreciate it genuinely Uh Can you not act like an ass please? You don’t need to act like that when I wasn’t like that with you. What? Ah Like, I’m not offended by being wrong, I’m happy to learn more about a plot line that I haven’t seen in like 2+ years But there’s no reason to be like that. I never supported Ulfric’s racist acts to begin with and I genuinely thought they were a lot less than they actually are Okay; thank you :ashesweaty: I’m not that great with that sort of sarcasm sometimes. Kind of triggers some unpleasant memories but you couldn’t know that so sorry if I react a bit too much :ashesweaty: Thank you :nicoheart: Appreciate it Second wave is coming bois UK is just filled with absolute pissheads who think Corona is some sort of game Mexico is going to collapse Long story short: the president is trying to turn the country into North Korea And also their attitude to Corona is “if we don’t test people then we have no cases” I was looking at the cases and the UK probably actually has cases proportionate to the population but it looks like we have loads more because we’re actually testing people Actually no We probably have far more than proportionate to the population because Boris is useless but we have a lot more than other countries by a fair bit because we test more You mean “cured”? We do on Twitter, let me see https://twitter.com/dhscgovuk/status/1279074484750876676?s=21 This is the only thing they give So we have no official number but I guess you can do an estimate by the death and total count Yeah, we test a lot of people But My dad had a heart attack earlier this year and he got tested He came back “inconclusive” :ChercheShrug: Thanks, he’s fine now, it was really minor thankfully Corona is horrible after you “recover” still Your lungs are permanently damaged and I think some even get scarring Just because you’re no longer infected doesn’t mean you’re not significantly weakened And I think that’s something a lot of people don’t realise If my dad did have it, he got it very mildly But we’ll never know He does have to go have an X-Ray soon though Why doesn’t China just stop eating bloody bats Swine flu Swine flu is a type of flu It’s not a singular entity It’s come back with a new strain Corona is raccoon :gp_skeyes: Uh huh And said plague can be cured with antibiotics Please be careful not to fear monger It’s hard to read tone on the internet, you should be careful :worry: Remember when TC&TF was releasing :aaaaaaaaaaah: Mine was The Freshman because they just dropped you in it I haven’t read/written anything in Wattpad in years It was good back in time but I really can’t read anything with bad grammar which is, unfortunately, the majority > Some videos are funny tbh

All I know is Callum Oh my god And Dodge the dog Some do, some don’t. I think a lot of the UK nowadays are anti-monarchy but we can’t do anything about it I personally don’t, neither does my family. Some people are obsessed with Megan and Kate “One of them” means Harry and Megan They’re no longer allowed to get money from the royal family or use their titles Uhmmmmm I think most people don’t like her because she’s American, not because she’s POC Marry who you want, I personally don’t care. It’s not my business I’d support you The only member of the royal family I like is the Queen because she has so many good memes. She earnt her right in that regard. Charles is useless, William is the most boring man alive and Harry is a prat You can’t say that He’s ginger Trash It comes out for me later because I don’t have a key :KEKW: :kekwhands: When will TRR series die Christ, Viv. Take care of yourself and your family You do whatever it takes to help you relax and recover. I’m sure the other staff can handle our rambling. :nicoheart: The hell is that ,im Capri-Sun UK I love the lack of an image ,im Caprisun UK bOT It looks like this in the UK It’s even hyphenated If I could ban two things in the world I would choose TikTok and Fortnite Also I would ban non-medically caused obese people to have financial benefits Yes If you eat enough and become medically diagnosed as obese to the point you can’t work, you can claim benefits And believe me, people genuine do this to get out of work. That Simpsons episode wasn’t overplayed Yes Fortnite Because TikTok enables ||pedophiles|| and Fortnite is filled with toxic twelve year olds Unfortunately, we do So if I ever get into power (I don’t know why but sure), I’m abolishing that benefit Unless it’s caused by medical issues, you’re not allowed Don’t be a fat piece of crap Which part Ah yeah It is pretty difficult. You’d have to get a private members bill through to change whatever piece of legislation it comes under And PMBs are a nightmare https://youtu.be/TpHOaJsxgRE Then how about you go educate yourself, Hyper Just think about it This is a video-sharing app with a 13+ rating with common “challenges” for children to do weird dances It also has a very easy messaging system True, but TikTok is the worst offender of them all as it’s actual videos It can be but TikTok’s whole thing is to create silly videos Instagram is whatever you like And what 2-D said Of course not I’m not saying they are because of course they aren’t. But TikTok is definitely the main offender right now, and then Snapchat Problem is is that Snapchat you have to add people and your photos and videos are temporary. People also know when you’ve taken screenshots or videos TikTok is like an even more exposure culture than YouTube I don’t use Snapchat because the Snapmaps thing gives me anxiety (yes I know you can disable it) Anyway, yeah, while all social media can be used by ||pedophiles||, it’s definitely TikTok which is the main offender because of the “trends/challenges” and the full body video format which appeals to young children Mhm I mean that too I stopped playing mostly ||pedophile||? Alright, I’ll do it now ~~that should be all of them, let me know if I missed one~~ His eyes Do not change That’s really creepy from a psychological standpoint Eh, Mark can sell my data all he wants.

I just know I get quite deep when I read texts, especially Shakespearean :KEKW: Excuse my theatrical reading, I did drama for my old exams I don’t know who Keira Knightley is Oh her :nicothinking: I’m posh southern I have an iPhone 11 so it picks up sound well I’d damn hope it’s at least decent considering this phone is £799 I’m not turning the fan off You can’t make me :worry: I just breathed heavily down the phone, said nothing and then hung up and I never got a call again I’m deaf and I just pretend I understood and laugh :) I’m not actually deaf I probably am a bit hard of hearing :worry: Bit of a minger It is pretty intimidating I wouldn’t like it It just feels a bit too much A lot of people don’t like @s Hey so uhh, I’m writing a polyamorous relationship into my novel and I was wondering if there were any polyamorous people here that could give me a sort of framework as to how it works?

Neither Heck yes I’d worship you anyway Well, Asia is usually praised a lot for its work and production, plus they are famed a lot for beauty :nicothinking: Whereas blacks, a lot of people still see them as slaves or idiots :worry: What the heck is I and A We stan our corona queen What was wrong with LGBT+ Why is it getting ridiculously long Do you mean demand as a negative Because LGBTQIA sounds stupidly overdone There was nothing wrong with LGBT+ I’m all for these rights but when they keep adding more letters, it gets tiring to remember and then people start correcting you. And it’s frustrating when there was *already* an accepted role Also I thought the Q addition was supposed to be the inclusive one?? Viv takes me and I’m not even a lesbian :UmiSlain: Poosy Like, recently had a conversation maybe a month or two ago about the “new” gender terms.

And thanks for the shoutout! I’ve not changed my picture in over two years so I think I’m good? I don’t know if I’ve ever used Umi as my Discord picture :nicothinking: Maybe once for a bit But I can only think of two pictures I’ve had which is this one and another card from SIF of one of the background characters I’d love to use fan art of Umi because there’s some gorgeous pieces but it’s often really difficult to contact artists for permission They’re blaming us if we start anything :ChercheShrug: Oh, really?? I know that you should always ask Japanese artists because they could get DMCAs or legal trouble because of copyright That’s what I’ve heard anyway.

Yayyy :nicoshake: Eh I hate all the royals apart from Elizabeth I’m pretty anti-Harry and Meghan because of the mess they’ve made They’ve tried to not have royal duties but still be royals and be paid for it > I only ask this question out of curiosity, is there a historical precedent for this, could they have found a way to not have royal duties and not be royals and get paid for it?
No, there’s no previous precedent that I’m aware of because publicity in history was the king and that’s it If you weren’t the heir, you were the spare. If you’re a woman, nobody cares about you Everything They’ve made everything a joke And there’s so many conspiracy theories that Meghan will be the next Diana Race is a part of it Not for me because I’m not a bloody racist I just hate everyone but Elizabeth Oh yeah How do I get rid of that It doesn’t say how to get rid of it though Oh wait :KEKW: There we go :nicoshake: I’m no longer Drewified :kekwhands: Sure, boo :LysitheaSmug: Honey, where is my supersuit?!

Yes :KEKW: I’m “lol nope” most of the time Sometimes read What’s up :nicothinking: I suppose there are “slightly gay” versions of normal accents, yeah Like, you can hear someone from Liverpool and you’d know if they were gay or not London has a fair few different accents He has a drag queen accent He’s probably a northerner that moved to London Because he sounds Liverpool or slightly north than that Alan Carr is from Dorset Which is like extreme south of England Liverpool is the worst English accent By far It’s common class accent, hard to understand, bad colloquialism and just sounds horrible I don’t think the term cockney is used anymore Southern but middle class Yeah Because I was born/grew up in what would be considered heavily working class Because I’m middle class, my parents beat out of me basically all slang and dropping of any letters, which is considered very common in working class So I would never say stuff like innit or ain’t Nor would I ever drop my t’s or h’s Northern Ain’t isn’t a real word but it ended up becoming common place in the working class chavs As a slang term Yes I can’t stand the word ain’t It’s horrible Would be an idea In most areas where it matters, it’s very frowned upon to use that word Cuck Flint He’s so freaking freaky Like Jesus Christ Let me breathe before you go mIsS sAkUrA Did I ask mate no o didn’t Nope Not on SPL2 anymore :aaaaaaaaaaah: Miles is far better than Clint because he at least respects our boundaries and doesn’t get us freaking pregnant I’ll maybe read the first chapter just to see But like, mental health is not good right now :KEKW: Thank you:ashesweaty: :nicoheart: Nobody *has* to do it Maybe it would be best if nobody did Kyo is mum instead Who stole his ears :monkapeek: Viv the ear stealer Why does that sound like something John Oliver said My god I saw that :KEKW: It was hilarious Vivo la Vida loca :KEKW: :froggiedance: It’s $5 :monkaChrist: Be like Drew Pay $5 a month to give people seizures Or pay $15 a month to read Ms. Forced Sex.

So like the main two are Conservatives (currently in power under Boris Johnson) and the Opposition which is currently Labour (under Keir Starmir). Anyway, there’s a bunch of smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Green Party, DUP, Plaid Cymru, etc but nobody cares about them anymore Probably spelt Keir’s surname wrong but he’s a nonce and he can kindly fuck off Liberal Party is just the Liberal Democrats (LibDems) :Yousoro: It’s true, I’m gay for Viv British people aren’t polite; we’re just too socially awkward I can think Viv’s a total knobjockey but I’m too awkward to say it to her Because what if she thinks poorly of me And that’s how Brits function :KEKW: Viv, are you bi or lesbian I forget feck Yeah, I thought so But damn :EdelSweat: I need a moment after that How does everyone in the world not have a crush on Viv I thought you said “I went to Manchester” as a way of saying that’s why people don’t have a crush on you And honestly, knowing what Manchester is like, fair @Tyr Hi boo Yep, definitely Manchester :KEKW: One of my best online friends is from Yorkshire and his accent cracks me up No? :KEKW: Ah yeah, Liella Meme Keke Thanks, phone I have no clue We don’t know too much about the character creation of the LL girls Sounds musty His breath be like a car exhaust :hawyee: He better not cough up phlegm on me Can I just say ||I threw-up a few weeks ago for the first time in like a decade and it was like weirdly freeing??
