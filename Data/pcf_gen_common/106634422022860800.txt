The MC is the daughter of an infamous ex-target who got taken out. She believes to this day that it wasnt an accident but she can never prove otherwise. She has a lot of secret information that the agency needs and so they send the hitman over to get the information but its a type of gathering information that cant be done over one night; itll take weeks or months. They end up falling in love after she is almost killed by another assassin who wanted her information. He then gets told that he has to kill her as the mission has been compromised. He doesnt want to but it turns out he killed her father (*gasp*) and she sends him away, giving him more feelings to be able to kill her with instead. What happens next? :nicothinking: who knows Maybe I should write that :worry: Its certainly something different, I feel Ew no If I write for Chapters with an idea like this then they get mega royalty income Id probably have to end up selling all my rights But if you guys would be interested, I wouldnt mind putting pen to paper in #writing-channel sometime Oh yeah, I forgot about that I just get too anxious about the ending :worry: I never did name that book Pri has it in her server and Im in bed so I cant post screenshots :aaaaaaaaaaah: I should really name that zombie book, uuuggghhh :nyoo: Im about to throw darts Yeah, Ill call it that I got it The Living Passes Over TLPO looks funny Ill go with it I guess tomorrow Ill finish TLPO and then I can write my hitman book Tibial Plateau Leveling Osteotomy Nice Its a dog surgery Big doggo has booboo knee Thats the premise :worry: I dont recall adopting you but okay :quiggle: :yodayay: :shelleyscowl: :DogeLick: Why am I still awake My brainstorming session ended Im weak Goodnight See :pkingShrug: They also have other Hindu gods like Agni, Bakasura, Ganesha, Kumbhakarna, Rama, Ravana and Vamana The only Hindu gods I played were Kali and Agni Didnt particularly like the play styles of the others Interesting :nicothinking: But one is so tiny and one is so fat :nicoshocked: I wish I had that power... wow Thats a good insult for a Hindu So do you call someone hotheaded Agni? :nicothinking: Inteeesting I only know of the ones I listed :UmiYayCry: Dont they all split into smaller gods?

As they should I knew he was a nob the moment I saw him Ayeeee Good lad :nicoheart: Throws are a bunch of nonces anyway Tories DUP are racist twats anyway And theyre Irish Cant be trusted :worry: We have some of the highest death and infection rates in the world but dont worry, primary schools are opening next week :MariSpooked: Yeah, open markets and car showrooms are opening next week too So infections will 100% spread even more. Dumbasses. Ive not left the house since March, by the way :blobrave: Yep :gp_notlikethis: I have so many split ends but Im not being a nonce and demanding a haircut Honestly, Tories are a nightmare Anyone who voted them deserves a big fat slap into a bin :salvatoTrash: Ill call it the Connie bin because theyre Conservatives and conmen Racist bastards who voted to leave the EU Like really (One of my survey apps) This is an international app so its probably people who dont actually understand the UK situation But youre also not wrong in that case :KEKW: :worry: Oh dear Sounds like a bit of a prat then As I suggested, can we use the clothes version  I changed vote Might be for some of the Asian and Aussie crew I have a fear of mild pain I get told to stop being a wuss when Im scared to open a bottle of ketchup Okay so As a law student This is legal. If there is a protest and police have reasonable belief of a potential breach to the peace of the land then they are allowed to arrest people with reasonable force if they do not comply when being told to disperse Coronavirus is a really big thing in the UK still. If she was showing resistance to arrest then they are allowed to use reasonable force I cant tell the full story from that video alone, its one-sided and missing information Am I anti-BLM? Of course not, but people do need to be informed of what is actually legal and what is the police abusing their powers by being racist Yes https://www.rmt.org.uk/member-benefits/resources/resources-for-reps/marches-assemblies-and-notice-of-protest/ A good start to the UKs policy on protests is here S12 of the POA states that that video was within the law Yes It could be said that when she started seizuring they should have calmed down, but I dont know if she actually did, if she showed restraint, theres so many conditions that make it hard to say. We didnt see that in the video so thats not my call to make But everything else in the video was perfectly legal Oh no, the law is flawed in so many ways I certainly know that, some of the cases I research are messed up But it is important for people to know when the police are acting within the law or taking a racist approach Messed up as in the answer is right there but due to common law or strict statute or approaches taken by judges, it just wont work And yes, if the girl tried to take the police to court, it would fall apart immediately It depends on what kind of law you study. Ive done criminal law, public law, contract law, human rights, land law, several kinds of tort... you name it Some stuff is more interesting than others for sure, it can be quite depressing and its easy to see where things can be better but arent because of the old fashioned system Tort of negligence is quite interesting and some aspects of criminal law like theft, burglary, non-fatals and the like Police powers was a major part of my human rights course So Im pretty familiar with what they legally can and cant do Mostly with stop-and-search, powers of arrest and detainment and gatherings, warrants and the like Also power of entry, that too The issue in the video is with rights to protest, not Coronavirus social distancing The police may have reasonable belief that she is causing a breach to the peace of the land in another fashion The point Im trying to make is that although it may seem wrong, these are just people trying to do their job, and they arent breaking the law in doing so. Please also try to understand it may also be the call of someone else, not necessarily them I dont know how it is with the US, I dont study their law, but that is the situation here. Im not saying that we dont have any prejudice police members, I have to look at statistics and its obvious there is unconscious (for the most part passive) racism Its not perfect but its a good idea to try to open your perspectives a bit to the innocent police side too. Not all cops are bastards I understand what ACAB stands for but I think its wrong in its full principle Because there are police in those protests There are police helping the black people unjustly arrested And so ACAB is misguided Exactly What I hope is that this will at least help people to compromise on their mindset. I dont aim to change your mind completely, thats not my right, but I would like for you to understand that ACAB is partially flawed in what it stands for Jesus, the mans insane I honestly find it hard to believe thats legal Doesnt surprise me, honestly Trump knows nothing about the law I think a big thing that differs US and UK protests is that UK protests have to be signed off in notice to a senior member of the local police force in advance and they will send the police to *aid* the protesters :nyoo: Yall, I didnt make memes for you to start criticising with your illiteracy :gp_notlikethis: ~~I was joking too~~ Oh right I think you guys may need medical help > abg ~~yeah I figured out what it means from UB~~ UB really is something Im glad you guys like my cat meowing :yodayay: :yodaREE: :shelleyREE: Both my idiots Yeah :yodayay: :yodaREE: :yoda: :shelleyuwot: :shelleyscowl: :shelleyREE: :shelleyohno: :aaaaaaaaaaah: Yoda supports BLM :shelleyohno: is her falling off a table Which is why it looks so bad and I should delete it but Im lazy Oh, you meant the heart :KEKW: Is it correct? No. Is it something that has to be done anyway? Yeah A lot of servers Im in have made the compromise to talk about BLM and the positive side in general but make a separate optional channel for when to discuss rioting and harmful topics Im not, Im just giving a perspective Talk what you want How am I shutting it down by giving a *suggestion* to help compromise between those who want to talk about it and those who dont want to see the violence I would hope not :worry: Oh okay Sorry :ashesweaty: I read enger as eager Thats my bad I guess thats the point :nicothinking: I think hes mostly concerned with the rioting aspect which may make him feel uncomfortable with mentions of violence I dont think its unreasonable to request to not talk about the violent aspects of the riots. At the very least compromise by using spoiler tags (|| if anyone is unaware) Blue lives matter is a bit much All lives matter is one of those theres a time for it and that time isnt now kind of thing The one I heard was just because one house is on fire doesnt mean you should have them hose down the while block just in case I dont think it really needed to be on It wasnt really anything aggressive apart from my misunderstanding at the start (sorry again :aaaaaaaaaaah: ) Ten seconds isnt long enough for that though Good move Thank you for making a compromise It was kind of pathetically easy to see NSFW content before It may be part of some child development law, perhaps That way its on the child for legality reasons and not on Discord C-cup is still bad :UmiYayCry: :kekwhands: I often get a bit spotty and have stomach pains before mine comes on Would explain why I was sleeping horribly last night too My normal pills went on shortage so Im having to take different ones They only work some of the time. This is my first one in two months but these pills do nothing for the pain I come back and I see incest, oh no :MonkaShh: Mostly that youre sorry for their loss and that youre there for them should they need anything Ive never personally lost anyone so that may be a bit off but :monkaHmm: Yeah, wouldnt recommend flowers At least from what Ive seen, the best thing is a card Moonpig is a bit expensive sometimes. Id also recommend Card Factory if you want a cheaper alternative It does https://www.cardfactory.co.uk Its customisable too Got my Fathers Day card on there for 1.69, 99+80p delivery Probably will call me cheap but I dont like paying for things more than theyre worth :worry: *cough* anyway, both are good FunkyPigeon is apparently still a thing Thats fair To me, I see my dad every day, and its a day he gets every year Hell read the card once and never again So I wont spend more than 2 on it :ChercheShrug: But for someone who doesnt see their dad often, I can understand wanting to spend more for the significance Yikes Wish I could do that :KEKW: Then again, my parents dont care about birthday cards And Im glad they dont because :worry: Youve had 50+ of them Arent you tired by now I think my dad is 55, mum 52 My mum was 34 when she had me Guess that means my dad was 37 To be honest, having a child late is a lot better than a child at 17 Wow Imagine still doing the dillydo at 54 :nicoshocked: https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/gyfrgo/rchoices_we_need_to_have_a_discussion_on_pbs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf I dont know if this is what youre talking about but If it isnt then could you give details in #choices-chat because if its something we could call boycott over then perhaps it should be shared I dont think so :blobOwo: Me Nothing :ashesweaty: What kind of zombies are you going for?

You are now holding the holder of the holding inside the holding that holds :quiggle: I know this server is pretty LGBT+ friendly so has anyone actually heard any of these before Because Ive never heard any of these before actually used. They sound like fantasy roles.. I figured that would be the general consensus:nicothinking: I can see Xe/xem replacing them but Since when was them not gender neutral Fae is literally a magical creature I dont want to be rude/insensitive but like Why are you changing things that already meet your aims..? Unless my cishet(is that the term) privilege is showing Its like every week theres a new term And then the same people get mad when you cant keep up.. Im sure its just a minority of these communities but its definitely frustrating as an ally You feel like you arent doing enough and then get berated for it, you know? The pronouns they put there are just... a bit ridiculous from my point of view I just dont understand whats wrong with he/her and NB Why are they making it even more complicated...? How much more of an identity is there to make out of that? Of course I support it, thats not an issue, but sometimes it really feels like its grasping at straws I can understand it when coming to sexuality Although even that has its limits sometimes But I cant understand it at all when it comes to gender Same here When it gets more than that... its confusing and hard to keep up with I know I sound like the typical whaaaa its too much and you should consider my feelings sort of person But if you want people to actually follow and support your cause Dont.. make it unnecessarily complicated It just ends up making people frustrated Like if you order a burger at a restaurant And you send it back one by one asking for more things And sometimes taking things out Add mayo, add cheese, remove the lettuce, add another patty, etc etc The chef is going to get really pissed at you And thats how it feels at it constantly changing for no significant reason :ChercheShrug: Thats how it feels If you want a whole new burger because you have a sesame seed allergy and need a new burger bun Then I get it, no problem Its a genuine development But otherwise come on, stop being pedantic I didnt want to disregard anyones pronouns if it makes them happy Its not like it hurts anyone But saying just because youre not a part of the community so you shouldnt have any input is a bit arrogant I think its also important to have opinions and views from the outside perspective Such as giving opinions as to what would help promote and normalise these sorts of things and what is going a little too far If you only hear from one perspective (AKA the people in these situations) then youll never learn how to properly promote yourself and not see some valuable things That goes for all things in life Shunning out people just because they dont fit will severely hinder your growth Thats just my two cents. Listening to opinions from all sides is the best way to go about anything and considering with all of them the best way to process How so? Its not so much as saying you shouldnt use neopronouns. If its what makes you comfortable then I respect that But you should also understand that some people may not know that neopronoun so please dont get mad at us if we get it wrong Some people do Unfortunately I did acknowledge that earlier What Im trying to say is Dont automatically assume people know these pronouns exist and please dont get upset at us if we dont immediately get it. Were on your side and were trying to grow to support you, so please support us in trying to understand too Its taken the world a long time to get used to even the idea of non-binary So all these fae, xe, sorts of things, its difficult sometimes So please just be patient and help us learn so we can support you My current understanding doesnt go above the traditional gender terms right now and right now, these new terms coming out  can seem like its just something out of nowhere, especially if the differences are obvious And thats why its important you help us to understand you Its a partnership, I suppose If youve never heard them before and youve been used to he/she/NB for so long, that is how it can feel Remember that cishet people arent traditionally inside these groups to hear these developments But yeah, the whole point of this discussion is please help us to help you :ashesweaty: If someone wants to be addressed as fae/xe/the others then of course I would try because thats what theyre comfortable with and its their identity. Its important to them and I get it Gender reveal parties are so stupid So many accidents happen If you want to do the cake things, thats cute. But massive balloons, alcohol, fireworks. Like come on I wouldnt go to far as to raise my child gender neutral but I wouldnt go about gender stereotyping Eh, cake is the least harmful of them if you want to compromise Because the media said so, unfortunately I studied gender developments and gender dysphoria (please correct me if thats the outdated term, thats what we used) and a lot of standards that we learn are from stereotypes established by the media Why not green Green is a fun colour In all eighteen years of my life, Ive only worn make-up twice and it was for a drama play :monkaHmm: My parents tried to get me to like pink, princesses, dolls and all that Here I am playing Hitman and drowning people in toilets :worry: Just realised Ive finished more Skyrim playthroughs in my lifetime than I have worn make-up :nyoo: I see the points from both sides when you separate sex and gender. Revealing the sex of the baby (through their *ahem* private parts) is fine but making people assume the gender is a bit farfetched Name reveal sounds more exciting than gender reveal Imagine going to Elon Musks naming reveal Now that would be fun I dont think this discussion was really made to change anyones mind; more so to gain a broader perspective of how things are developing And you know, thank you for your thoughts on both topics, I appreciate them a lot and it has helped gain a wider understanding  My question is why would that matter to anyone but you? I think its important that you allow your child to be who they wish My parents never stopped me from playing video games as a kid and thats why I love them so much now And Im happiest this way Biologically, Im female. I was brought up with a lot of female gender roles but overall, my habits are what are stereotypically male I wouldnt be happy wearing make-up and going shopping. Its not me I dont want to be a man, I just want to play video games :ashesweaty: :KEKW: Im entering into a very male-dominated profession :ashesweaty: But thats going into sexism roles which is a different thing altogether :HandsUp: No Jake Im sure theres a lot of people who also want that but are staying away to not spread the virus Hell probably be re-elected, unfortunately People dont care what a white man does :gp_whenfomortiisgetsatyou: I dont think your parents would want that So dont starve yourself for that Its a dumb idea Yeah but in less of a potato quality Youre overrated :aaaaaaaaaaah: :MonkaShh: Time to get my alts to vote Jake Do you really think I could be bothered to make... *checks poll* 10+ alts to simply win a server poll? :monkapeek: You scared him I have a phobia of them :kekwhands: Ew, who sneezed on you Then its not TB TB is spread by droplets So Does anyone want to see what I spent my afternoon on :blobOwo: Too bad I got a detolf I use Brave :blobOwo: Its like Chrome but less bearing on your CPU and has better encryption :worry: Corona doesnt make you cough blood like that I also doubt its TB Perhaps you have a throat infection Try gargling salt water The best thing to do is to try to remove the bacteria from your throat I mean When youve been going on as long as the Simpsons have Youre going to find some coincidental overlap Theres only so much content you can have :ChercheShrug: Hes had that profile pic for months ? Oh no, I didnt think that at all Its just Doge has had that picture for months so its strange to see a request for it now I have no idea :ChercheShrug: :heartsob: :monkaHmm: What happened to Furi? He kind of died I was tempted to message him but I didnt know if he had something going on or what We lost Kyo as a mod :kekwhands: He became co-admin No longer mod though :KEKW: Can I be mod :morishigasm: :aaaaaaaaaaah: Im reporting you to admin for bully :gp_nobulli: Raeeeee :kananhug: Im being boooolied :pepegun: Should I be happy that that photo isnt loading for me :Monkas: Who do you have beef with Nothing Ye yikes Wh Maybe he should be dating her then https://twitter.com/sidhant/status/1277621639887286279?s=21 @YukkiMons do you have room in your house, Im moving to India :kekwhands: China can take over a bit of the UK and I consider it a landslide victory on us if we ban Tik-Tok ^^ Stop copying each other and then going :KEKW: dumbass when people get confused :aaaaaaaaaaah: :aaaaaaaaaaah: :blobNobully: No, I am :blobOwo: Hm? Mashed potato Gravy Donuts Salami Cheese Ah crap I did a repeat :gp_notlikethis: :nicothinking: Everyone knows who I am since I havent changed my @ or my picture Nice :monkapeek: Priyudi :nicothinking: Thats what I wanted :worry: What about everyone else @Water Puppies Just play Skyrim for the ten thousandth time like a normal person Then get the Steam version https://twitter.com/maralinasakura/status/1279145938607628288?s=21 Also vote in my 100% non-biased poll Then you fight for Ulfric Stormcloak Youre entitled to your wrong opinion, I suppose ~~Im memeing, please no hate :blobNobully: ~~ I dont agree at all with the segregation in Windhelm but Im certain that that was a thing before he was jarl Ulfric wanted what was best for Skyrim and the Imperials want what is best for the Empire Even if thats at the expense of Skyrim So I had a read because I didnt want to be ignorant about it A lot of it seems to be about he said-she said 1. A lot of people say that he wont send aid to non-Nords or the Grey Quarter because hes racist. He says that hes too busy with the war which in kind of understandable to a degree but he does make the guards help the best they can

2. Theres differing opinions about the segregation of the Grey Quarter. Some say he put them there out of racism and segregation. Theres NPCs that claim differently (see pic). I think theres sides to both here but naming it the Grey Quarter after their skin is a little sus. He does allow non-Nords, like Altmer and Imperials to live in Windhelm though. 

So I think there are elements of racism but I dont think its nearly as extremist as it is told. Its war propaganda at the end of the day so there will always be elements of hyperbole and undermining I know this should be in #multimedia-shabang but :kekwhands: :worry: Clearly I didnt play this game as much as I thought Well, you showed me Thanks for the info, appreciate it genuinely Uh Can you not act like an ass please? You dont need to act like that when I wasnt like that with you. What? Ah Like, Im not offended by being wrong, Im happy to learn more about a plot line that I havent seen in like 2+ years But theres no reason to be like that. I never supported Ulfrics racist acts to begin with and I genuinely thought they were a lot less than they actually are Okay; thank you :ashesweaty: Im not that great with that sort of sarcasm sometimes. Kind of triggers some unpleasant memories but you couldnt know that so sorry if I react a bit too much :ashesweaty: Thank you :nicoheart: Appreciate it Second wave is coming bois UK is just filled with absolute pissheads who think Corona is some sort of game Mexico is going to collapse Long story short: the president is trying to turn the country into North Korea And also their attitude to Corona is if we dont test people then we have no cases I was looking at the cases and the UK probably actually has cases proportionate to the population but it looks like we have loads more because were actually testing people Actually no We probably have far more than proportionate to the population because Boris is useless but we have a lot more than other countries by a fair bit because we test more You mean cured? We do on Twitter, let me see https://twitter.com/dhscgovuk/status/1279074484750876676?s=21 This is the only thing they give So we have no official number but I guess you can do an estimate by the death and total count Yeah, we test a lot of people But My dad had a heart attack earlier this year and he got tested He came back inconclusive :ChercheShrug: Thanks, hes fine now, it was really minor thankfully Corona is horrible after you recover still Your lungs are permanently damaged and I think some even get scarring Just because youre no longer infected doesnt mean youre not significantly weakened And I think thats something a lot of people dont realise If my dad did have it, he got it very mildly But well never know He does have to go have an X-Ray soon though Why doesnt China just stop eating bloody bats Swine flu Swine flu is a type of flu Its not a singular entity Its come back with a new strain Corona is raccoon :gp_skeyes: Uh huh And said plague can be cured with antibiotics Please be careful not to fear monger Its hard to read tone on the internet, you should be careful :worry: Remember when TC&TF was releasing :aaaaaaaaaaah: Mine was The Freshman because they just dropped you in it I havent read/written anything in Wattpad in years It was good back in time but I really cant read anything with bad grammar which is, unfortunately, the majority > Some videos are funny tbh

All I know is Callum Oh my god And Dodge the dog Some do, some dont. I think a lot of the UK nowadays are anti-monarchy but we cant do anything about it I personally dont, neither does my family. Some people are obsessed with Megan and Kate One of them means Harry and Megan Theyre no longer allowed to get money from the royal family or use their titles Uhmmmmm I think most people dont like her because shes American, not because shes POC Marry who you want, I personally dont care. Its not my business Id support you The only member of the royal family I like is the Queen because she has so many good memes. She earnt her right in that regard. Charles is useless, William is the most boring man alive and Harry is a prat You cant say that Hes ginger Trash It comes out for me later because I dont have a key :KEKW: :kekwhands: When will TRR series die Christ, Viv. Take care of yourself and your family You do whatever it takes to help you relax and recover. Im sure the other staff can handle our rambling. :nicoheart: The hell is that ,im Capri-Sun UK I love the lack of an image ,im Caprisun UK bOT It looks like this in the UK Its even hyphenated If I could ban two things in the world I would choose TikTok and Fortnite Also I would ban non-medically caused obese people to have financial benefits Yes If you eat enough and become medically diagnosed as obese to the point you cant work, you can claim benefits And believe me, people genuine do this to get out of work. That Simpsons episode wasnt overplayed Yes Fortnite Because TikTok enables ||pedophiles|| and Fortnite is filled with toxic twelve year olds Unfortunately, we do So if I ever get into power (I dont know why but sure), Im abolishing that benefit Unless its caused by medical issues, youre not allowed Dont be a fat piece of crap Which part Ah yeah It is pretty difficult. Youd have to get a private members bill through to change whatever piece of legislation it comes under And PMBs are a nightmare https://youtu.be/TpHOaJsxgRE Then how about you go educate yourself, Hyper Just think about it This is a video-sharing app with a 13+ rating with common challenges for children to do weird dances It also has a very easy messaging system True, but TikTok is the worst offender of them all as its actual videos It can be but TikToks whole thing is to create silly videos Instagram is whatever you like And what 2-D said Of course not Im not saying they are because of course they arent. But TikTok is definitely the main offender right now, and then Snapchat Problem is is that Snapchat you have to add people and your photos and videos are temporary. People also know when youve taken screenshots or videos TikTok is like an even more exposure culture than YouTube I dont use Snapchat because the Snapmaps thing gives me anxiety (yes I know you can disable it) Anyway, yeah, while all social media can be used by ||pedophiles||, its definitely TikTok which is the main offender because of the trends/challenges and the full body video format which appeals to young children Mhm I mean that too I stopped playing mostly ||pedophile||? Alright, Ill do it now ~~that should be all of them, let me know if I missed one~~ His eyes Do not change Thats really creepy from a psychological standpoint Eh, Mark can sell my data all he wants.

No, theres no previous precedent that Im aware of because publicity in history was the king and thats it If you werent the heir, you were the spare. If youre a woman, nobody cares about you Everything Theyve made everything a joke And theres so many conspiracy theories that Meghan will be the next Diana Race is a part of it Not for me because Im not a bloody racist I just hate everyone but Elizabeth Oh yeah How do I get rid of that It doesnt say how to get rid of it though Oh wait :KEKW: There we go :nicoshake: Im no longer Drewified :kekwhands: Sure, boo :LysitheaSmug: Honey, where is my supersuit?!
