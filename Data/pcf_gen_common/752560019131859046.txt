Hello. Uhm I am quite new to the app but Queen B looks good so far. Unfortunately, no character was able to capture my heart till now  yeah. I was actually looking for some recommendations. I am planning to planning to continue playing The Royal Romance. Ahh episode! I still remember my IRL friend asking if I played it and I asked - "Is that the one where they move like this *enacts zombie walk*" and she said - yes! but we don't talk about it (the animation) here. XD iirc, luckypatch used to work on episode. Idk if they fixed it now though Has been a while since I played
