Hey y'all! Not too bad! Just taking a little break from studying so ig I'll type up an intro? You got it Hey y'all, my name's Aaron but you can call me Frat if you want (your choice)
 
My favorite books are honestly probably QB, OH (1 and 2 right now bc chile....), THM, PM, and BB.

Favorite (non LI) characters would have to be Olivia Nevrakis, Poppy Min Sinclair, Sienna Trinh (there's probably more but I'm indecisive)

Favorite LIs are Ethan Ramsey, Professor Kingsley, Skye, Marc Antony, and Thomas Mendez

Outside of choices, I'm from North Carolina, USA, currently a uni student majoring in Meteorology. I love travelling, cooking, eating, and coffee That took way longer than I thought it would oops I'm really indecisive when it comes to absolute favorites, etc so honestly if you're just curious about something specific I could probably give a better answer sksksk Lemme vanish chile... Thank y'all! Oh no sksks But I am a gemini That reminds me of something that happened yesterday lmao My friend is planning a beach trip for her birthday next week and I..may have created a shares google maps list of restaurants within a 10 minute drive sorted by price O P T I O N S But enough about me lmao What's everyone's favorite/least favorite book Literally half my closest friends are either leo's or scorpios Noted!

Yello Cyan Ide WICKED IS COMING BACK TO BROADWAY OMG @kyo GREEN GIRL IS BACK https://c.tenor.com/Mf3ZBe3Lm7wAAAAM/nani-intensifies-nani.gif That's what I heard This is so unrelated but I'm curious Has anyone here played Danganronpa I just finished Trigger Happy Havoc and I just started 2 Stan Sakura Ogami So I'm still on the prologue of V2 and um...what the actual fuck Usami is now monomi and monokuma came out of nowhere and???? Also Byakuya is back but he's gained weight???? Like A LOT of weight??? Wym? Oops sorry Wym? Ngl I have no clue I started the prologue a few weeks ago, stopped playing, and then I finished all the cases this week lmao Talking about the first one Spoilerland? Um chile Hi  Hola server Hi  Hello hello hello Good morning luvs Not my manager forgetting to give me a break on a 6 hour shift  I'm still pissed about it trust me As a silver lining, I got tips for once (vv uncommon bc I'm working fast food) It's only $4 but the thought counts My official title is "team member" Which means I run curbside mobile orders, expedite at the drive thru, take carryout orders, make drinks, etc Yes, yes it is In the lovely summer heat too Yes yes I should've See why I'm so annoyed about this now? Hello hello hello Hi hi people Good morning P So I climbed a lighthouse today It was so fun omggg That and I went to some protected sand dunes Incredible tbh I'm obsessed y'all Did I just hear AUDRA MCDONALD BIIIITCH Good morning! Nice And thank y'all! Yes pls And thank y'all That sounds like a blessing, not an addiction  Give in to it  What's your usual order? Uhhh Thai curry >>>> I actually haven't had red though, I normally get Massaman lmao I'm assuming it's a little spicier? Just a little bit Ugh yesss I live Oop- I heard someone say Beyonce and came running Stream the b'day album for clear skin That is all Wait they were bullying raini I only saw the meme abt her That was such a moment WAIT I have a throwback meme about that So I used to play big brother games on Kik YEARS ago right And it became a big joke to call me the skinny legend... One day somebody made this monstrosity WE LITERALLY USED THIS PIC AS MY CONTESTANT PROMO FOR ONE OF THE GAMES I'M SICK SKSKSKSKKS  Oh my Idk what that is but it looks tasty Brb finding a recipe Noted!! Ugh I love cooking Any interesting recipes you've tried recently? See I don't really listen enough to claim any groups but off the top of my head I've listened to twice, loona, blackpink, CL/2NE1, and red velvet at least once Now My turn to ask about everyone's music taste  Does anyone here like Broadway musicals  yaY Yes it does  So my current faves are Wicked, Phantom of the Opera, and Hamilton Well maybe not current faves, they're more so my "permanent" faves I tend to cycle between others as secondary faves AS YOU SHOULD Ok, favorite song off the soundtrack? I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT Of the 3 I listed wicked is my top fave I'm planning on seeing the tour this fall too Guns and Ships thooo The Schuyler Sisters is my main friend group's go to sing along track I try to claim Peggy or Eliza every time Lol maybe I'm biased bc I lowkey don't care for the wiki fandom but Books centered around romance talking about falling in love? How SHOCKING AND LAUGHABLE /s How do you get these big cries to happen It feels like I internalize so much that I can't get some feelings to come forth most of the time Either that or it just feels inappropriate I feel like I've had those but I just feel worse about it, it's just quieter bc I'm tired Fair warning this might turn into a paragraph But I can remember one time this happened at college last semester and I was crying and freaking out and eventually I did get quiet bc I was well, exhausted. But afterwards instead of feeling relieved I just felt embarrassed that it all happened and that I didn't carry myself in a better way. Plus this was in my dorm so I was scared that people mightve heard me as they walked past my door And to this day I still think they did because I noticed stares in my direction after I left my dorm that day She do vibe while helping us tho Omg Y'all I got bored and gender swapped Ethan Ramsey and... LOOK AT HER ABSOLUTE SERVE?? Y'all talking about Italian food has me craving tiramisu now I made my own slightly improvised version at home once Everything was right except I couldn't find lady fingers so I had to use spongy cake instead unfortunately Surprisingly yes The texture was a little bit fluffier because of the cake but it soaked up even *more* of the coffee flavor Good morning Y'all random question I just found out I'm off work tomorrow morning and I feel like actually taking my time and cooking for breakfast Any dish ideas? I normally make pancakes when I have time but I feel like changing it up I'm open to omelettes Home fries...you make points Lets see if I have any potatoes Noted noted So I've narrowed it down to breakfast casserole, omelette, frittata, or crepes Plus apparently my sister just got some tofu yesterday so...the options are very promising I'm thinking breakfast scramble filled crepes or a tofu omelette Yes yes I will Plus I have this new coffee blend I've been meaning to try Thank you Lu  It does feel nice knowing I can wake up at my own pace this Monday Bc my work schedules have been a hot mess Not really too grueling but I'm getting whiplash Like...no Also they keep cutting my hours which kinda annoys me I picked up on that SO quickly and it's shady as fuck This isn't the first time I've suspected shit with their scheduling Did I tell y'all in this server about the whole issue with my breaks Yes exactly that The thing about my hours this week is I *requested* Friday morning off specifically And I told them I could work an afternoon shift So why they gave me the full day AND Monday off? I have no clue Normally I'd be happy about being off 2 days but like...ngl give me my hours and my coin pls Even then I'm better off than some of my friends One girl I work with told them she can't do more than 20 hours in a week and they gave her this schedule She works front of house like I do but she has another job and is a student as well Well I mean I am too but iirc she's doing something over the summer Here you can see the same weird ass inconsistent scheduling 10-3 or 10-4 all week makes sense but the random 10-8 slapped in the middle... I have another friend who's pulling 2-10s and 2-11s (closing) all week and whew I pray for her Y'know, it *is* brutal out here Guess who just took the mbti  They're dragging me in the description section omg Was yours intj-t too or intj-a Neurotic  https://media1.tenor.com/images/125fa89ea98a9bd938b8344129424616/tenor.gif?itemid=4581307 I wonder what extroversion is like Did. Someone say homophobic chicken? Hello hello hello Oh my god y'all Something happened at work that had my dying No it's funny this time So when we have busy periods we ask customers for their names to put on orders bc it just makes everything easier But sometimes the person who puts the names on their orders misspells them ofc bc were all human employees So apparently this one lady's name was Mara Somehow the person who took her order wrote her name down as Bara It took me every last but of energy in my body not to cackle ~~pls tell me y'all know what Bara is so y'all understand why it was funny~~ Oh that's interesting but no KSNSKSKS It's a subgenre of BL Somewhat related to yaoi Let me just Welp, the humor didn't land but c'est la vie *cough* Muriel supremacy I haven't played the arcana in forever omggg I should redownload it He's a gentle giant How do we summon you Ouija board?

But yeah I'm kinda happy to get my free time back Lmao there's actually a company policy against dating Well not against it but If you date a co worker you're advised to let a manager know that you intend to date them That way they can schedule the 2 people differently  O Did someone say queen b This is now the point in the conversation where we must switch to Ian Kingsley simping Ngl I'd date another meteorologist I can think of TONS of romantic or sexual meteorology puns they'd get like- "You make my heart reach it's level of free convection " B- but....roleplay...and proficiency with hands... Hot This brings me to a philosophical questions Are athletes hotter or are we blinded by their bodies and forgiving their faces One time this whole bus of athletes came through at work and I was so shook I could barely call out orders Wait this reminds me of the time one of my friends saw a white guy she liked and said "I just wanna get colonized like a Caribbean island" Such a powerful statement I will be googling these men and rating WHAT AND YOU DIDN'T TACKLE HIM???

https://c.tenor.com/y1NNjCFMsGEAAAAM/beylordce.gif I'd taste it but I hate the concept All those damn *carbs* It's v weird when people make strange mashups of your region's cuisine lmao Not necessarily bad, just weird *Looks at hipstery yt chefs "discovering" collard greens and other soul/southern food* Lmao upscale restaurants in non southern places slap barbecue/pulled pork and cornbread on a dish and all of a sudden it's the "yeehaw down south country plate" Sisksosk I need to learn more about the cuisine really P Hello all I'm Sleep deprived And when I get sleepy I get all giggly It's a v weird feeling right now I can't explain in Like how people tried to drag Jamie Lee Curtis who is famously pro gun reform/control for playing a character in a horror movie who used a gun *meteorology intensifies* Meanwhile here the high for tomorrow is 73  It's December, I hate this Yuh Coconut oil is *the* haircare product She's a very powerful substance Not really, especially for people with thicker or curlier hair textures Hope she'll be okay oof We Stan wtd OMGGG I love that show So here are my thoughts The show itself gets very messy but in a campy way If you take everything *too* seriously you might not enjoy it as much so be aware that you *can* laugh at the drama Yes but with a little more soap opera flair Also Liz Gillies is insane in the role Imagine Jade but with a polished silver and gold exterior instead of a rough edge Fallon Carrington could make Poppy ~~Nakamura~~ Min-Sinclair sweat Yes she does sing but as far as I remember it's a one off Unless she sings more in season 4 which I haven't seen The only thing I will say comparing poppy to Fallon though...not enough WLW activity Yesss Like a champ YUP    Hello  It's going like that I am negro  My love of white men runs in the family apparently EOOWWWW Lemme feel myself real quick Thanks mom Tbh most of my uncles on her side keep most of their hair too so yay Oh @kyo explain thyself SOSKSKS I'm joking with you Very very light where I live I live closer to the south so we kinda got a dusting that's already melting away now Where are you fae Oh yikes Yeah New England has been getting hit hard My weather nerd is hopping out Pretty much this is what's bringing such heavy snow Those low pressure systems marked by the L's bring rain normally, but with cold enough conditions it brings snow Throwback to when it did snow heavier here last week My classmates were in our group chat going crazy As met majors do Fae have you heard of snow cream It's mainly a southern thing but You're in the prime position to try it if it's still actively snowing It's a little seasonal dessert we make sometimes when it snows Sit a bowl outside while it's snowing to collect some snow (some people say it's ok to take some off the top of the ground bc it's "clean". Ignore these people) Then add sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, plus whatever else you want, making sure the texture stays pretty thick and not too slushy My birthday used to fall on the last day of school which was fun  *surrender intensifies* Greetings What's going on We are...still in school I'm in a weird spot I normally have so much work to do but this week my workload has been unusually light That should be a good thing but it's making me nervous because I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop This week is pretty full of meaningful events tho ngl I choose my dorm for next semester this Thursday and I've been planning what room I want for weeks Long story short I want a single room and certain room numbers in the dorm hall I want are designated as singles So for the past 2 weeks I've been using the last semester's single room list combined with floor plans to determine which room numbers are the best fit for me Now I just have to see if all that work pays off Here's hoping Ofc Update: It paid off but not in the way I expected Room selection was scheduled for tomorrow morning right? So this afternoon I checked my student account to see if I could find the list of updated singles and factor that into my plan ...I scroll down and what do you know...they fucked up and opened the room selection EARLIER THAN THEY SAID THEY WOULD Thankfully I rushed and got one of my top pick rooms And I'm happy about that but I'm also mad because...wtf...if it weren't for sheer coincidence and luck my entire plan could've been dismantled What did I walk in on Sorcery Cassie has fans?  Lexi supremacy And Maddy ofc Yassss Oh Nice For women imo "tall" starts at like 5'9" or 5'10 And for men closer to 5'11 or 6' I am 5'9"  I love tall men tho I have this one friend who's 6'2" and he's so... long Like I look up to make eye contact with him I stand on my toes to rest my arm on his shoulder It's crazy My ex uncle is 6'9" Oh I LOVE this game now wtf Just got it in 11, more than I would've wanted but it's hard on my phone for some reason As someone on the spectrum That's totally valid Well I was diagnosed when I was 4 so I didn't have much of a chance to deny it lmao Yeah there's a weird bias about gender and autism Me  Yes sadly I thought it was just seasonal allergies but I think it might be turning into a sinus infection Depends He's either an asshole, hot, or both And lord have mercy when they don't skip leg day....
