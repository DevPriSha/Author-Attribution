Omg a friend! Hiiiii  is this the proper channel to ping staff? thanks, oh just to get the 18+ role. I saw I need to ping to inquire but it did not specify where I should do it Yes hello! thank you for the warm welcome  That IS a flex my only flex was being a chaotic heaux in my teen years and being awarded the good girl title by almost everyone my friends: there is an imposter among us Science was my best subject for some reason. It came easy to me but I had no idea how to help my friends learn the information cause I didn't know how I understood it GO ... bone #206 the end. my chemistry prof was the biggest bully. I had to take the course to get into my nursing program and I picked the last open slot which was with the worst rated instructor. everything was group assignments and I continually got points docked for what they claimed was me "not actively participating and completing assigned portions" aka they thought I was mooching off my classmates work. the program has a specific requirement of passing the course with a C+ (77) and they failed me with a 76. I'm a Registered Nurse  yeah, this was before I was accepted into the program 3 years ago. truly, the good ones are saints Aw, thank you for that but I'm just a new grad. I got my feet wet doing what I had to do and hopefully saved some lives and reconnected loved ones. Hi! Welcome  My interest in Chris Evans started with Johnny Storm. Cocky, charming hottie. I was done for. He has not disappointed sense. Look-wise, I mean. Some of his movie and conversation points are arguable lol The superior Chrises :uwu: Prom for me was pregaming at my best friend's house while our dates tried to catch glimpses of us in our lingerie, getting more drunk as we walked our butts to the venue, and then partying in the hotel room our friend rented in that exact place, and then making it home to fire up the grill for munchies hour no rooftop makeouts but in the locked, dark gym/locker room was a good spot unless you wanted to steam up your car lol that's a typical friday night for me LOL they are but more because of the social media attention you get everyone wants to go viral Not always. It is a significant time if you've been in a high school relationship but it's not always the case with everyone truly, my first time was not at prom lmfao. It was less cliche and more reckless than that fat mood couldn't be me it was fun going to the parties and seeing who cheated on who after being all lovey-dovey at school ohmygod, yes. every high school has that one *couple* that isn't a couple but everyone was rooting for it's me. anyone had a student teacher relationship at their high school? cause mine missed that trope. we had a lot of preggo teens but it was from other teens. No Ian Kingsley romances for us there was this one hot english teacher in the room beside mine. but I never tried it cause he was engaged to another english teacher she looked like Cindy from Whoville my parents are 11 years apart so they wouldn't even blink if I went for someone with that age gap or more its so gross, but it was older times, ya know? My dad being a high schooler and my mom being a..... you know. child. LOL. She was 15. Her mom was okay with it cause you know, early marriage and shit. My mom got pregnant at 22 so she made it far tbh her sister (my aunt) got pregnant at 14. so, she was the better of the two tbh it also helps to explain that we are from P.R. and that we don't have middle school. So, literal 10 year olds have the same halls as 18 year olds. it's all mixed together because 10th grade is when you go to the other campus next door. but its all the same courtyard and cut access between buildings Puerto Rico I wear a respirator, goggles, face mask over it, face shield, gown smoc, and disposable gown for 18 hours in the Covid unit with 40 beds. rehab. it's where those recently released come or where they get sent back because they're collapsing Thanks. It starts with all of you mask-wearers doing your part. It's tough work, it's hard work, but when you help your community, it decreases our workload and helps the nation thank you but I'm just one of millions. everyone in the community that does their part are the real hero's I'm doing my job but y'all are doing your part as humans can I just say when I was studying to get my license I would always talk to my friends/family and say how cool it would be to have my place in the frontlines of something huge. I pictured triaging maybe a few car accidents or something and then I got hit with the pandemic careful what you wish for lol poor thing, wish you the best of luck! if your nurses or any health professionals are being less than kind remind them that you're suffering too. the worst is having someone who is tired and frustrated taking it out on you  Nope. It's so tricky. (also, hey! I'm 23 as well!). Lots of young people our ages are getting it and it affects some of them even worse than someone older. It's maddening how little information we still have on it. It's crazy, but not really, how quiet covid kept in the hospitals before our hands were forced and we had to make the public aware. I'm trying to be the change in these organizations cause corporations are disgusting. Has it been working well for you? I've done those for those who have tension migraines to try and ease up the muscles in the neck and surrounding Ugh, I love that for you! I'm a migraine victim too but it's not always tension related so it's not as helpful for me. but I'll never turn down a free massage lol His name is Jojo. He was adopted from family friends of friends who were abusive to him :(. He's doing so much better but if he misbehaved and I use my stern voice he panicked and submitted very quickly. it would take like 20 minutes for him to even begin to calm down. We've worked hard on it and now hes confident and a rascal. If I catch him biting on my sneakers, he'll just wag his butt and does the "catch me if you can" dance lol. It makes me so happy to see him bold and trusting. he loves showers! if I go in for a bath just to relax, I have to make sure I close the door tightly or he'll wiggle his way in and plop inside with me lol. He's 5 now. starting to be grumpy around kids and likes his quiet so we are good company during school hours. we just had a doggy birthday with his other friends in August. 5 little years. imagine being friends with him?? like any stranger would be calling the police to report some suspicious activity lmao but they're like, its coo; Just Viv being Viv VIV BLINK TWICE IF YOU ARE OKAY at the risk of sounding like those meddling Karen's... but ring? yes or no? maybe? soon? never? HOTTIE May I direct you to my local Spirit Halloween? I'm sure they got a sale or two on those Imagine having a boyfriend which is a cross between Jax and Thomas. Viv wins at life. totes, I am way too involved in this relationship that I just learned about 7 minutes ago. but I am here and I'm ready. it would be a tease to not share one https://tenor.com/view/identical-my-cousin-vinny-gif-10329535 SJSDHHDSJDDFS LOVE THAT a love story!!! my prom date had a crush on me but I friendzoned him hard... being my date was me being kind to him to make up for it  mom's spaghetti? WHY IS EVERYONE IN THIS DAMN CHAT IN A CUTE RELATIONSHIP WHY ARE Y'ALL CUTE IN GENERAL me: potato. hot pocket me: 23 and eating a tub of ice cream whilst watching soaps No, I have Bumble literally soaps is what I call anything that makes me cry LOL Aw, recommend me them and I will! I watch spanish soaps but I like the classics Every match I had was a muscle tee, snapback wearing white man holding a flounder  not me with a non-existent accent listening to beautiful ones plain and boring is what I am hold on, my guinea pigs are squealing in the background I am an idiot and realized my mic isn't working  Me: talking to myself like an idiot CATS movie... as in the one with Taylor Swift? am I reading this correctly? I've never watched it, but my friend did after I warned her against it she said it was just what she pictured it being visuals wise but musically its good lol I'll watch it with the group! I've never heard of this so I am interested OH interesting! I love that story Maybe I sound like a robot and its why I didn't speak yesterday....  yeah, I went to private middle school which was filled with drama kids. We put on the show and all that. I like it CUTE!! I was never into the acting on stage, but I was Persephone when we did mythology. I was more into the orchestra. I played the violin Kyo.. is that a free template?? https://tenor.com/view/ba-dum-tsss-drum-band-gif-7320811 Good luck Kyo!! Just trust yourself in what you know and it'll go well. Be confident cause that is the key idk about everywhere else but here in MA they are sending them to take driving lessons to rack up hours and then they are eligible for driver's license that's what my niece is doing  oh no. why? which part is it, the driving or just doing it in front of someone? the driving is just a matter of following the rules. as long as the rules of the road are followed you will be fine. as for the examiner.. don't pay them any mind unless they're speaking. they don't really talk or ask questions unless they want to and just rather observe you the stuff. they'll prompt you when its time to do something so don't overthink or stress about the stuff before hand god, I can't tell you how many times I'm driving I slip into autopilot like I just do it automatically and then suddenly I am home not actual autopilot on the car, just muscle memory not to wish it on you, but the more relaxed and experienced, it'll happen its just your brain telling you "this is familiar" and takes over that is why its recommended to always take new roads so it doesn't happen omg stick shift buddies!  lmao yes we do. not many drive it cause of convenience but its what I learned to drive and I love my first car was stick and its still with me today you're still awesome despite it just fawn over me driving it and you're golden, Drew Hey, if it makes you feel better, I started driving early and illegally out of necessity OMG best thing about driving cars is the concert. I be wailing in that ish screw that. you wanna know what proves independence to me? someone who knows how to use public transportation anyone can pop the GPS and drive there not many can actually know the stops and locations lmao who said america had the best we just doing our best baby but its just 1% effort I literally just said lmao. america sucks, we been knew Amen to that preach it to me I know thats right we suck, the end. no more to be said lol wait, as much as I love this convo we need to get Kyo prepared for tomorrow WE NEED CONFIDENCE K Y O Confidence. You have it. Tap into it. Own it it is one exam, that many have taken and passed. even people who do not belong on the road that's how I remind myself, even if it sounds bad like if they can do it, there is no excuse for me BUT DID HE PASS ON THE 12TH IT DOES NOT MATTER passing is passing no one keeps count but you and that one DMV apparently hi, hello. Mom? We are encouraging the heck out of Kyo. please join BOOM. okay, Kyo, you rock. the end. thanks mom/ but why idk who bread is but hello bread I love bread idk em but i love them already imagine flushing your toilet at 10:01:00 and the police break down your front door freeze, police! oof. ugh I would hate to be the person who wakes in the morning to flush all that  bestow the knowledge on us I think its a cool idea. I would participate and prob suggest questions if you make a place for it. I also responded because I dont want Kyo to be bothered pinging Im the one to the right of Viv asking myself how much she paid for her boobs its Viv, come on. She gets what she wants Oh hunny... I am def bigger than you I wish I was that size again. I think my perfect size was C. Perky and handful. when the government thinks that every household members money is your money. because I make a certain amount of money means that all of that is just sitting in my savings. As head of household its so frustrating having to submit 3 different forms of income verification because if Im head of household, I must be rich.

Nope. Im head of household because the other members are disabled. I went to community college as well. best choice I made. affordable and you choose how hard you want to push yourself I did all scholarships and no loans cause I don't want to spend the rest of my life paying off debt. are you not allowed to have one right now Kyo? I had one since I was 15 seriously I was forced to be here against my will now poverty has kept me as its slave it is so hard being the child of parents who did the big move to restart their lives in a place they've never been before (even if it was from P.R.) just because its dangled over your head. they have that 'I came here on my own and worked small jobs to earn money and look at us now' congrats kyo!!

I dont condone smoking in tight spaces, private property, or damn near anyone who doesnt ask for it. It seems like your intentions are in the right place but it's something that seems to have been dealt with internally and it will stay like that. Try not to get involved. Hi Rae, I hope you're doing better  I could do better physically, seems like I'm coming down with a cold, but emotionally and mentally I am fine. Thank you for asking. Happy to hear! omg is it time I was gonna ask you earlier but you've been gone Its cookies n cream for me. Belle, vanilla is not boring! Theres so many different ways to enhance it.

What happened to yours? :(( wait no omg. the poor thing I seriously hate mob mentality and bullying Is that Jeremy? Dude, that fucking sucks. I want to say like I cant believe it but I totally can. Wasnt it like a month or two ago that a singer/group mate from Little Mix also left because of constant bullying. I dont even want to say that hes not fat cause thats beside the point. No one should comment on anothers appearance. No bullying. Mind your business and shut your trap if you have nothing nice to say Disgusting. I just skimmed the comments and I saw the same. A lot of youre a bad actor and you were given a bad storyline A lot of people keep saying he had just came back... do they mean to Twitter or on the show? Ok. I wasnt sure if he suspended his account previously from all the hate Not a bad idea at all. If he does that, he will only see the good stuff and itll help his mental health. I hope he does get the help he needs and considers returning to a show he loves Hey, Im sorry Hutch. For your comfort actor to attacked so much that hes leaving a show you like. And for him being attacked so much that he felt forced to leave for his own well-being  Hi!

SAT 1285, ACT 32 for me. All the prep courses worked I thought doing amazing on those exams wouldve meant I could conquer the world but in reality, it meant shit if you couldnt afford the top colleges that wanted you. Full ride is rare. I also made it my personal obligation to be accepted fully in merit and not because I provided a sob story to be considered. I was too stubborn and prideful Eat the rich. Scholarships are completely independent and given for any reason upon application. You can get a scholarship for being left handed lmao. Financial aid is federal assistance but its based off income so you arent guaranteed all or any. Student loans are assistance but needs to be paid back, with interest. Its all very messy but you find what works best with you. Never forget when I wanted to be a doctor so I can find out the cure for all the diseases that big pharma has locked away so I can help the community At age 9, I was planning a revolution lmao Its a cycle. They make it seem like you need a degree to be a well-payed professional, but not everyone can get degrees or it lowers the prestige that comes with it, so they make it harder and less accessible. Its counterproductive to us who seek to better ourselves but its productive to those to maintain the social classes and stigma Ive been summoned BABE FUCKING CALL SOMEONE check your pulse Tell me if you feel it and if you feel someone touching it or any sensations FYI Im dming Viv lmfaooo.

I remember being young and searching all the top schools in the world and hoping to apply then community college tuition looked hella good any experience with either? catdog Depends on their specific needs, but yes, cats are considered to be more independent if that equals responsibility to you do you want to play around with them? take them out with you when you're running errands or just outside? protect you? dogs. go to an animal shelter, spend some time with both and see which one calls to you I have lost three nose studs in the past 2 weeks. At this rate, it would be cheaper to just let it close lol I always told myself that when I let one close, it will be the end of that. So, I do my best to keep them all open. I've been getting tired of some and might bite the bullet but apparently my nose has other plans lol I have three on each lobe and a tragus. I love the trag and considered doing the one of the other side I also want a cartilage but not sure which I had a industrial phase but all my friends got theirs infected and I said nah Once it gets to a certain size, yeah. My cousin has them and has been shrinking them for years. Very slow process random, but I do not like the Discord icon change. I liked it more as a circle it went from a circle to a box on mine You need help, Bel? I can lend some advice since I am familiar with some places Chegg, Amazon rentals, and online free textbook databases are my go-to you can always ask the professor if the edition of a book matters! some of them are strict but others are understanding of situations and will allow an edition or two behind the current one if the information is not that different that will also save some bucks I personally would be a little more professional about? How about: Hello,
In preparation for the upcoming course, I need clarification on the recommended textbook vol and ed.

Thank you,
(insert name here) Do make sure to check the syllabus and see which one is stated there because most professors will direct you back to it. the volume but not the edition? so ask if the edition of the book is okay. try to look into the volume so you're covered on both ends but that is my suggestion valid have you searched the pdf link in other websites? they might have it I mean, go ahead and just ask about it. worst they can say is no I need to take this test I think Im ESTJ I sound like a boring bitch on paper lmao Not me being Elsa LET IT GO Wait mine is not listed Does that mean I have no prince :(( I am a princess with no prince. The crime! I like how youre just inserting yourself in their relationship lmfaooo Aladdin was my first Disney crush so I gotta go with him too. I always wanted to be Jasmine but with the red fit on. She was a babe. theres a buzzfeed page dedicated to bisexual awakenings and theyre all on there You should give it a read. Its hilarious Good ones!

How do the instructors differentiate an 11 year old from a 15 year old? that is why we use the term: freshman (1st year), sophomore (2nd year), junior (3rd year), and senior (4th year) so we can talk about a specific graduating class. is it up to year 4? oh you mean ALL the years wo wow *head scratches* okay, that one kinda confused me but I got the gist of it thanks for explaining! I am used to it cause its been my whole educational life but back home in PR, my cousin is one year younger than myself, but in grade name, he is one class above me because they have a slight difference in how they divide the schools grade as in year haha, yup. he would always tease me that he was smarter cause he was in a higher year than myself but it was just because I lived in the states we have too many names to differentiate years did you just list that backwards? w h y lmaooo fancy Harvard is here so I know that lol unless you were keeping secrets :shifty: Hope I don't have any fans showing up to my address It is lmfao @Boor welcome! challenges feature HUH?

He was talking about his last relationship and how he was worried itll affect his new one and he just pulls up a photo of his ex-bf and goes isnt he so cute?. I loved it. He told me that I was the least scariest to come out to and that he knew I wouldnt even blink so he wanted to have fun with it :heresthemf: As an aunt of 4 and cousins of like 20...

You have anything to soften your stomach? ginger ale or anything like that hot stay upright, or propped on pillows, drink something that calms your stomach, stay away from food and it should go away Hate to be a party pooper but we gotta shut it down. Mmm. Do you have a fever? Check your hot pocket box. Could it be expired or gone wrong? When you were eating ok vc you kept going what am I eating? Was it cause it tasted bad or Is anyone around you sick or showing any symptoms of might be getting sick You may have just bought them but were they sold before expiration. Thats the biggie You may have just bought them but were they sold before expiration. Thats the biggie Pink is misleading because when you throw up youre forcing your muscles to expel the stuff which is traumatic for your throat. Plus, acid also erodes which adds to the pink. Coffee grounds in vomit is very bad. anyways, could be food poisoning since its quick but only if no one else around you is sick. You couldve been exposed to a virus and just showing symptoms now LMAO. small mercy ummm.... could take 48 hours. But yeah, lets cross our fingers for tonight. once its out of your stomach.. which it seems, it should get better Why not Bet so, water upset my stomach even more so if you're the same don't drink that you got gatorade or anything similar @azula sigh technically I am free now tell your friends the feeling will be the last to go away its like a hangover Of course you did you're just taking Ls I showered, did my hair, dressed professionally.... for a 5 minute phone call. hate. it. here. are you okay babe?? any idea what couldve caused it The way you never finished your last thought. SHHHH.  without ME? how rude yeah, I know that is why I waited to pop up and ask but you still ignored me Viv is a noodle Valentine's Day event :elmofire: soo.... who is  down this Valentine's Day? Not me  LMAO couple mood America locked me down faster than any man could very entitled kjsfjsffhs omg my fave hobbie smash and dash bang and dip you need Viv's permission :aww: Tinder is for dick pics, Bumble is for compliments and surprised dick pics, and Hinge is for an undercover hoe I haven't tried that one hold on nvm.... lmao I met my first fwb on omegle .....  :heresthemf: let me tell you as a certified hoe and a het- men ain't shit.  interesting they're great conversationalists too but don't force yourself to feel something honestly, who even needs labels. do what you want as long as you're happy, safe, and respectful she's lebanese gosh Viv, so insensitive did you mean Jojo Siwa? or did Greta also come out? FUCK I knew it was coming her hairline makes me cry as someone whose profession asks for the hair to be pulled back, I weep at how tight hers as. breaking her roots and receding her hair I bleached my hair for about 4 years. oof blonde asf looked pretty, but man did it just wreck my shit. I will only ever do it again with a professional my natural hair was always a mix between dark blonde and light brown. as I got older it got darker but I still had those blonde low tones in them I can't ever get it back, which is sad I don't have one and my hispanics ancestors weep I need to take better care of my hair and rejuvinate my curls hold on, I'll post a pic of little me in #wholesome-pictures you can see what my hair was like actual or bought? Will do. So, yeah. I dyed my hair dark brown after the blonde to let it rest and get healthy with a massive trim I did and its stayed dark since then. People keep asking me if I dyed it darker and I havent touched it in over 6 years. Open curls too, the weight of my hair pulls it down Dont. I dyed burgundy, maroon, blonde, did teal highlight, blue highlights, hi and lo lights, and now dark brown. Yup. I love reminding men that beauty is expensive so drop that dough if you want me to continue being hot I dont have one but I also date scummy men so you learn a few tricks Men like an arm candy. You know when they like that certain lingerie or when they like your nails done because backstratches and all that jazz? Capitalize on it. Go a day or two without them and let them casually ask for it. IF they're jerks, they'll pretend tease about you getting lazy. That's when you strike. Tell them that you just haven't had the time, or got some upcoming bills so you'll take a while but it'll be done when you got the time. Tell them if they like it so much you can skip date at *insert expensive date here* and that you can just have a spa date works for me every time and by then they're just programmed to know that the more they treat you right, the more they earn in return if not, con their ass and say that you got someone else that treats you to these stuff like a real man. Men can't help themselves to join in on the pissing contest fwb 101 for the record, I'm an independent ass bitch but also when men have their stuff they like (aka waxed, etc) I make sure they know that their services have fees if its for me, that's another thing. Valid For me, I don't need them to but if its for them, they can pay for it. I don't force them if they don't want to, since half the stuff I would already do, but the demanding of it is when I switch. 23, 24 on Friday rough, you need to go play catch up on all the missed time. just remember you're wicked young and you got all the time in the world every man is different, take it case by case lol these are all hookups, I don't do relationships so it'll be a different ballgame when I decide to be in one Im crying in the club Are you better now?

What I got it lol Im half asleep So I will watch your beekeeping adventures another day no NyQuil this time, school exhausted me is our homosexual helping? LMAO Oop lmao the way I don't use Tik Tok enough so I'd be confused asf are you talking about forms that ask for race? what do you put for your nationality? or ethnicity okay so I'm not helpful cause my forms have different groups listed. don't think any have ever asked me if I am mixed race. but I agree, I would say you're multi so choose that mhm I've never watched Moana :IDKher: I need to do that pretty I was just gonna say that let me try to do my hw and its a date spl not this argument again lmfao I lack all piracy ethics morals who? I do :Bbay: I can bust out my scener. we will be on vc *talking* but *streaming* outside of the server you missed twerking your phat asscheek on it opportunity wasted make their pockets hurt baddun dun dun dun we do :pleb: alright, imma speedrun my homework in case we can watch it this week Friday depending on the time cause birthday dinner and all that jazz for me thx babe it always amuses me how freely people wish an early bday when its a superstition to us LMFAO in case I don't live to the day nice trust me, no feelings hurt if you forget. no big deal to me, I'm just growing older and greyer das me you could be right, but I'm used to hearing early wishes from anyone but hispanics irl Not wish an early happy birthday? For Puerto Ricans its basically testing fate. You're basically wishing for something great before the day arrives for which you may not make it to that day. Mal de ojo type stuff. (evil eye) Yeah, so we aren't against it 100%. We won't think you have bad intentions when you do it but if someone does it, a loved one will follow it with a prayer/blessing. I say it all the time to others cause obviously living in the states my entire life you get used to others customs. It's just funny to notice Yup! I'm not an overly superstitious person but there are incidences (read coincidences) where I'm like hmm.... maybe I should just *not* do this. I wore a very expensive, idk how many karat gold bracelet once time that was gifted by my godmother. I treasured it so much that I would only wear it for special occasion. Believe it or not, it was to protect the evil spirits from. Well, I wore it to someone's house and got immediately complimented on it "oh wow so pretty, where did you get it? how long have you had it for?" and that night when I was home I realized it wasn't on my wrist anymore. I panicked and searched everywhere and I found it beneath my car's driver seat. The clasp broke. It be your own people. Aww, sorry to hear. Have you ever tried repairing them? Maybe you can. I hope you can. Mood Besides taking a day off and eat yummy food? Nothing really. I can't go to the clubs or the casino like I've done in the past but it makes no difference to me. I never thought my birthday had to be a big deal cause I try to spend every other day of the year as birthday, if that makes sense. Thank you! Haha, it's so bland. I eat hispanic cuisine all the time so we are going to Texas Roadhouse lmfao I love their bread and sweet butter woo! good luck!  I just had to confirm 5 references for this position I applied for I now have a headache lol Damn.

Too bad in part of the team most people hate LOL Thanks! Nothing new for us but 100% will be safe We signed Kike! Not my fave but always happy for Puerto Rican rep so unattrative I liked Cody Bellinger he's like a good mix of talent and cocky, but he does cross the line at times for that season in particular tho Puig *coughs* LMFAO unfortunate typo but so hilarious Yall know how we did that test that Viv shared about the US stuff? Well, Groundhog Day passed and guess what. lil fucker saw its shadow What Drew said. Im annoyed. Groundhog is actually pretty accurate. Doesnt mean we wont have inaccuracies because climate change is a problem People with diseases usually own a dog or cat cause they can sense the chemical imbalance before they even show symptoms. Animals are fucking awesome. mhm its arthritis. It flares up I mean, we kinda did explain the science behind it. Animals are intuitive because that is their habitat. They sense the changes that could be detrimental to them and we act according to their behavior. Life doesnt change cause there are more 6 weeks of winter or not, its just a heads up that we may have more snow and lower temps. People respond to that warning as they want. Youre questioning the accuracies of an animal lol. The animal has to survive out there so yeah, mistake can be made but how likely is it that without an external factor they will die off because one of them read the climate wrong? Not likely. Anyways, we got almost 17in of snow on Groundhog Day and now we are expected to see another half foot today and that does not include what will be continuing this weekend. I want to be outside  You take it up with the experts who you think are wrong. Its a cute thing and in my entire life of living here, it has barely been inaccurate plus, children love it. We dont only go off by the shadow, its what we say to the public based off the behaviors assessed I know right, Drew??? Theyre huge. I thought they were small and slim like squirrels until I saw one and I was like wtf. Youre BIG me: so he dont got a shadow but I do? :e_minor: Lol its cool. Im just saying that its not just a shadow thing. They just observe all of it and we tell kids who are to young too understand all that that it saw its shadow and went back into its dwelling instead of staying out and doing whatever it is they do Drew doesnt want to hear about math before math class He needs a break math is ever changing so I wouldnt even bother unless youre an expert I help the kids all the time and its new formulas and new ways to solve and Im just trying to be being a good aunt I just mean its pointless to find new and harder ways to do stuff and force kids to learn that one way I have my way to solve stuff and Im correct. They just wont accept the work cause its now how they decided it should be done Heres a funny story My nephew is 14 and was on ft with his friends. I come into the room to tell him dinner is ready and one of them go oh, is that your mom? And the other one on the group call goes no dumbass, thats his sister Bruh, Im neither. They just know his mom is young and just assumed it was me it was funny cause I went in there complaining about his room not being clean and they follow it up with saying she sounds like my mom Bruh. Im 24. Def not his mom Ive got it since I was young. My niece was born when I was 7 and so whenever I drove her around and stuff, people just assumed I was her teen mom  Creepy men: is that your daughter? She looks just like you.
Me: no; shes my niece and she says you stink: It doesnt help that they call me mom. Theyre just tired of my ass being around lmaoo they accidentally do it. Like if theyre excited and want to show me something theyd be like mom! Oh, I mean Titi and we just move on its me  My cousins all call me titi cause they were jealous they didnt have any why do I picture you being a gay Scott Lee I love it Uwu youre the back in my day shshdhhs uncle jokes are the best, theyre just exaggerated stories where theyre drunk and do dumb stuff merry hoe-mas Also.. you think youre gonna just share its your birthday soon and not drop a date You better tell me.

I hate to burst your bubbles but like..... me: *scrolls up*
also me: I'm lube, ain't I? Late but here are my last nursing notes My handwriting depends on what I use but its decent Shshdjs thats doctors I like my sloppy cursive writing more I use this when I feel professional catholic & baptized as an infant did not do my first communion from moving around much so I "have" to do that sometime LOL I have no interest in any of it. I don't think I have to go to do all parts or go to Church every sunday to prove my faith I'm a good person, give back to my community, literally in a self-less profession and pray as often as I can (or remember to) I give myself a 7/10 byee! You have risen! is it time or must you eat lmao ready when you are Youre clear. Honestly I get it cause Ive been there but it also isnt cool take it from someone who dumped two friends I've known for 10 years if they aren't being good friends now, most likely they won't in the future you know what you deserve and if they're not doing their end... talk to them, work it out, but don't sweep it under the rug or cave that's actually so shitty. Listen, the hardest thing for me when I decided I wasn't going to let my ex-friends walk over me is not wanting to continue giving chances because of the fucked up shit they said or did. I had to remind myself that I put more value in our friendship if it was this hard for me to write them or than I was to them when they did everything they did which pushed me away. its not easy letting go of friends, but no one should be spoken to like that. and if they can't see past their wrongs, they don't deserve you always babe. I do hope you can find a way to talk to them. even a message to say that you want them to say straight up what they expect to come from this.. if you can work past it or not for the closure that's what I did and I think it worked well for me I did in the beginning, but its gotten easier. I stopped doing that and started saying what I can do with my real friends. Even what I can do with myself. Can you really enjoy any future hangouts with the voice in your head telling you they're just faking it? they're just bringing you along because its a chore? I wouldn't be able to live with that anymore than letting them break me down. FYI, Drew you can undeafen lmao we would like to hear your thoughts @keepcreative Welcome!

To each their own  Thats cause we broke them with the start of college stories Guys I still feel like crap and I took a Covid test to be safe. Results are pending. I thought nothing of it til my sister texted me that she was positive  It was a smaller one but thats the one. Smaller because its self. Sister: I feel so guilty and disappointed in myself for getting exposed.
Me: *who has worked in nursing homes+hospital during the pandemic and might only be exposed because of her* I wonder why It doesnt hurt but it depends on who does it. I dont mind it, I had to get it every week for my old job Theyre fools. I do them on old people and they dont even blink Its the I cant believe the government told me I have to do this cry Gym rat: idk how I can spread disease in this building?
Building: sweat, heavy breathing, machines touched by everyone Thanks everyone!  Yay! I was supposed to get vaccinated tomorrow LOL @DaHomieDrew have you watched Grown ups? Good luck and be safe! Make it another movie we have to watch! Is movie night tonight? I promise to show up this time Omg is Fae a Adam Sandler fan too  Hes a gem! mayhaps YES I will never forget when I watched Click cause it was listed as a comedy and I bawled my eyes out Even though I knew the ending Mean girls? Drew since youre the host, pick a time NO Bad energy go away! They* but yes, it was a sweet reward lmfao fuck my life Guess Fae and I will be up til 1am again Shshhdhsb The instant reaction uh... Im probably the most lucid I will be but I know Kyo cant We appreciate it. Kyo, what time works for you? You know.. after showers and dinners that you and Drew need to do lmao, Fae. Our assess wont be on til 11pm. Ill just ping You enjoy your league game yes, you go metamorph yum me finishing a box on my own I love a thick crust with a crunch also; apparently that place I asked isnt deep dish... it looks it but its a mix? Like NY/Chicago combo mhm, cant wait to try it @Belbercike do your hw I feel like I missed something lmao https://tenor.com/view/patrick-the-star-working-my-ass-out-gif-16626415 This is why he rejected you ok that woke me up so I guess Im ready for mean girls when yall are My results came back as invalid lmao. I have to re-test. Game plan: go to urgent care and get a rapid test (hopefully) to just see what they quick results say to get an idea and then go tomorrow for the actual, nasal swab test so we dont run into another invalid result. Thanks! I honestly just want to know at this point. Im staying home obvi, but Ill have to let my college/hospital know I need to quarantine and not having answers rn when talking to them is annoying. Only bright side is that before semester started, I asked them what happens if we get covid and they basically said if it happens, we quarantine and thats it. So, now they gotta keep that same attitude I keep saying its a head cold but my sister called me and told me she was positive and I was at her house prior to this. Sigh... Lu is failing at life rn My rapid says Im negative, the physician said that dont sound right LMAO He basically said that the rapid was negative but I might still be a positive, so I have to submit the other swab for more extensive results I just wanna sleep. I have a headache. why are you kidnapping my children? guess what If were doing this trip IM DRIVING yall acting like I crash everyday? Ive been driving longer all you fuckers combined This is a blatant lie Im smaller than Viv and I dont like that energy Gays cant drive. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS BEEN DRIVING FOR 10 YEARS you will sit in the back seat, eat your nuggies and LIKE IT 24. Were just built different Its the way Im sick and my sister is calling me to order and delivery KFC to her house I swear people dont let me live in peace I feel shittier. Headaches and chills today. I also cough so much I yakked Yall really just talked about everything I was inconclusive. I took a rapid and it was negative but the second swab is being sent out the physician thinks it was too early cause my symptoms are too linear and my exposure fits the timeline its whatever man; I cant go to work tomorrow so Ill be doing prof dev stuff. @kyo hw pals? Yeah, that was at urgent care. Tomorrow Ill go to my workplace to get it done and if they say Im clear, Ill take their work for it. Who gets embarrassed? Embrace yourself. Embarrassment means theres something wrong though. Nothing is wrong with any of you Who cares is you trip or if someone laughs? Its not like no one hasnt done something silly Btw this is not erasure from those who are introverted or suffer from anxiety. Obviously it isnt easy said, easy done. I just like to remind people that judgement and criticism in these situations is a reflection of others and not of yourself. Open space for everyone  I think society raise us to be a certain way. I remind the kiddos that they dont need to apologize for every little thing they do. I enjoyed sociology. I got to express my opinions and debate lol I thought aro was no sexual interest? Attraction does not have to be sexual? Oh, so I am backwards. Thanks for informing me. can aro be sex-positive but fear commitment? is that just commitment issues yay, thanks for the info fam. We don't cover these things in nursing school sadly. I try to be informed through friends and proper sources but I still get them wrong at times Hispanic culture: every time you go to a family gathering its a question on where's your man and if you're starting a family Me: *breathes*
Fam: I used to do the same thing when I was pregnant mhm toxic thinking. my family has betrayed me and caused me more harm than my friends now that we are talking about toxic shit my duty in my hispanic upbringing is to inform my kids they do not have to hug or kiss ANYBODY, especially not family, as long as they don't want. literally hated the concept since a child. sucker for wood besos as in kisses its spanish mhm men tend to suck but here I am a la straight solid. mood did he speak spanish? what is the female equivalent of himbo? dkjfhbkd so its me yikes viv does he say shawty unironically? I was gonna say lmao I get called babe but with an accent "baiii" "bayyyy" usually puerto rican its the best and worst thing you'll do 90% of all of them are momma boys mother in law from hell they'll never like you and always like the ex better YES mother in law: why don't you invite *insert ex name here* she hasn't been around for a while and if they got a sister? GAME OVER. she bestie with the ex and she will the relationship *cracks knuckles* drop the addy, don't be shy literally my main job as resident mom Me: *cuts my family off*
My family: *calls president Biden to insult me* I LOVE AITA hispanic gf crazy too a valid person, the sub's unicorn: AITA?
everyone: yes.

I was told off by my coworker to stop being a child because he left me with a entire unit of 50 beds alone to supervise while he took a break without permission and it was longer than intended. We get half an hour and he took an hour and a half He said the words you are acting like a child. Will you go tattle someone else I do appreciate that the one sexist manager of the floor took my side for the moment. He grabbed his wrist and removed it from where he tried to point in my face and then pushed him away from me. He told him you need to learn to respect those who are more qualified than you. Especially when theyre correct. Youre lucky she is professional and respects boundaries because if this was any other 18 year old, if this was MY 18 year old, youd be on the ground crying for HR. I want you to apologize and off my unit. Youll be hearing from the Director tomorrow I was told by a Brazilian how to pronounce thank you in Spanish appropriately. Sir... It was not the last time he spoke to me wrong but the second time and third time I cursed his ass out. He quit. Oh, he also was the reason a person fell and broke their hip and asked me to cover for him. I told him karma is a bitch and Im gonna go for nap time since Im a child. Lmao. I had a whole ass argument with someone because they told me Im American. I explained that I am a US citizen but not American and he told me you cant be one without the other. This man also had a green card when my dog runs downstairs to the dark, room Im in by myself and stares at the corner Not today, Satan Cat: meow...

2) Contact customer support if its something that is not on there or if its past due Check junk mail too. Sometimes its one of the other.

I know its a gut reaction but you dont need to do it when youre not in the wrong or if you dont even know what happened  Mixed messages? It was a question but do you lol Seemed like you wanted to share Very common and not at all surprising when many people here dont *know* each other. We read things based on how we picture or expect people to be saying it. Even assuming the way its said.

If youre down in the dumps and need to be talked off the ledge, who do you go to? Who do you ask for help if you need it, even minor favors because you know they can handle it or do it right? Categorize into close friends, internet friends, etc Rae is emotional, I feel. strategic would be like work friends, people who can help you in the future, maybe old classmates or professors Taskmaster I have no idea you can write on that, maybe you think that everyone you form a relationship all have the same role in your life, no matter how varying the degree is. Speak on that. I just think what purpose they serve you, as rude as that sounds. do your kyo thing and switch it around you did it with that one project Thats called not conforming Link my Twitter lmfao bye!

Just to lessen it Good luck on your shift! Eat those chicken tendies great job! Sleep lol Morning to you I am alone on a floor with 3 patients and Im going to scream. This is the not busy and worst time to be left alone! Who decided I was trustworthy?  :DeerScreamSad: My mood today Today has been a nonstop shit show I appreciate the kind words and I wish I could vent but sadly I cant talk about my day without giving pertinent information. Its hard but I either have to talk to someone here to share my frustrations or just swallow it. Here = hospital more specifically, the unit. Overall, my personal grievance is that my preceptor is so backward. She either trusts me and thinks Im great or shes distrusting and has little confidence in me. It gives me whiplash because sometimes I cover my ground to give her nothing to nitpick and then she acts like Im wasting time at the computer for no reason and the other times I just hit send on whatever I have to do and she questions me why I didnt take a second I know the common sentiment is that if someone believes in you, theyre hard on you but I think its total bullshit at times. No matter what potential you see in someone, youre not allowed to be a dick. Anyways, break time is over and back to the cool and collected Lu. Adios Hope everyone has a great day Can I live there? Hmmm, depends on my mood. If Im feeling my usual self jungle, if Im feeling like I felt today, I would take the ocean Imagine you get teleported to a certain plan based off your emotions Amazing KYO  If I dont collapse from exhaustion on Thursday, you can force me to get familiar with the server Promise.

I have officially been scheduled for my first overnight. I want to cry Who in their right mind wants to work 7p-7:30a Not ME I do 3 consecutive 12hr overnight shifts rip just look at my schedule and cry with me I did one overnight in my life, 11p-7a and I clocked out and went to the track to jog. I didnt sleep again until 3am.... This is a disaster training and internships suck, but theyre worth the experience and open up better opportunities. slippery slopes I can if someone switches with me, but its designed to be a schedule with rotation that everyone follows. I dont want to be the person who complains We appreciate it. There are some phenomenal communication between doctors and nurses on my unit and it truly feels like a team. It minimizes all our stress and ensures quality care for the patients they invite us to their rounding where they discuss the patient and goal of care and its just so helpful to know what will be done and how I can do my part to ensure it goes smoothly toxic cultures are everywhere, sadly. hope your experience improves  I am happy to hear! I will try to share more positive and amazing stories I've heard/experienced they make everything worth it Free this weekend, I decided not to do the crackhead thing Tomorrow! Do you have hw?

I would like to formally apologize to Kyo for the 200 tik toks I have not watched shfggk I will binge them on vc for live reactions Its not embarrassing. The anxiety and fear is okay, and the fact that you acknowledge it and still want to get it because you know its need is so important Thats valid too. Some people get more comfort when its someone they trust. Theyre really sweet and make it as quick and painless as it can be Its on your time too. If you need a second, theyll give it to you. Ask questions and all that The soreness kicks in a few hours later You might feel hot, maybe feverish but you can medicate before hand to lessen the effects if youd like. Anything that is horrible to withstands or prolonged should get reported My state got named the #1 snobbiest state in the US LMAO Massachusetts its known for its medical field and we all know the egos those people can have Myself included  I was getting to it LMAO no. You werent saying this last night All you had to do was be patient Haha nothing personal. Just cause they are doesnt mean youll be My wife wants to divorce me cause I didnt set up the pick up line  Yall dont go hyping her up like that Four people were talking to me! I had to pick and choose who You know what, Ill ignoring everyone now. I AM A WIFE WHAT ABOUT MY HAPINESS I was making room to give you my *undivided* attention Except you, youre not included. Look at that, I said what about my happiness and no one said a word. I see how it is, take the Italians side How dare you just forget my adoptive child Kyo smh What did you break? Oh the window punch You mean that? Theyre really good to keep I never really cared to notice heavy keychains are until my friends tossed one onto his glass table top and it shattered lmao Now I try to spread them out Sometimes its the confusing process too. Thats very kind of you It alleviates some anxiety If not most Happy to hear Kyo  Drew, dont say a word. Im proud with whatever you do that makes you happy. See this is just dumb because you didnt notice immediately 120/80 is the cuff of normal, is it at rest? are you stressed pain active if that's your resting, it's not bad. if its your active BP, well that's good. having hypertensive parents means you're gonna have higher risk of the problem yourself if you don't do the stuff you said. I wouldn't worry and change the entire life routine to maintain it steady but consideration of salt intake, greasy food, and exercise will go a long way so if the food you eat is salty, consider not adding table salt stuff like that I think stressing about this already, when you're not at the highest risk, will lead to hypertension than what your life choices are atm tbh drink a lot of water, opt to take the stairs instead of elevators when you can, maybe take a stroll in a park when you have free time, consider eating in instead of out baby steps I have to remind my patients, and myself, that most conditions are chronic and its not one decision you've made today,  but its the small ones you've made in the year I can when I try lmao haha you're sweet, I'm a nurse. I don't take the doctor creds dsfkjnggh hypothetically omg it is an e-boy how young? I had a lot of interest in medicine, I was originally pre-med track but I opted out because of financials.

I was getting ready Shot blocker as in the u shaped device you put at injection site? Ive heard of them in passing but never used it. I dont think I ever seen them used in offices/facilities Ive been at but for people who have horrible anxiety and other sensitivity we use topical anesthetics to numb the area Interesting. How effective is it for you, if you dont mind me asking I wonder if thats something you can find online in some medically approved website and ask them to use when you go? I dont know much about them but if it has lidocaine, I dont think theres any harm in my experience and from what others told me, the injection pinch isnt painful, its just the soreness that follows a couple of hours later that kills people. Feel free to medicate beforehand (if approved) and use cold pack if you find that helpful Im like semi sleeping and back read that you got it today, my bad! I hope it went well  For sure, I always remind myself to do it quick when I administer them cause no one wants to feel a needle go inside millimeter by millimeter glad it was a decent experience for you its not too bad when people are kind and understanding but youll have the occasional person causing a commotion and thats when 3 hours feels like 15.

Hit by a ransomware attack, the pipeline that delivers about 45% of all fuel to the east coast said it was forced to take systems offline to contain the threat. Colonial pipeline company is trying to restart it but because of this, prices may rise in areas the demand is also limited so people are trying to stockpile Hoarding isnt the answer and those people are idiots since theyre wasting more of the supply but being paranoid isnt wrong.

Thats just a taste thing then, its nothing about being offensive right? Hmm I guess I can see why Viv scratches her head at the idea of eating something watered down from its traditional tastes What is thoughtful though? Do you feel the same about Tex Mex? isnt that just a preference? Tex Mex in that state is how it is, everywhere else its just a con for people to eat what they think is ethnic food that appeals to their taste buds Often enough, the ethnic people themselves are smart enough to profit off this You just talk about it with such hate I thought you were talking about it in crossing lines of appropriation but you just dont like peoples food preferences  yeah I know You talk about it with every chapter babe. Thats why I asked if this has something more to do with just flavors and I got my answer Hate away the flavors Theres worst things to be btw that's a california roll that you described the avocado one? I need to google some but the biggie is california and even american's, snobs or not, will look at you if you get it and say "that's not sushi" sing to me paolo :owoCryingKiss: I'm gonna out-snob the snob I will have a good time doing it too zinger I need one night of Sushi's sleep that bitch be living SUSHI YOU GO GIRL sjndakfhbd WHAT IS HER NAME skdjnfhg Shonny  I definitely do but I was talking more about the pfp lol thank you! love you to pieces  see you on the other side love you too viv thank you! thank you kiddo Yay!

good news is that its fine and in place bad news... Lu had a cyst on her ovary and it popped oof indeed I knew something was wrong but I did not expect that I feel gross. popping? it naturally should just pop and the body absorbs the fluid it leaves I should be okay once it clears the cyst was big enough where it caused a disturbance in my body and I was symptomatic. they did an internal ultrasound and that's how they told me cause the fluid was still there with remnants of the sac I also learned that my uterus is retroverted which is hopefully not gonna give me too many problems in the future I will cry if it does. I just want to be a mom. and I love every second of it its towards my bumhole I hate it here you're so sweet firework! I appreciate that I have a friend who had a son and now is pregnant with this problem too and it went okay for her the only thing is that you can't hear the baby's heartbeat at home cause its too far back :( so I'll be paranoid until the check-ups I also just have a bad history with my body so its just me thinking of the worst I saw that @faede , and this was my response to it. I said it before the emote!  y'all I got personal drama if someone wants to sit back and hear my shitshow of a life when I finish my hw, I mean oh its not venting I just figured people will be entertained I'm just built different LMAO yay knowing stuff makes you more paranoid, it sucks my classmate announced today she's pregnant but she's so early that she thinks its a false pregnancy, as in.. empty egg I had to talk her off the ledge there's a name to it, can't think off the top of my head, but its basically a benign mass of cells that becomes the placenta without the baby because the sperm fertilized an empty egg so during ultrasound, you see active placenta without the fetus its crazy lmao *pauses* there's so many things I stopped doing or thinking of that makes me rusty until I jog my memory back with more info @kyo  13.1T??! are you serious :YellingWoman: LMAO yeah, I'll take a break a lovely month it'll be feeling empty CONGRATS TO HER!!!! I just skimmed this convo but my first reaction hearing this is strep, tonsillitis, and mono. I just woke up, cause of course things happen when Im sleeping, so let me get my brain together and Ill tell you more about them. You said you have white patches but what about red spots at the roof of your mouth? They go hand in hand with strep.
- sore throat that suddenly came on
- pain swallowing
- swollen tonsils
- fever

Tx: drink plenty of water to keep the throat lubricated, Ill leave the temp to you. Im a cold relieve person, others are warm.
- rest
- throat lozenge
- antibiotics Youll know its mono if you get diagnosed with strep throat and then see that you dont feel better with the antibiotics. Mono symptoms are whole body. Includes rash, swollen lymph nodes in the armpits, etc.
Same treatment as above. Now that Im up and moving. I have 5 assignments due today and I dont want to do any of them lol Thanks!!

Not that I think what you have is contagious but given you don't know what it is and its just better for everyone warning, some places don't care as long as there's no fever Yes, youtube videos are so clutch in the health field. I know my fair share of stuff explained well shopaholic anonymous lol I've been doing hw since 8am so I can catch up and now I'm taking a break I didn't realize its only 1pm. I swear it was 5-ish I completed one assignment, currently watching a 3hr long film so I can write my other discussion on it and then move on to the new chapter and do this all over again thank you! this is a minor course for nursing. It's world religion so the format is entirely new to me and its packed for week's at a time its stress Aw, you're all amazing. Thank you. You have re-filled me with energy I completed my two discussions board. Waiting for response to do my final discussion. Meanwhile, I gotta read 45 pages to take a test in 3 days... oh and did I mention I work tomorrow and Wednesday? rip :AP_cry: Lu is gonna go home and collapse. Let this be an advice to everyone from mami Lu. You will always take your break, maybe its earlier than you want or later than you wish, but take that damn break. Its a literal policy to take a break (and how long to take it!) depending on your hours. Are you a server, bartender, host, or busboy? Tell me what? I cant believe you felt like you had to say this Im ashamed I am disappointed facts Anyways enjoy your keyboard No I just got out the shower I am going to eat something and go to sleep. I was woken up 3x last night and had a heavy assignment today. I barely finished an hour after I was supposed to clock out white rice and some stewed chicken very Hispanic lol Its delicious and easy to make Kyo when do you work again? did you end up calling out Oh there is my answer Lit More time you spend on your fancy keyboard I havent had a good look at it, whats on it? I need thinking theyre animals at first glance but not sure youll have to type for me on vc later this week Oh I thought the one near the shift key was a shark Guess I wasnt too off Right LMAO Close enough Why?? Thank you btw! Didnt mean to ignore you @faede I skimmed earlier and noticed you said maybe like two words. Hope youre okay and I love you I love tattoos, its a surprise I only have one LOL its the energy I give off I got hella piercings Tattoo care:
1. No scratching.
2. Keep out of sunlight for the first 3-6 months. Honestly, go for as long as you can.
3. No chlorinated water for just as long.
4. Put gel on the area to help heal and keep moist to prevent irritation.
5. Touch ups are gonna happen, especially if colorful. My tat is very simplistic. I can show it but its a Capricorn zodiac sign and my fathers DOB I got it at 18 just to show him how much he meant to me, being the literally trunk of the family and I put it somewhere its just noticed if you stare or depending how I dress/wear my hair dont regret but if I waited til I was older I wouldve switched the concept some basic tattoos are the ones that mean the most. I like intricate shit for the most part but I went easy for my first. My friends went more wild and all hate theirs so I win lol I was gonna do a quarter sleeve and a thigh/hip piece and just never went through with them. I had them all drawn too honestly? I respect tf out of people who get something just cause they like it I wish I could but I gotta add meaning to it or Ill regret it My friend in Cali goes to this tattoo shop on Halloween cause they raffle off tats. The other place put the tattoo sketches into those little plastic lid cups and you put in the quarter and take one out. You get tatted the one that comes out. That shit is so cool to me. I wish I had the balls idk, I was more reckless back then. Might be years from now when I watch to switch up the look Actually scratch that, I always said Ill get a tattoo with my hubby. Not his name or a matching one, but a similar idea I like the thought of a peek-a-boo tat. I call it peek a boo, most people call it secret tats. I just mean one where it wont be seen in passing, youd have to look for it and Ill end it there unless you wanna head into NSFW lol my little Fae was typing uwu :02HeartLove: fae a baddie like their mom Im gonna take them to get their first of course my two kiddos getting tatted the same day a mothers dream the way you didnt ping me thin ice son  I have homework due tomorrow and I work tomorrow so im gonna get that squared away, then help my mother be a decent human, eat, and then Im yours. Hopefully. Not apoco without me  GO CRAZY AHHH GO STUPID AHHH GUYS HELP my friend called me yesterday when I got out of work because this guy she had a massive crush on and was friends with a celebrity (but she interacted with him various times irl and social media) ||committed suicide||. We were on the phone throughout my entire drive home, with her just sobbing.

Okay lol. Yeah I was confused by the laughing comment. Only people who werent raised like that dont laugh. Plus the story behind it was that the brothers were egging her on and thats why they were happy it connected @faede @rashon24 I watched Spiral, the side movie to Saw.  It isnt bad but it isnt great either. Less gore and police oriented. I like Chris Rock and wanted to give him a shot. This wasnt the breakout movie for him in the horror genre but I wouldnt be opposed of him trying again The dumbest thing to make me laugh was when he slammed the door in Wills face lmao. His little Ill be outside Ill be outside I watched it online. Can send you the link if you want it. Really good quality The dialogue was so bland. I was like homie do better Surprisingly the partner was interesting with barely anything that he did I know. When the bigger box was sent, I did the dreaded not him cause theres always at least one person in the saw movie that I like 4/10 I just finished it and will watch it again for you both if you want lmao hw is done I sent them the link so whenever they're ready :) rn or too soon lmao I think I can actually stay awake tonight Ayyy this bitch ..... rn means rn fool go wash that swamp ass scaddaddle drew, wanna join us?

Congratulations son! You deserve it I decided to scroll through fb and Spiral came up. The comments are basically us last night @faede The last person posted Marty too  Smooth asf This Bruins game is so intense Nail bitter we lost :( 5-4 Islanders Always tied it eh, you build tolerance I gotta be a certain type of fucked to go for gin That or trying to hold my own against others I remember I was at a pool party and they were drinking gin on rocks  Bitch was wavy Es que ta bueno  Happy birthday!! Guess who got a raise! :tlDeerDance: That squirrel got a fatty me     squirrels
       
 gettin nutty im gonna have to pay taxes this year cause of the sudden influx of income rip well, next year Im putting food on the table This is the other thing I am happy about. So close, yet so far Im so mad. The Bruins are facing elimination because they wont pull their injured goalie I hate it here. Fuck Cassidy Fuck Rask I hate it here x2 Just hockey things Yes NHL Its fun! and they do I like angry, hot guys with no teeth  https://tenor.com/view/montreal-canadiens-boston-bruins-fight-fighting-hockey-gif-16290265 My kinda game Its the way the Bruins shouldnt have lost for me Someone sign me to be their coach. Ill get the cup ohmygod Next season. You and me. All games. Ill teach you everything I just know Kyo will be a shootout fan WHAT SPORT DO YOU KNOW?! I can teach you all of them. I dont like soccer but a bitch knows what she gotta know Oh that sucks If I learn it, will you let me teach you one sport? Oh I just mean taek itself Ill enroll into a class  its good exercise and I get what I want Win-Win Ill Google some around me and youll be the judge Theres a lot of Brazilian jiu jitsu near me but I havent seen much others I agree with this for what Ive seen Haha its done! I shouldnt laugh but thats such a mood If youre this nervous is because you care and if you care than you took time to study. My fingers crossed for you! Nearly everyone passes if they all scored in the same area So the average of the class goes up LMAO you mightve hindered the curve it might still be done but you have to be close enough for it to work Changing the weight is good if you did poorly. It means it affects you less (your grade wont be as lowered) Weighed grades suck when youre doing good because it might not give you enough points to bump up I cant speak for your parents or what they would do but no child should have a breakdown because of a class. If taking some time to recover before you do other courses (or even continue with the degree), thats a conversation you need to have and soon. @faede the easiest way I can explain it is that the teacher finds the average of the grade that wont bring high scoring students grade down, but will raise low scoring students up. theres different methods to it but the common one is that they toss questions and will award those who got it wrong the points but those who did get it right wont receive extra credit Is there a way to build a schedule where its less clustered around the more difficult courses so you have more time and energy? Maybe that will help you if you dont drop the minor Obviously, do what is best for you. If you dont think the minor if worth it, by all means focus on your major. I know its not easy cause you prob need certain amount of credits in a timeframe but just throwing out suggestions thats worked for me I have dark eye bags Wow, thanks hospital.

How tall is lady Gaga? Im shorter than both of them?  Now now, the only person allowed to punt Vivs ass is Kyo We know this. a n y w a y s Viv is short and skinny and Im shorter and thick Aint never seen two pretty best friends til now shes always ready with it https://tenor.com/view/gay-twerk-gif-14013113 54 is like average for girls last I heard I remember cause I felt insulted that I was way under the norm Someone said that size 8 was the average shoe size for girls and I wanted to cry cause Im size 6-7 and thought my feet are huge Im a fucking mess . I lied in my license skdhdhsjsh @azula why are we the same?!  Yes, yes I am. My mom and dad were very upset when I registered. Theres a lot of myths that scares people from doing it. God forbid, but if I die tomorrow, I want to save lives postmortem. Its an amazing thing, really. Its because people think if youre critical, they wont save you once they realize youre a donor, which is false. We triage from severity, and if someone has no hope, we sadly wont spent time on it and move to someone else that urgently needs attention. the OH chapter with the ||mass casualty|| did really good depicting the reality of how it is in the hospital during these events. mhm, we really do just tag people and send them off to be assisted. I also watched this show called The Good Doctor, although obviously medical shows are dramatized, the last two part finale of the season was the surgeons going to Guatemala and do 12 surgeries. They had to rank everyone who showed up for who would win a spot. Its so terrible but so realistic. The whole propaganda behind it. Its a good watch Basically, they needed 12 surgeries that didnt take too much resources and were >90% success rate. If patients survived, more would go to the hospital. If they didnt, you would lose more of them because of fears. Honestly, it can be said for a lot of careers, but its all management and money. Theres stuff that happens in the hospitals that I dont agree with and act as much as bushy tailed, bright eyed MC. I dont toss my morals to the side but I do stand by the stuff I can handle. This is another common one! Those fears are quite valid, especially in the more higher crime rate areas! You shouldnt go announcing youre a donor tbh, no one knows but you, who sees your license, and the DMV/state.  Its just a little symbol on it and after that, no one else knows. I think doctors offices stopped asking too. They only ask if youre willing if youre on the list to receive transplant or if youre trying to match Insurance its a huge thing. Theres policies and procedures of how to go about things to get coverage for a patient. When I was at the nursing home and needed blood draws, I had to go through their medical history and put my only pertinent diagnosis in order for insurance to cover the labs. If I didnt, we would get billed and youd get in trouble. . Someone stop me from babbling, I just get so heated skdhdhsjsh Paying for medical insurance and then not using it really sucks cause then you lower your premium plan and then suddenly have to pay out of pocket for whatever comes up Free healthcare  pls ONE LAST THING:
If you go to the hospital, ask for your bill to be itemized. Viv thats so legit. I had a Mexican pt inform me of the healthcare fraud he committed because it hindered his discharge plans, which I was in charge of. He was scared I obviously didnt say anything and discharged him. Hope hes doing well Sometimes the villains arent the ones breaking the law but the ones who mold and bend the rules with their wealthy influence. Fuck capitalism. I havent had one as of yet, luckily. Someone needs to have insurance to come to us and if theyre having problems with that, social work and case management takes over and looks around with their connections to get them covered. Its out of my hands. Ive had patients who file their meds under a spouses name and insurance. Ive had a patient who threatened ||self-harm|| because he was homeless and didnt what to be back on the streets, and Ive had transgendered patients who you 100% dont out. Its matter of saying the right things, behaving neutrally, and just focusing on the issue at had. Recently, weve changed where patients have complete access to their online medical records and see what we document in their notes for other providers. Theres been a change in tone and words chosen to explain their stay. Its for the better tbh yeah, labs, procedure, notes, etc yeah, common stuff is moving away from medical abbreviations that they dont understand We cant say someone refused meds anymore, we have to say decline since it paints a less aggressive photos. We cant talk about someones behavior in a subjective manner, all objective I went to a baseball game two days ago, full capacity. No masks unless the specific private establishments requires it We still use masks in the hospital, but I think itll be gone by next winter State by state varies but MA is 100% back to pre-pandemic You do what you want. I still use masks when I go inside to places, dont use them when Im outside. Its weird, that first moment when you get the choice to take off the masks. Like theres no harm if you keep it on, but its weirdly emotional. I didnt cry but it just felt like another world. Walking around Boston to the game without my mask. Everyone just smiling and being drunks like before you go emo goth cutie all my masks are black. I wear black scrubs Its prob so scary for the unit to see  White girls: white masks with flowers

Keep it moving Back that arch Arch that back yooo Where are my gays who dont know math?? Represent! I literally was so ready to hear about all these things and a patient crashed lmao I ran from the break room to the code blue and now my stomach hates me I was eating a pizza  Unresponsive person, no pulse, etc Shes alive tho! Shes going to the CCU now. Im back for the drama Is your community college not American or public? love it its ||motor vehicle accidents, gang violence, and cancer|| for me. No ||suicides|| for any of my friends of alum. 5150 are so fun Oop Never admitted one but Ive had patients who were 5150. Some because they were ||self harming||, others for having a psychotic break, others for wanting to harm us People are usually scared of taking care of those types of patients but I love them. Ill take one any day come to mama lol Alive ily gj on being you Someone pls remind me to do my hw tomorrow I cant keep staying up til midnight after my shifts to submit assignments maybe during afternoon, I always start off well, I get distracted later on vroom vroom, you in me car ugh amazing. thanks. good thing about this is that Im off tomorrow is that Ill be more active lets see what mess will happen tomorrow with me around  morning Ray, hope you have a good day! It was great! Everyone was so happy that I was on my own with 4 pts and apparently I did a good job. They heard that I was on a previous floor and they were scared that I was gonna leave them soon lol. Kept asking me if Im staying on the unit cause they dont want me to leave Theyre really kind and supportive. Every time I feel like I need help, someone is there for me Its definitely one of the better places Ive work at Lmao Rashon, I love the affirmation but dont boost my ego not until I have an actual year under my belt :FoxSniffleCry: :tlHugs: Its raining and very gloomy, just want to stay in my bed all day do it, just snuggle all the cats and lay there Im mad at Bel.

Excited to see their stuff Yes, why? Hispanic culture here parents give their kids a peck on the lips. Its usually something that stops around toddler age but I am also aware of white people who continue as adults. and yeah, my friends/classmates who have kids named them creatively or just names they like Dario, Mya, Clemente (Klim for short), Kingston, Javier, etc Hes white mixed with Italian heritage I liked the name too Hes a cutie oh I forgot to respond, Ross and Monica were affectionate siblings and sometimes it was a bit borderline but opinions on it vary depending on your own upbringing My family was rarely affectionate besides standard greetings which are kiss on the cheek. So, to see others be more affectionate doesnt bother me but its something that I just see as different or sometimes even too much that seems disingenuous lol Theres also the joke that Monica had her first kiss with Ross which was accidental so it just paints a bad picture Hey Thea! welcome to the server :) MORNING FAE MORNING EVERYONE HI FIREWORK I'm doing better today, getting ready to do more hw how are you babe? go sleep some more today is a little bit more pretty but still ugly enough to take another lazy day :CB_clapclap: I am being incredibly lazy today won't play but will keep you company yay rip paying my respects lmao viv really said fuck this comb its me shaking my booty to this cause I heard it in my head I love that intro so much 'Yonce all on his mouth like liquor  me either!

Works with Harvard so I am a Harvard associate :P I got burned :( wait, sorry it wasnt at work lmao. although I did once unplug a machine in my old place and it nearly started a fire I just have bad luck my burn was because I removed something from the over and forgot what happened but someone said something to me while bumping into me so I turned around and the oven plate touched me Life hates me rn Still gonna twerk and work tho lmao Im really good at ignoring the bad until I have a mental breakdown once a year For everyone asked me how, I have a good handle in my emotions but I come from a family/culture where your problems are minuscule to others so unless Im telling someone straight up to fuck off, you dont talk about. Ive had to deal with a lot from a young age and knew it wouldnt change so I shoved it down my throat and told myself to get over it. Ive recently allowed myself to be more open and share (even if its minimizing it with jokes) but Ill have about one huge cry a year where I sulk in everything thats wrong with my life and then wipe my tears and move on. Improvement lmao. I take advantage of my worst days and just let it go wild. I lock myself in my room or in the shower and tell myself that if I wont let it out now, I wont let it out any other day. It takes time but I know when its time for it, I feel it building up, and I just take advantage of my worst days or just over exagerarte my one inconvenience and go apeshit Thanks babe, ily. Thanks everyone but Im honestly ok. Not a good coping mechanism but Im chilling Facts @FraternalGemini trust me, I felt embarrassed and dumb after the first time I did it.

Kyo needs to come back and inform me on his dads logic of having the spare key I need opinions. Newsletter came out about my residency group with our headshots (ugh, I look terrible in mine because after 12hr shift shit) but Im nervous to share on fb. Im really big on superstitions and hate for all the haters out there to push some bad luck on to me but I want to celebrate this amazing opportunity Ive been given and have been doing secretly since December. Do I post it and say fuck it or do I just hold onto the news until graduation? I love you, thank you. No one will say anything bad to my face, they know I'd fight, but I do have cousins who are jealous of me and give me bad vibes. They're always trying to upstage me and I trust in the evil eye too much Everything has been going great so far and it gives me actual stomach ache to think it gets ruined by them. I don't deserve you  thank you, Cress! okay, I posted it. :tlKisses: to all of you I know he had it. My question was the reason behind him thinking that idea cause I have a theory, but wanted you to confirm Ogurl sexy the bar next to my house has short rib grilled cheese and it sounds delicious @faede. If I eat that, will it make you happy or does it have to be an OG grilled cheese? your pfp reminds me of Loki omg And yay! It looks really good so next time I go, or have time to order out, I will. I KNEW IT I LOVE IT are you watching his show?? I havent watched it yet but Im curious excited I just found out that theres 3 boozy ice cream near where I live Score. @Brohepsi Im not treating it as if its a slur. I clearly said that you can claim it if you want but there are people that disagree with it so why not just use a term for everyone to be happy about? I also failed to add, but those who use it to claim it, have to be personally affected by it. I havent, so I wont. Those who havent, shouldnt either. ^^ my point exactly. Forcing VS enforcing. Did you know that these terms were actually invented due to the BMI scale which has continued to be shut down because of how horrible it is to the mental health of people? Its one of the main causes of body dysmorphia and eating disorders Its a work in process, but medical field is trying to move away from it. Bepa, Im happy to read of your struggles and offer emotional support but can you spoiler tag the triggering parts Thank you People self-insert, so calling a character that exist or one to be created fat when its a heavy concept to them can potentially ruin the magic You can certainly relate to NPC. And the post wasnt only about NPC, it was just more body diversity in choices for representation. anything that makes you go wow, that looks like me or a friend/loved one. Feel free to use it where others arent harmed by it. Anyways, Im gonna buy pizza cause I just rocked my exam this morning and Im in a cheery mood I still want that short rib grilled cheese I went to sleep thinking of it Curse the only delivery system pls Google it. Delish sorry, mom cant cook for you today. Shes got a ton on her plate Trying to save her grade lmao LMAO. Yes She boutta punch the air :ASDESUthanks: I have 3 more weeks left, I think.

We were talking about this at my job and apparently its uncommon that I never had one Nope I dont even know what you do with a cavity? I had to Google how they fix it lol VIV JFC Was it painful???

LMAOOO dont come for my lack of tan during the pandemic I was being a good girl  Its a joke lol. Its cause you said the lighting was helping me but the light did do gods work in that photo anyways I still got a wisdom tooth I gotta remove from my mouth THE RACHEL!!! Omg I didnt even think of that. One of the best ones yet I forgot which online magazine it was but after the friends reunion they did a whole segment on celebrities who tried and failed it Was so adorable Its my right lower.

Jack and Judy nearly made me lose it cute little seniors Burn I would lose my shit Mine dont hurt at all! Its just there but I should do something cause they said that its curving the roots of my other tooth wack maybe when I get paid vacation I was chilling in my college before class and my classmate stopped mid sentence and stared at the stairs to the library with this horrid expression. We all turned to watch this little mice just hop down the steps! It was so funny, I wish I couldve filmed it Fae you cant tell me it hurts :(( I dont like anything that has to do with mouths! I told you it was my weakness Disgusting do you not have coyotes where you live? oh shit, lactose intolerant.

Im sure I wont be too bad but I like those fb videos bro I love to laugh but I cover my mouth when I do it so idk if they think thats the way to go Theyll have to restrain me I did anesthesia when they removed molars for my braces so this might be it for me yup, sounds like the same process What was the strongest thing you got? They dont do narcotics like they used to Tylenol with codeine? gimme the percs no Im totally kidding, my mom would rob me LMAO hmmm, antibiotics with a numb mouth sounds like hell Hopefully it was small Gn ray! I forgot why but I had a patient that had to get 4 huge amoxicillin pills before her dentist appointments to prevent infections and this woman would struggle Oh you mightve gotten amoxicillin too then ugh yeah, idk when Ill finally do this Cant see my job giving me a week off to have it Ill prob have to switch hours eh, Ill deal with it when it comes down to it sadly not the only one out there lol ok I love you, hope you have a good day I gotta nap for my night shift  Am I missing out for not listening to her? she just doesnt attract any of my cares but I did live for her drama with the HSMTM kid which for what I understand is stupid. Poor Joshua. LMAO I dont know all that Hold on, Ill tell your what my friend told me So, Joshua and Olivia are in the tv show HSMTM:TS and I guess they hit it off cause they were in basically secretly dating but not really, because shes younger and hes older, they couldnt come out with it. So, they both made an agreement to wait til shes 18, with apparently Joshua promising to wait for her. Well, he didnt and got with Sabrina Carpenter. Everyone was hating on him for playing Olivia but they werent really ever official. If he did promise to wait, thats kinda fucked but maybe he did and then met someone new. Idk, but they tried cancelling the poor boy and I think thats stupid cause he did the right thing. I mean, she was a minor and he said nope, lets wait til your legal and then found himself a legal girl My friend and I just kept laughing cause they cancelled this boy for not taking advantage of a child how dare they have a moral code I just watched someone break their side view mirrors trying to back out of their parking spot and Im mortified for them Theyre super embarrassed omg I kid you not she took 5 mins to get out of the car and check it cause I was right behind her and she knows I saw it It was a nice SUV. Poor hubby is gonna have a heart attack 6 more hours to go I am gonna get an admission and that makes my total night assignment a whopping 5. I just tried taking a short nap during my break and it just made me more tired damn that was a quick ass sleep cycle It was 30mins 1hr left Im twerking Finally home hope all of my babies have a good morning and even greater day is it better for you?

Treating myself to some homophobic chicken before knocking out Biscuit sandwich Sir Are you paying? :ConfusedCat: How many minis do you get in an order? :O oh maybe you do have some points Are you fucking sorry  Bitch can you not read? Anhiros post That came out so aggressive, oops I channeled my energy for when I respond to Andra Is your family ok? @Andromeda ayo boo. Its been a while Your rapid takes hours?! Yes Whats up boo Is work still stupid? We love to see it I hate snitches There is a time and place to make sure the right thing was done and my classmate just mightve fucked everyone over because of this Yeah, no. I wish. No, our program is entirely covered by the hospital we are working at. Recently, due to local hospitals giving a raise to their nurses as a Covid incentive, our hospital decided they had to do the same to keep staff and boost morale. Our clinical guides told us we werent getting the raise because its the trade off with school being covered. It was wack but I could deal with it. Well, my supervisor told me Im still getting the raise and it came into effect on my checks. I didnt question it or brought attention to it but one of my classmates decides to be holier than thou and told the clinical advisors. Today on zoom, they asked us if we had a problem with our checks and not receiving the amount we were supposed to. I immediately knew they were scooping. So, we all stayed quiet but at the end of the zoom we all stayed on without faculty and a classmate told us that someone asked about the raises we received and now theyre gonna go through our checks and revert it or something. Im fucking pissed. I mean, it was all in class today so Im sure theyre gonna look cause we get paid Thursdays My checks went a whole $100 difference. WEEKLY. Thats $400 extra in a month.  They didnt say who but I have my suspicions. Its gonna go down in the WhatsApp vc I feel like this should be a category on Blather round- Draw your version of Luzilla vs The Snitch Good luck tomorrow!

PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU WENT FROM BEING TALLEST IN THE CLASS TO SHORTEST. my villain origin story. Someone be kind and give me a writing prompt for Islam. I appreciate the help but I need a little more substance, babe lol I have to use evidence I already did one on how U.S media portrayal of them are inaccurate One second. Ill explain I just need a thesis statement My media portrayal was leaning more towards this so I kinda dont want to repeat myself. Thank you for the suggestion   Thanks everyone!! what is the difference between lifted and lofted? I thought I wasn't lol I did the same lol ended up more confused so normal bed frames are lifted but beds with the underneath space (like a second bed) are lofted? hmmm ok def lifted. I can't stand having space under my bed. gotta clean it out every couple of months I am currently debating if I should splurge on a slightly more affordable studio or go all out and get a 1-bedroom. difference is 1 check vs 1.5-2 checks/ studio is open concept and everything is generally in that one room, 1-bedroom guarantees the bedroom is separate for privacy and it includes dining room/living room with kitchen pros and cons for both, like costs, amenities, etc I have a big family and will need the one bedroom so I can play hostess for gatherings unfortunately I can't just have ppl sit on my messy bed LOL although the Boston bachelorette in me wants to say screw that, no guests, just visitors wink wink in all seriousness, I've always had the biggest room in my houses and to now have my entire house be one room is kinda freaky Yeah, part of the moving in is me wanting to get rid of more than half of my stuff that not essential but then I'm also questioning about how vital they would be in the future whatever, I'll eventually work it out. I keep reminding myself I'll have to carry all of it so it slightly helps I do! Hes a fun little crackhead. I love him All about the gains  Yall ever wake up thinking you dont have work and then look at the schedule and realize youre on? That happened to me this morning and I havent recovered lol My schedule got tweaked and thats why they added me today.

Hunts he pulls the lever and they disappear forever :) I do Mama didnt raise a pussy Why did this give me The Lovely Bones vibe The way the girl talks, it gives me Salmon energy Ok back to reality. Bye This is the worst version Ive ever read lmao What kind of sandwich?? Now Im hungry This sounds really good! I was going to get a turkey club from the caf but then I got caught up with a patient at a procedure and missed them :( omg I did it again I thought I worked 12hrs tomorrow but I work 8hrs. Im so confused lmfao and Im not one of them? Tragic.

I might just use it tonight and see what happens true but I dont have a splitter and I couldnt do it with my fingers Ill get one tonight oh Ive done all thats stuff. Insomnia isnt a new thing for me. Ive tried tea, no hw in bed, shut off electronics to sleep, sleeping with blinds, and all that good shit only thing that helps is having a routine so my body turns on and off like clockwork You volunteering?

LOST IT. the rich dude who hated the part he was at... like the rich people gala with his ex gf? amazing too I just thought it was sooooo good ok but rank the movies 1. 2nd
2. 1st
3. 3rd stop, the 3rd one had a great concept but I think it was the worst one I loved the idea of gangs defending their ghetto community but like.... they just made it crime on crime and not what it stood for nope 1st purge oh wait you're right I keep forgetting we're at 5 now. 1. 3rd
2. 2nd
3. 1st
4. 4th I love Frank Grillo, his hotass had me in Captain America skladwjsfgh the prequel sucked. everything else was great the couple who were getting a divorce and then got stuck during the purge cause their car broke down? FUCKING WEPT. how tf you like the 2nd better? I thought you would've loved homegirl the one from Get Out. Betty Gabriel I like the rich POV more. You see how wicked and corrupt they are. that's literally the best part. knowing it but still being shocked the lady running for office wants to stop the purge cause her family were victims. she survived the attack and she's campaigning but then her security team got bought out and try to kill her and the head of security saves her ass but they run into a group of other survivors, like the convenient store owner, the lady who is a medic and helps the wounded etc I'm watching it rn lmaooooo tell me why I was like, "oh, sweet. guess we gotta do overnights on purge day" walk out when the chaos is over with the pretty sirens I loved the group in anarchy, like I said, the couple? chef kiss.

I keep separating good piles to give to Salvation Army and Savers for re-sell but then I find some stuff I cant find myself to give up Im reminding myself that itll help others more than it will help me in the closet. I have a box of heels/shoes, a bag of old formal dresses (prom+wedding), and two bags of everyday wear that I have prepared for them  The formal dresses are going to savers so they can re-sell for a low price.

I like monotone, authoritative voices. Badass :02Smirk: Ill take him idk why my job hates me but they're giving me a ton of overnight shifts and I'm not with it. I can switch with another person but its a process to do so, get it approved, and then still work around my current schedule. I'll tough it and do them but I'm just not excited to have 3 weekends in a row I'm talking to apple customer service and..... they asked me how I am, I said well and hope their day is well too. this dude goes... "I am glad to hear you are fit and healthy" sir???? fit???? lmao I am well aware it might just be a language thing but it just amused me so much. First time I've heard fit being used good health to you I think is more common, since its being discussed. like I do the usual "glad to hear you're in good health" when speaking to them too @azula next time I go to PR, remind me to send you photos/videos of my island's forgs Coquis are tiny and cute and just say their name all cute. We call them songs lol Youre fine fae lol. Frazzle dazzle over here Can you count boo Its 2 days yes quite bad youre gonna be feeling it for the rest of the months cause itll continue fire off pain responses babe especially cause when you exercise you release lactic which causes the soreness. No bueno welcome doll Stop worrying about you-know-what sldjdjsjshsb No. Doing overnight Im doing hw right now and will go to bed soon no its ok! Im watching a Ted talk and its really nice Its not related at all to my childhood traumas but it taught me I need to open myself more LMAO thanks babe. Its quite interesting ngl. Its about the dangers of a single story and how the medias narrative harms our perception of people outside of one concept instead of how multifaceted we are very eye-opening someone want to be a pal and help me with my hw? This is the prompt: Include an example from your experience or a person you know had a misunderstanding by only hearing a single cultural story. Single cultural story is basically stereotypes. 
Ex: an American meets her new African roommate and is shocked that she speaks English well. I actually came up with something. Nursing assignments make me feel uncomfortable. they ask you to be open and honest but many are hella judgemental and I know I'd get shit if I did share experiences anwyas, watch me prove that I am a flawed human and not care if this changes their perception of me :) no lmao its actual cultural competency assignments diversity of healthcare no fear, just uncomfy cause I rather have them in front of me so I can gauge their reaction don't hate me from afar, come up and close boo @Akuna Matata ily and sorry for the situation at home. I'm the queen of taking everyone under my wing and making sure they're appreciated and happy to be who they are here on this server so I welcome you with open arms. Hi its 4am and Ive only yawned twice. Mama is thriving Im working lmao Solid plan til someone mistakes me for an actual patient and tries to poke me for the 1st AM labs 2.5hrs and the next shift should be arriving I dont think food or culture is being disrespected when someone adopts the cuisine and adds their twist to it. I draw the line of naming it after the original when it leaves out crucial or main components of it, but thats the extent of my annoyance. WAIT LMAO I love that so much Tag yourself, Im Vivs burner account Nope. Were quite similar so I think thats hilarious We have things we dont agree on/see differently and Im so happy that this is how you realized were not one person Aku: *reads Vivs post and then mine*
Also Aku: is this bitch arguing with herself? now the important question is when I made you cry did you think it was me or Viv? who is the dominating person in the dual account? Its Anhiro lmao It wasnt a bad cry lol I was being a mom you know, the usual I know but which did you picture! Me or Viv. Who was the first one? omg yay lmfao sorry Viv  youre right Viv and I are like ying and yang: we balance each other out but there are times we overlap and its madness I cant wait to educate you So since a bitch is returning from her 3 day overnight stint on Wednesday. What time is the purge marathon? Imma need at least 6 hours of sleep. just so I dont have a migraine that ruins my entire day Im like 75% sure Im having an allergic reaction to a patients perfume My skin is burning, I have a rash and I want to fucking die.

I always forget it isnt necessary lol condolences to her Hi bby Youre gonna hate me but life is kicking my ass. So much shit I suddenly have to do :(( MITH U   I know we planned the entire series. Wanna break it down movie by movie so we can do it or wanna wait for all of it together? Your choice. Your choice. I can work it around my schedule I wanna make you happy Youre right.

Fuck his wife. for everyone who said what this was it. I had a heavy patient who needed a weight and his wife swore he could move.

Voluntary.

I fucking lose it every time I come across this one buck buck buck dkajefhsgdt ITS PATHETIC RIGHT LMAO strep throat has white patches on your tonsils I would be impressed if you manage to send me such high quality photo go for it lol you're def right you ever learn about someone's reddit username and go "oh I argued with them" LMFAO I just be commenting and disagreeing with ppl just Lu things :tl1StarsOrange: but I've dm'ed a handful I would feel betrayed if he said no ok jeffrey dahmer Not today, Satan. Bet Hii, how are you? I am so hungryyy omg that reminds me I have a olive garden nearby say what you want about them but their breadsticks are chef kiss I haven't tried theirs but I've tried from cheesecake factory and it was nice california kitchen was better I'm currently looking up the menu of this old dinner I went to and loved and can't find the omelette I ordered :( they changed it so its like half right and then this other item has the other correct half lmao I had two ladies try to fit me for bra sizing and they were both different lmao I know what I am but it was funny Im used to them sizing me wrong because my body is hourglass. So my boobs and hips are the widest part of me and they dont understand that. They either give me loose cups or bands and its not gonna work for me oh I wish I could at work lol Ive been tempted but the nips are bedazzled soooo Ive heard of some good brands but I dont want to do memberships to have access to them and go through all the trouble of buying and returning til I find the correct size. At least at VS if I drop $175 I walk away with them and know they fit god bless Victoria Secret always having 5 for $25 sales They some hot satin boxer briefs  METTA HAHAHAH Hanes all the way  Im crying rnnn my favorite thing was having a class full of girls being told that when you guys adjust its not to be a perv but shit gets sticky and uncomfortable fast I was dying cause like no shit He was like theres no polite way to do it. Just mind tour business HAHAHAHAHAH yeah!!! There was a buzzfeed article with just guys things and it talked about the towel trick You know the *one* And I lost my mind because I always enjoyed when I was shown it I had to pretend it was brand new info cause I didnt want to say others taught me nsfw yeah that buzzfeed article was wild. Went from goofy and cute to real sad fast it went from the towel trick to relationship problems such as women enforcing toxic masculinity or feeling like you cant approach a female and have a normal convo because they take it as flirting Per his word sometimes you want to tell the girl at the coffee shop cool shirt but cant because they take it the wrong way. I just really like your shirt I thought that was depressing they also mentioned lack of emotional care. Platonic touches, etc Id totally volunteer to do that Men need affection it truly is my favorite foreplay is cuddling on the couch and having men play with my hair catcalling is more offensive and just a way to show physical interest in someone. this is just like If you dont know them, a man wont talk to you unless he thinks youre hot Which is dumb. Think about it in school your guy friends are friend zoned. Who approaches you to flirt? The ones who arent your friends. And if youre not their standard of attraction shit goes south fast. Most girls just dont like to be approached 90% and thats cause others ruined it for them. See! Thats fucked! Its not a creep move unless youre staring at her chest the entire time I personally entertain all convos whether Im interested or not LMFAO shes me Im her baby, attention seeks me I love the ones that try to upsale you maam, I came for a purpose and thats the only reason Im here Manifesting running into anhiro and forcing him to talk to me Anytime a female speaks one word hes gonna be in here like was it u LMFAO CHANNANDELER BOND oh she thiccy Thanks is this the part where I say idk if I pronounce his name right? I only say it one way and thats the only way Ill say it Yeah I def dont actually wait Fae might be onto something Anne-hi-row?

I like it. Theres a movie similar in nature but not quite there in terms of thriller but its called Acrimony. Its basically a movie about infidelity and its soooo good I wanted to scream and cry because I felt every bit of her frustration and pain What was the last movie that made yall cry? coco for me Ive gotten more emotional over the years. I feel too much Idk who decided I should be both a bitch and an empath but its a struggle I read the book and watched the movie. It didnt make me cry but I wanted to fight everyone Shitty ass people and families If you like things like that you should read A Child Called It and The Promise of Stardust @cressidastclaire Tw for the child called it though its hard to stomach if you cant handle the themes I read both in high school. Both really good for two diff reasons Forrest Gump, A League of Their Own, Ferris Bueller.. I feel like theyre all classics that need to be watched Im for sure making my kids watch them Dont make em like they used to Omg I remember that one! It was a good read though My reading collection is like my movie likes.. all over the place I remember during the winter I took off my shoes and walked outside to get an idea of how hard that walk for him was I knew, living here my whole life, but its such a horrible feeling to know it was only worse for them the boy in the striped pajamas Rip Was that the Warsaw one? The pianist? I just googled and it is. We didnt have that one in school but my dad and I watched it The book thief was one we had for English too Doesnt compare to the others its about a young girl stealing from the mayors home library because they werent allowed libraries anymore. The war was going on and its how she was able to learn and keep sane she had a man in the basement they were hiding, and she would read to him, teaching him how to write, etc. Very nice.

I couldnt but not because I didnt want to. My sisters water boiler broke and flooded her house. They resolved the leak but didnt have hot water so she stayed at her bfs house with the kids and he lives 40 mins from the park. On a good day, I am home and showered by 8:30am and it takes me an hour and a half to drive to that park so we wouldnt have made it at the same time and I didnt want to drive. My plan was to nap during the drive but since she wasnt driving from down here it wouldnt have matched time wise. She felt bad and the kids wanted me there so we might go a diff day Hope all my East coasters stay safe and hydrated during this heat wave. Take care of yourselves and plan accordingly  Kyo, thats literally the cost of one of my nursing textbooks rip Its in effect until Monday.

I just realized this is general ugh y'all drive me WILD. All of you are wrong Its January https://tenor.com/view/michael-scott-true-gif-5644456 https://tenor.com/view/no-do-not-want-the-office-michael-scott-steve-carrell-gif-5644457 https://tenor.com/view/dont-you-dare-dont-dont-do-it-the-office-michael-scott-gif-14178027 Mine has winter break, amazing holidays, cute treats and hot yummy food. Yall being bias Im just saying it how it is :owoWink2: I just wanna know why the month with least amount of days is the worst lmao January has holidays you never dressed New Years gold apparently. Winter clothes are pretty styles and colors and food is universal but cold is cold Nope. its me Im the noob oh she hit a valve she was trying to go around it cause you won't hurt it dksfdhjgf she hit the valve and if she was smart she was not gonna bust through it so she wigglrd weak vessel are you hard to get blood? are you drinking water dehydrated hoe Ill narrate them sexy stuff. Ill make it fun Ill use my accent I decided to treat myself and sleep in a little later and missed the opportunity to work 11a-11p Those are GOLDEN hours Im pissed Thats kind Bel Youre sweet. why the uni part but youd finish everything at this one college right Thats the best option single courses in uni are typically more expensive and harder What do you mean by higher education cause it seems worded wrong rn no, I get it. Just seems a bit demeaning of CC. Higher degree is usually what is said cause thats more factual. You dont get masters at a CC. you can get a good job with an associates depending on the career and your own motivation Aside from that, I just think getting pre-req done before a private/state school is in anyones best interest. Even if not low on cash. That way you focus on your major when accepted. the way you initially said it seemed like you were applying to the uni and finishing your stuff Thats why I commented. anyways, yeah. CC top tier. Recommend it to everyone. Has everything and for cheap Private/State professors are high and mighty, have a miserable life and think all there is to life is working. CC have long, fulfilling careers and usually take this up to help others reach that potential I have the worst patient assignments and its so funny to me I love when I get the patients that people would run from cause I either get them to like me or I just page the doctor every hour how they refused care and thats all I document  One of them is mentally delayed and walked into a patients room last night and started stroking her legs. We now have him 1:1 sitter which means supervised at all times. Hes also aggressive when agitated and towers over me. Hes 62 to my 50. The other one has dementia, super combative and tries to punch you and doesnt want anything to do with this hospital. Hes also covid positive so I have to gown up and go into that room and then gown off and then do it again within minutes cause he calls and doesnt remember why or screams for help Hes old and unattractive. I wouldve been ok if he was hot and in his 30s Fingers crossed my other two patients are supposed to go home so Im just wicked busy Im off tomorrow but work Tuesday and idk what to do with myself Sure! this woman tapped on my car window asking me for a lighter. Idk what of my demeanor gives off that I smoke or possess a lighter anyways, I shared mine with her. She was ecstatic lmao I dont look like a smoker! My teeth are white, my nails are pretty, and I smell expensive. I just always have a lighter on me  Omg, never had a guy asked me but I def be there to roll up I was raised with smokers Naps, all the time, for no reason >>>> hoping for an easy 8hrs Someone recommend me food Got to leave early todayyyy Idk how you forgot, Im literally right here I am the luckiest, unluckiest bitch ever. just my fucking luck. I did more courses than my classmates cause I started ahead of them (go over-achieving Lu) and I did not realize the next two semesters (14 weeks) are courses I already did take and now I'm scrambling to find open seats for the last two requirements I need. I'm so mad, I should've caught onto this sooner but they changed the course up by switching two classes and it threw me off I hope I can make it to the ones I want since I have this free time and I can get ahead and graduate early but idk. I'm waiting for the director to look over the list I sent and have her approve it. I got approved for a fucking class and it closed. I emailed another college and hope to find something but I think its too late. My shit luck. I swapped my tongue piercing with a jewel and its pretty Balls to diamonds baby I clean it when I brush my teeth/tongue. I do change them out at least every month because bacteria can build up. It was overdue and since I had to replace my other ones, I decided to treat myself to a new one I remove all of them myself. Im not scared to fiddle around when they heal haha Do it I better have started that shit Its me, me. I thought a hornet was a type of wasp like different colors and size but essentially of the same family I will confirm that tea tree oil helps me with my bug bites. Im allergic. My body would rather cease to exist that to not be dramatic with the little blemish Hi baby, my cutie. That didnt make sense but all love and feelings I just realized I picked the worst career for pregnancy I mean, I know what to do, but like I gotta work until close to due date I hate it here bobble head baby Id have to find the info in my old documents to know what I was but I think I was 7lbs, 6oz. Viv baby, I dont know the stats of ALL the babie  I was an incubator baby My body wouldnt heat up. I was also born a month late which isnt good. I wouldnt heat up and they didnt tell my mom. They just snatched me and took me out of the room. My mom had a full blown breakdown and she reported their asses to the head Lmfao you really do and I appreciate it Although we dont have stats like that chilling in the hospital More for mom than baby. Prolonged labor due to size, probs cant be natural. Infection. Emotional/behavior problems is a biggie for babies. Stillborn/newborn death. Hypoglycemia is another biggie Along with the emotional/behavior problems, they say that post term babes are more academically gifted. New to me as well. Hm. I can look into it To this day, my body still has a problem managing my temperature. When I have a common cold, I get 104F fevers. Its crazy. Does that bring you comfort or does it upset you? if you dont mind me asking. Parents always hold their own kids to different expectations and its horrible. Like, just give us the decency we deserve. Sorry about that.  god, I really hope when I have my kids I wont lose my mind and become stupid Im gonna need everyone to help me raise some great allies people are gonna have weekly posts on here of how I should talk to my kids about so and so. Gonna need the feedback Youre gonna have to find a damn good doctor who wouldnt argue against it. Theres so many good and bad things that come from it. Its benefit vs risk. it really isnt a universal answer. Each kid is unique I menstruated at 9 years old. So imagine I had to wait almost 10 years to make medical decisions as to what gender made me comfortable? Fuck that. Yup! Thats one of the cons! I didnt know about the colon tho Wow. :O Interesting I applaud the doctor who thought of it Digestive organ From the large bowel Removed water, nutrients and all that stuff LSJDSJSJSHNS@VIV shaving cheekbones scare me@ and jawlines too Testosterone when did you start using a binder? ngl I feel like the first thought people would have finding one is that its a waist trainer if I can ask, do you have a plan of when/where it will be done. Money aside? It seems your parents arent the most supportive and surgery is no joke. Youll need a lot of aftercare. I dont want to upset you with any question so Ill always ask before one. Im like blunt formal when I dont know the boundaries lol Its not a bum thing to live with parents. Its smart, despite how emotional and psychologically damaging it can be at times Financial security is hard. Take your time, do what you must but stay safe. parents kicking out kids at 18 boggles my mind. Hispanics would never. We usually leave cause we are sick of not having autonomy Ive paid rent and covered all expenses ads since I was 17. It sucks but hey, Im paying to live here so suck on that. word of advice for everyone, have your name on the lease. It sucks financially, but it gives you full reign on the place youre staying. Unless managed by offices and governments but you know what I mean as he takes away yours The audacity My dad is the I dont mind gays, but my kids cant be gay lmao. He lucked out cause were all straight but I know for sure hed be the type to send us to therapy Can I weigh in as a cis? I thought it was mtf Mhm Okay, my opinion!

When you get romantically involved with someone, youre hoping to get to know them. All of them. Without deceit. I understand its harmful and scary because of the phobes and recent increase in aggression that leads to their ||murder||. Its not easy and I dont even think to claim it is easy but its not well to hold part of you a secret when it surely can affect anothers perception of you because it may be a big deal to some. Whether its the hiding or the truth.  Some people just dont fly that way and thats their problem, but they deserve to know. I usually relate it, although its not the exact same situation, to informing your partners about STI. Its not easy, you may be ridiculed and people have been beaten to ||death|| because of this. You still have to inform them because they consented to being with you, but that wasnt on the list of consent. So yeah, you need to know everything to consent. I dont think its the first thing you should tell them. Take some time, feel them out. Hopefully by then youre close to or starting a relationship and you know their character. You feel safe with them. And know their viewpoints. Thats when I think you should do it Cause lets be honest, if youre 8 months into a relationship but you learned that theyre not receptive to the possibility or they are not who you think they are. Break up. Leave and dont say a word to save yourself and end it all there. Nope. All before. I would be absolutely gutted if I found out my husband had kept that secret from me. I would be ashamed he didnt trust me, but still had the balls to marry me. Furious that he didnt have the decency to tell me in all the time we were together. Maybe it makes me a shitty person, but you cant keep someone in the dark for so long. See, idk. I would hope with the topics of children and what not, there would be some openness despite the stealth trans? Like what would you do if they want a kid and you know you cant give them that? It would be shitty to lie to them. Thats just unnecessary but you want to keep that side a secret and move on from your transition date Damn, idk. I dont want to be in this situation. On any side of it. Mhm True. But thats a whole other convo cause many want biological kids Personally? I am a mom. I dont have my own kids, but I treat everyone as my own. Helped my nieces and nephews as my own. But I didnt put my blood, sweat and tears into creating them. Truly raising them from the beginning. I want to make the decision to have a baby, have them born from me. Have them be a little mini me and their father because its just my idea of a symbolism of our happy union and decision to make our family bigger I love adoption. I love fostering. I would do that if I cant have my own bio kids. Its always a choice but my first choice is my bio. I wouldnt have a problem connecting to my adopted child, but their very essence isnt me. They arent from my gene pool, they dont have these intrinsic things to them that is me. Its hard to define. Its hard to explain. Idk. Since I was child I played mommy, I played house. To think this one goal in my life wouldnt be achieved is devastating. And yes, I know that I would have to change my mentality on that and know deep down that I would still be a mom and play house with my adoptive/foster kids but its just a bit different. but thats just me. Thanks Rae I typed a whole paragraph on the medical aspects of it and deleted it. But nice to know you understood that end of it Nature vs nurture is one of my favorite debates. My friend and I got into a heated argument because we are both crime junkies and talked about serial killers Yes!! I remember there was this hot debate in my family because of a docu on twins usually having the same sexual orientation. We had a whole argument of the logistics of it Family nights are fun There is no right answer. There will always be a fact that just tips the scale Yes, they want to rule out all possible factors The more identical, the less variations and all that jazz I havent updated myself on all the reads but I dont think its out the question but no actual evidence has been found at this time. murder gene sjsjsjskshs IS IT? I was thinking of this mini series with Chris Evans. Defending Jacob! Its basically a father who is a lawyer and his son is being charged for the murder of his classmate. Its good but it didnt go too deep into it. His father (the sons grandfather) murdered a neighbor once. So murder gene comes up in the trial I dont think its a coincidence, but its portrayed as it is. Like, most serial killers mention some other serial killer as their inspiration. Whether the crime, the target, or execution. So if they were born in the same month as one, theyd be like, oh, I can be the new them. but yeah, the whole horoscope thing isnt for me. Im sure some of it has a sliver of truth but its just for fun when I talk about it. I dont put my trust into it I havent heard of this Can I take it online or do I got to pay? Whats the difference This is me saying empirically went right over my head  Hope. You can feel it, you can will it or lose it, but its not measurable. No real way you can understand til you go through it it ranges from you to me to others what is the question itself though. Share it Scroll up Lu is going to dye her hair.

Scars are just repeatedly to the point it just actually scars  ily Im fingers. The tools are so harsh I rather use the proper squeeze than titanium tools Oh she fancy Aku got strong ass fingers its awesome I like things getting popped how do you let it get to that point Ingrown hair pops?

Use a document youre staring at the screen anyways if you look down, to the side, use your hands, etc I know so many cheating hacks for in the classroom its just an app Webcams you see, my teachers never did that. We can have phones out and on the desk. Using it was something else I appreciate the teachers I had who respected us and treated us like adults, even as teenagers if you exploit, jokes on you though. they had the mentality of, if you want to cheat, you will, so go and do it and see how it effects you. @faede you wouldve thrived in my schools.

I used to look up some crazy stuff on the internet on how to do it and practiced but its not good if youre anxious btw.

You lay in bed and pretend to sleep. Your body will send messages to check if youre aware- an itch you want to scratch, a weird pressure you feel that makes you want to switch positions. You ignore them and your body now thinks youre sleeping and you have free reign to do stuff problem is, the brain is mighty strong and has a lot of things stored in there. Its paranoia central I had lucid nightmares as a result. Trippy to know from start to finish how it progressed but forgetting when you went to sleep in the middle of it Ever watch nightmare on elm street? Its like that oh thats a neat idea You learn its a nightmare afterwards but in the real time it all feels very real. Looking back at it, I remember there was little inconsistencies in that dream state that shouldve alerted me For sure. Deep sleep dreams Noooo, I missed Angela :( Omg babeeee.

My hospital offers reimbursement for memberships and I need suggestions I usually like to do abs, butt, thigh machines + weights and Zumba/Yoga/Pilates classes as long as they have A LOT of machine I can make do Is it 24hrs? I forgot to add that in cause of my random work hours yikes on bikes I just hated being surrounded by people. If I could rent out a gym every time wanted to go I would. Dont like people near me, dont like being ogled, just want to lose myself in the music and exhaust myself to the point my bones were liquid Plus, Im at an all time high in weight so thats the reason to start going again. Stupid metabolism I live in a one bedroom unit. No place for machine and the ones beneath me wouldnt like the thumps I have a gym mat which Ive been doing some easy stuff at home with but that was before the move. Gotta buy weights Love talking about being fat and then eating junk tho Yes lmao  is that the mirror thing interesting, I like it. Including you? Congrats I was always the one ahead of the announcements in my classes Id get a text at 3am asking me if we had class every time  what is the reason behind the cancellation? Nice. You work tonight? You know what that means.. mc time if kyo has done all his hw  so motivated so early in the day Cause theyre due tonight I guess that works too How is that course going? lol Yay! See, I knew youd do well :( :) Dura matters  wanna try that sentence again? there we go Ducktore LMAO kyo is gonna be my tech I love this for Lu I spoke it I dont like that answer:( YES my friend sent me that She went:  I said:  Kyo lets get back to the fortitude thing why I am Im just built different no I def been told fucked up things about my patients and Ive just not spoken it to others not the best way to handle it but sometimes you feel for them nah we gossip too much for that one of my patients told me that his son who lived here asked him to leave Florida cause he missed him. He flew him out and then tried to take his money. They fought and broke the family up so then he did what he could do he put him in my nursing home and stole all the money. He said if he had one chance to leave here and get back home, hed shoot him with his gun. He tried leaving 7x I would have to lock the unit. bro nah. I worked night shifts, youre short staffed and homie was hot wheeling his wheelchair to the exit I would barely get work done. Stressed. and thats just tame crap compared to the family dispute over actual death The rehab I did one of my rotations was being sued cause a patient fell down the stairs Doesnt work like that Psych is wild! Everyone in the health field has to do a psych tour to understand the important behind identifying patients They are all mingling in the same room. All mixed together and you dont know them Im looking for sally and Virgin Mary over here claiming to be her STRESS you gotta lock up the hand sanitizer dispenser cause they try to drink it gotta leave the room and secure the door cause if you dont those mofos will follow and corner you yup. They stare at the codes and recite them Cant tell me the year is 2021 but they know the 2783462 code good idea lmao listen, Ive had a patient who was soaking wet and with poop on their hands try to fight me. I literally backed up and said fuck that Patient: DONT TOUCH ME.
Me: trust me, not even accidentally nah, some things you just gotta deal with its sad but Ive risked my personal health too many time cause I care care a lil too much. It wrecks you You cant save them all. Cant help them all. You gotta deal with it. Do what you can and send them out. and its 1% of what they actually need.  kyo dont make me tell you my code story It was while you were gone. shit hurt. I did everything I could to save him. We did. His family reversed his code status to DNR/DNI. I wanted to fight them. do not resuscitate Do not intubate If he crashed again, they wanted him to pass away naturally 45 minutes. We spent 45 minutes stabilizing him at 4 in the fucking morning only to have the family say nah, let him die and he passed away in the ICU unit 10 mins later. I felt so disrespected and offended. It wasnt even personal but I just brought back your dad and this is what you decide? Im mad all over again. Id like to think it was more emotional His daughter made the call. She told us before if anything were to happen, to not call the mom but herself. So that is who decided it. It felt wrong. The wife shouldve done it. exactly. My only argument to that is make the decision before it comes down to it. The minute we got him back and she reversed it? There was nothing else we couldve done for him. Just hope his body took over It was the wrong time for it. They had a discussion that same day about it and she didnt overturn it until after he was also leaving that morning. He was going to do one last thing and get sent home. So I remind myself of two things:
1. We saved him. He was stable when he left my floor.
2. We saved his family the heartache of collapsing at home. anyways, filed that in the back of my mind, compartmentalize and went back to caring for my other 5 patients and then return that night for another shift since it was my 2/4 just nurse things. Thats the bad part, it cant or youll be distracted and then something else can go wrong mhm I allowed myself 10 seconds. I went to the break room, angrily cried, washed my face, and went back out like nothing happened. Thats fucking insane and so wrong but thats how we function. My coworkers were wonderful though. I packed up the room and he decided to save me the trip upstairs to turn it into the family, the other one asked to take my pager so I can go outside and walk it off in the cold air, and the other two talked to me about their first code stories to make me feel better. The first time is the hardest. you saved him, you got us in there and we got him back. Everything else was out of your hands and thats what I kept hearing in my head when I went to sleep that morning. Cause I needed the reminder. So wack. The doctor didnt take me serious whe I paged him before about the patient. He said he would speak to the team and see if they want to do something. It happened because he was going home and they thought I was looking for problems. Anything I would report, would tack on more days to keep him in the room. And thats why healthcare in America sucks. 11pm: pt has anxiety attack.
11:03pm: I paged the doctor about it, symptoms and what Im doing.
2:20am: pt has another anxiety attack.
2:25am: page the doctor a second time to report all the same information and for him to call me.
3:30am: dr calls and tells me hell speak to the team. I remind him this is the third in 24hrs, he tells me he didnt hear about the one in the morning. Questions me despite me informing him. Ends call.
3:55am: pt goes into vtach.
3:58am: pages the doctor that patient went into arrhythmia, no symptoms, tells him everything I did and ask what he wants. No answer.
4:15 pt codes. funny thing is, we have an overhead system for codes. We call them, and they report the code for us. I was so beyond fucking pissed that I told someone to call the code, I paged the doctor directly. My message was: pt vfibed, calling code blue. He was up in the unit within 3 minutes. Even before the overhead got called. Thats how you know he fucked up disregarding me. kyo learn your teles Red and blue are the same. But for abduction, aggression, and threats all change for what I recal l but I meant tele as in telemetry ekg learn the rhythms lmao. At least the bad ones!

group: proceeds to wreck the room please drop Kevins face. Thank you. its a mix of being dumb and overthinking I havent done an escape room before but I feel like I wouldnt know how to go about it lol Id def thing the stuff is more planned out than they are ACTUALLY WAIT I did one in my college. It was fun. wtf How close were you to the end? lmao You just walk out? bang bang Oh, I got the notif for this but couldnt find the channel Oops gl kyo I am so mad. In my dream I put on an alarm so when I heard mine this morning, I thought it was the dream one. So disappointed Guess who decided to help out and switched from 8hrs to 12hrs  they were wickedly short staffed Lmao Hm? Gimme a summary cause Im on break I just wanna say yall chose the right day for this foolishness cause my ass wouldve never. not Adrian lol Metta gonna show up its 9 in California lol :CharmanderHi: The amount of serotonin that I get from seeing this emote is quite amazing Its a good one. Kills me every time you use it I just picture you so satisfied too :samwtf: This the one for me bro looks puzzled asf Sam: yall hear that? Harsh You gonna take that Drew? you should fight for love! Defend it! Or whenever that dude from RoE said before ripping off his shirt Yes! Him lmao He was such a Latin cliche but I loved everything about him the scene at the club for the bachelorette party always sends me sksjsjsjshs I saw that Rude asf   This has going to be controversial But since Abyss isnt here right now imma share.. Ive never watched Megamind. Anyways, goodnight  *sleeping* :nyanbearhug2: My nephew got into his first high school fight. Proud auntie rn Everyone should get into one fist fight. Truly. Yes, my nephew won. He also didn't get suspended. He socked the kid in the jaw. The fight wasn't even his lmaoo we got celebratory burger king I boost this server boo the day they want me to be staff over there, I'll boost them. tit for tat For myself? Yes. always. yup the minute you said this I got pinged by two other people in a diff server lmao it has begun nah, he got extra fries instead. still a king cause its just a headwear Scratch all of that. My nephew and the school fucked up big time. I wanna snatch that burger king back. excuse me, movie time. I shall explain after the pixelkim hit differently though shits really good Aku did an amazing job. my gaming server has the grinch with a christmas hat so it covers half of the seasons lol quite nice right hold on wait hold on more stories are happening lol shit is wild rn you said take your time and that is the wrong thing to say to me since I'm busy 24/ 7 anyways My sister was informed of the fight through a teacher and not the Dean of Discipline, Vice Principal, or Principal. Strike 1. My sister works at a middle school a bit of ways from there and she can't be reached by cell phone d/t wifi issues so she told my nephew to have faculty call her office so they can reach her. The school apparently tried once and didn't reach here so they didn't bother to try again. Strike 2. My nephew, the dumbass, said it was ok to leave with the best friend's mom since she was already there so they released him to her. Strike 3. You DO NOT release the student to a person other than emergency contact (me) if their parents are not able to be reached. Wtf. That is quite negligent and anything could've happened to him when he left the premises. ALSO, most fights don't even end after being disciplined at school. The minute you go outside, its on sight again so what if the kids had a vendetta and actually tried to attack with a weapon? Faculty fucked this up all around. Plus, my nephew was trying to text his mom throughout the entire thing when she works with special needs kids and tried to hold a convo through shitty wifi which put her classroom in a pickle and she could've been fired for not paying them any attention since she was trying to resolve this since no one in the office informed her from a call. so either his school lied or hers lied, but we gonna find out tomorrow the last thing that is the fucking kicker is that my nephew was in this fight because the kid had a problem with his friend who goes to another school and assumed he was involved anyways so when he was in the office, they asked him to call his friend to confirm he was not involvd. HIS FRIEND IS IN ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL AND THIS WAS IN THE MORNING. like how you gonna ask a student to call another student to get a story straight and not think he was going to get in trouble for just having a whole convo on the phone ????????? it was a whole mess trying to get all the pieces flowing apparently idiots run this school @faede I like the name thing you got going night And @kylie davis welcome to the server! MY FUCKING PATIENT KNOCKED OVER A CUP OF COFFEE AND BURNED MY HAND Its so bad, they told me if it blisters and pops I cant come to work. Bro, he really screwed me over. Wrote a whole incident report and everything. It was an accident but the guy is confused and was upset I woke him up for meal and told me he was going to punch me in the face A series of unfortunate events Its the way I refrained from punching him Its not even cause I was upset but I jerked back so fast when I felt the burn I almost upper cut him Its the middle finger that got the worst of it Couldnt have been a useless finger but nooooo had to be the main one that flexes with each movement Awesome! Whats the story Or theme I guess is a better word Fat mood lol dont be upset, I dont work today and I dont feel well. Aku, dm me if youre really concerned so I can ask questions privately to help I was going to say its more than likely a blood vessel from stress/lack of sleep/straining but just in case I wouldve asked for a photo to make sure. Take it easy Im okay, I just think Im coming down with a cold. Yeah, that kind of straining/pressure is not ok. Do you hold them in? Im guilty of that and I remind myself to stop Maybe youre just aggressive lmao Control your power You might pop something else idk what that is a reference of but its funny my mom this and the sound is gross. I feel like an ass cause I get she needs to get out but its such an ugly sound Sneeze is ok as long as your mouth is covered but its the sound of the phlegm being loosened up and hacked up for me again, its not like Im grossed out but I just dont want to hear it she does this weird jaw thing noise when she pops her ears Shes a frickin circus freak idk I dont go breaking down the logistics of it lol Its something shes always done I would if my body can handle it Some people look amazing at 95. They can add a few more years with grandkidds Ive worked at a nursing home and a lady was 98 walking with a rolling walker up an down the street Her undoing was a fall that broke her hip. Very common. People have this weird thing with thinking the older you are the more useless you and your body are. Treat your body right, take care of it, and win the genetic lottery. it is what you make it I plan to battle life til I lose Update: my finger is starting to blister. Yikes. I need it to stay bubbly to heal my finger but I also dont want it to pop cause then I cant work. Too high risk of an infection. Sterile gaze and tape but I have neither. I tried yesterday but it was burning too intensely for me to try it then. Ill buy some later and see how Ill managed with my middle finger mimicking a mummy Ill check it out but it seems like itll land halfway on top of one of my blisters :/ Thanks for the tip! I forgot to read it Was it on this channel? You da best! Sounds like a movie Which is Oh thats the hostel one. Wait how many themes do you run at a time? Or when do you decide to switch? is it depending on what you book? you = customer Makes sense I think Im going to give squid game a shot I dont like hyped up things but the plot seems cool I would watch it in a movie so why not Mhm. Although after I watch Ill properly rank it compared to those I expect it to higher than truth or dare but less that escape room lol Lit. Main actor or background? Hope they were nice. Lmao amazing Thats one thing I can say about the actors from here. Usually all kind and humble I didnt get IDed when I bought my cigs. Im upset lmao I always get IDed. I look younger than my age Drew Andra nooooo wdym I know??? You dont unless youd understood why I like to be asked See thats the energy I want Ive been asked to confirm my age while they held it before Do the math homie I love having a tall wife lmao Taller than me by a lot 5 LMAO Yes My love language is Andra asking me my height every other month Next time Im going to lie Thats no milf, thats a yeti Yes For a man? 64 Anything above 6 is ok For a woman Lmao I dont want to be tall They can keep all the inches Im content being my size. General question: am I weird for thinking its weird that my coworkers followed me on IG without asking? Its not that it bothers me, cause I like having followers (especially when I used to post a lot) but like most of them are just cool people but I havent hung out with or anything. Two of them are ones Ive made plans to hangout and the closest to what I would call friends but the others are just coworkers. Like usually when someone follows another, you mention to follow you or like you post pics and tag and follow or something. I feel flattered, like yay, Im a newbie and they like me enough to want to see what I post. Thats such a plus but I totally dont get why they do this when Im outside of work too. I will get requested at like 2am or right after I leave work and maybe its me being paranoid, but why were you thinking of me at that time? See, I have former teachers/friends/coworkers. I dont find it a problem that they followed me, like I said, I will add just about anyone that I know if they request me. Its just doing it with minimal interactions which I find off I guess I can relate to if old classmates followed me, I usually say yea cause we interacted for 4 years or what not but Ive been working with them for no more than 5 months  Honestly? Now that you said that and read what I sent, I think Im just being weird. Maybe I just think that people care that much about who they follow and they prob dont. My profile is public, so I appreciate the follow since they could just see my stuff and talk about me if they wanted to Kyo knows this very well since he Twitter stalks me  hm, its just me I guess. Nah, like I said, I dont mind the actual follow. Its just, if I worked 36hrs with you back to back, why did you follow me when Im home sleeping? Lol. We all have our phones out whenever we are sitting down to catch a second it is to me. that's 5in taller than me! I'm not calling her a giant but she's average size congratulations lol a lot of people are fortunately/unfortunately I had to present and give a tour to middle schoolers who were taller than me its funny too, my growth spurt was sudden cause I menstruated early so I was taller and more developed everyone in elementary-middle school and then I just stopped. now I'm a squirt Metta is shorter than me ........ on his knees. lol gotcha idk who you believe would be 5'9 in this server besides me with my big mouth expose yourseelf rn metta's mom is a tall queen omg I'm invited to the BBQ amazing, I'll bring the jungle juice fae is obvs my +1 LMAO dance eat compliment the food bring something say hello to everyone have seconds amen Metta and I are cousins Caribbean homies :ChillBar_noted: YES damn we really do live the same life this is new, got a pic? mhm oh ok never had it but I love beer so bring it on now I'm worried Fae would lie about my cooking omg aku pls come to the states we will host one am I sugar mom now? girly, there's no rush. you can earn it lmao mine expired don't let it expire I know.

Theres so many child games out there and they wont get old as youll have new people and twist. Give me more Never enough gore and violence out there. I agree though. Show is overrated but a good way to pass the time so give me 10 more seasons. Do these mofos shower? God, theyre musty asf Finished Squid Game. Nothing about the ending surprised me. Kinda hate being right about what would transpire since Im used to the set up of these things I like the coma one, sounds interesting Reminds me of this show Ive been meaning to watch- Manifest flight goes missing for some years, when it returns everyone on the flight think its been hours and when they land, everyone around them aged and moved on thinking they were all gone Lol sure thing Problem is, I only like to binge shows so I need to jam pack all that today and tomorrow  Had my phone since it released so not too shabby Isnt yours like 4 years old?

Good vibes all around If thats true; then when he responds stop calling me old man, you look older than me what is he actually saying? I knew she was being cute. Her facial expressions gave me life She and I would be great friends Its her world, were just living in it. I watched a few press tours theyve done post release to generate more hype and half the comments are about how shes such a classy, formal lady when she speaks but her character is batshit crazy  Its acting jfc SHIT WAS HUGE my favorite thing is when old man finds it before they do their thing  He really smoked some too Oh I know him! Didnt know that was his name hes hot The Punisher  LOL! I dont watch the show but my friend has told me enough for this to land I love that aku did those emotes for rep but I literally get a flashback to the time when I fucked up in skribbl.io  sends me every fucking time SDHSHSKSK I was genuinely so confused. God bless yall patience Even Shonny was with it lmao @DaHomieDrew so how were my biscuits?

Thank you babe  and all the haunted houses :ASbigBrain: knowledge uploaded Ive taken screenshots of quizzes on canvas and it never said anything to me not saying to trust that but thats my experience if its log, I got lucky that my teacher didnt catch my friends and I or they just didnt know about it themselves which if its being used, you have to give permission so I assume everyone is greenlit to cheat awesome oh Ive filtered through tabs before too Jfc new windows and all professor: what did you switch to?

I was eating before this So technically Im extending my break in the car lol season pass holder so I technically can step out. Ill make an excuse if they ask LMAO bet vc? :CB_smart: Im home. I survived. Thank you! It was certainly a good way to relax Morning Ray, how are you? you need to charge your stuff better yes. I said so. oh damn Replace them? Weiss omg honestly cant judge tbh If I want to go to a World Series game, Id drop just as much so Thats what I do too Wont miss out on stuff just cause its pricey. Spend it now and take it easy later Hello :) He does. I have insomnia and 5hrs is what I get on a good day. Thats not the problem though cause my body is accustomed to it and I dont have any *current* bad effects of it. Ray, panic isnt an excuse to not sleep. If you physically cannot do it, you need to speak to a doctor and prob start some meds. but thats up to their decision. def shouldnt be too amped up to sleep Fine, not sleep an adequate amount, uninterrupted. Napping isnt enough. Totaling sleep isnt the same as getting the full worth uninterrupted sometimes the body just gives you signs its not doing well. that can also be related to diet Doctors can tell you more since they have your complete medical history Diet doesnt mean like an actual diet where you eat different but what your normal nutrition looks like Also hydrate. ugh I woke up with the sniffles Damn you weather Can anyone recommend Apple Arcade games? Ill take it! Woo I feel like getting a perfect score is so sketchy I would investigate a perfect score over an A+ but next time Ill get you it! what is it? VN? Omg theyre cute It feeds into my wedding dash/dinner dash/delicious game ? What does it look like, I figured a diff white like eggshell vs cream or something LMAO I like it though never changing my white Im removing the emoji too its just your conscious speaking now debating thats sexy Ill take it. I think full I did see that option! the weather is absolutely beautiful today omg I want to take a jog Have hw first but Ill visit the park and exercise Im losing my mind rn I went to a piercing store cause I need some stuff replaced while I was scanning the shelf, the worker comes over and asks me if I need help. I said no, but give me time to eyeball my size and he asks if he can size me I told him that the piercing isnt anywhere he can look at rn and he went SUPER red. I felt so bad but like, I think I got this kid. I appreciate wanting to help its not the first one everyone jumps to, thats for sure. LMAO Yup. That phrasing is the one It automatically kicks in my flirt mode WHERE :RipDead: I feel my own nail pulsing correct. short I wanted to buy a sweater and vest from my hospital so I didnt have to wear top scrubs SHIT COST $300 Ouch indeed! but now I dont have to spend more money in pretty scrub tops Less effort in the morning, more comfy at work Witness MC cheap pair of scrubs  I can express mail my pretty ones  exactly nothing screams low budget like owning it all got the makeup too can someone share with me the difference between a kindle and a nook? I want to start reading more books but I wonder if I should stick to traditional books or use these fancy ebooks seems like ebooks are cheaper but wondering if theyre pro tips for this I totally forgot kindle was linked with Amazon. I have prime so that probs gives me the most benefits Thanks! I do love the to actually hold a book but theyre so expensive. Tired of visiting multiple libraries to find the one I want Update: Im spending another chunk of cash on memberships to read. I hate adulting. mhm. Its why I used textbooks in nursing. Also chewing while studying helps if you chew during tests Im not that extreme but if I see the word Ill remember or my thought when I first read it Oh I totally remember! Ill picture the paragraph, header and all. Or Ill be like ugh, its that damn little side section of the main paragraph I skimmed lmao I hate when its the later, cause I be pissed knowing I shouldve read it and didnt. But I totally picture the entire page :) @kyo squid game on Roblox  I only know the hex one it doesnt have MY LIFE fake news theres this little cutie doctor on my floor named Preston boy, if he wasnt married. He looks 19. Preppy asf. I always catch him hiding from the attending in the back room solarium I walk in to clean up for my patients and hes just there in the dark LOL. Preston is a hot name. it was 2pm and he was over it  its like a daily thing now Pretty sure hes no older than 28. I havent formally asked hes a little shy thing whenever I ask for a favor and Im straight forward, he blushes or smiles and tells me right on it cause he doesnt want to upset me Obviously the attending gives no fucks and tells him he needs to talk to me even if hes scared LMAO Im friendly enough though! I promise. He comes to me to ask who the other people are cause he recognizes me. this other dude, who was married with a baby on the way, called me by my name (trust me, this is a big deal) and told me he likes when I sit across from him during the morning meetings cause he stares straight at me when hes thinking and I dont get weird about it  the girls are always kinda bitchy though. a handful I actually like He just appreciates my rbf lol Im about to punch a classmate in the face. shes just being a whiny bitch about this project we have to do and its beyond frustrating she pulled the well agree to disagree card you know shes wrong. Update: I tried to play it cool with the classmate after and respond to her messages like a good friend and she is acting different See, petty me wouldnt have this problem. People just like to bring out the bitch in me. You said here and I know these two thought you had a hidden friend in the server lmao I got the sniffles hot water on the belly is my cramps remedy nice to know it works for indigestion too I just love warmth its been non-stop storming rain over here and Im over it What time?

Is it 1215 creds? I always mixed and match for my mental health lmao humanities with a core two cores were hell KYO That chem lab to 10pm is gonna fuck you up so bad Youre gonna be in school all fucking day theyre all person class? or are some remote? :CH_bruh: asynchronous is good honestly, dropping Japanese isnt enough. Youre gonna have to do some heavy considerations of times/dates or just say goodbye to stability remind me, are these classes to meet a requirement for your medical program? yeah, but programs have pre-reqs to get accepted. Is this what those stems are at least, the ones here do oh. wtf so, do you get an associates and BSN? Wtf is this Im confused. okay, Im lost. It can be me Im tired See, for me.
Pre-reqs for acceptance to RN program: chemistry, biology, A&P, microbiology, Stats, English and computer science.
Side humanities for graduation- psychology, spanish, human and growth. Side stuff was for graduation and I couldve done for whenever. Acceptance onces are obviously the ones I needed to apply for the program and be accepted. Im missing something but I cant name it and then once I was in the program, I did all core classes and another two humanities. Spanish 2 and whatever other fun thing I did that I cant remember You got this Kyo! Im no stranger to school-related mental breakdowns in the car vc anytime you want my company for it slsjdbdjdjdbd My bestie got my through them. she would be at work renting out hardware and machinery to men and I would just be sobbing on the phone her: Im scared, youre not a crier.
me: I know Im such a fucking pussy!!! I hate this place!!!! Im queen at wiping my face, taking a deep breath and then acting like I wasnt in shambles. fake it til you make it :tlarBunnyCheerButt: Cheers for kyo two different students told me that once I go to NP school I cant work so guess who is saving all her money now :ASGrabbyHands: it hurts next year we are going weekly to biweekly Im mad take your time better to plan and be satisfied than rushed and hate it what doors are open for PhD that youd want? mood Thats what I always ask myself when I think of a new degree lol do I really need this or do I think its cool if I had the title Im a whole ass nurse and not satisfied. I be asking myself why not just jump onto the med track  I hate me. Would you like private practice? Flexible hours, more money, and dedicated patients sound like a score to be. Me* Money and length of school is what kills is there any jobs that would cover those kind career progressions? like, NP school I plan to have my job cover it. Or else I prob I would wait on it. my current BSN is being financially covered so it was a steal let this be a lesson to everyone: Im a broke bitch who has paid less than 5k in total for her associates and bachelors because Ive exhausted all financial support programs. At first I was embarrassed, but then I realized fuck the government. :) The cash I spent was to take a summer course to meet a deadline faster than needed and some textbooks which I bought elsewhere Hmmmm Drive safe life is complicated. talking about school exhausts me yeah, my cousin applied and flunked out of two different colleges on pre-reqs so shes struggling now she didnt realize how important those classes were I have classes who dont believe in textbooks. They just provide articles and the pdf format of stuff which is cool Others make me pay 1k yeah I remember my nursing program professor told us we all have to buy professional backpacks with rolling wheels You know the ones why? I dont need it. but she said it was a requirement and would flunk us out it wouldnt. Its a power move. I still have mine cause that shit was expensive I use it for traveling tho  Thanks for the vacation bag professor like reversible? you know how concerned Id be if you just unzipped a backpack and added a whole second part to it I need to Google this hold on What is it called?

You should consider living on the east coast during the fall to enjoy this 10/10 rainfall sound to sleep to I think you need to learn the difference between religion and spirituality seems like you're confusing the two its not a critique, its feedback. based off what you said, I am lending you a tip to support this path to awareness but pls go off. Snapchat now notifies you of unopened snaps sir, Im ignoring them. dont tell me theyre there pretty sure it was 24hrs I remember getting it yesterday and ignoring it then and then ignoring it now again nope, violin all the way although I find the sax really interesting let me just talk about the one I like. none of the brass interested me I picked mine based off what looked fun and I thought I looked good playing lol... so do that! I was gonna make a joke but imma stop myself lol wasn't funny or anything, was just gonna say how experienced I am with the frenchies lmfao oh hunny.... this aged well Someone convince me to not buy food I made rice :/ Not as satisfied I had them earlier, steamed broccoli and carrots. pork chop yummmm get subway or Panera Sometimes I think I want a pet and then I listen to you guys and decide its better if I dont I would be just as anxious since Im never home. Dont worry about that. I just wasnt raised with pets so I would have to take a whole class on how to raise one cause I dont know the little things about caring for one No, I dont want a fish. My sister has them and I take care of them Ive technically cared for dogs, fishies, and Guinea pigs. I also played doctor and told my niece her Guinea pig was going to be a mommy that birth was so quick. they were all so cute but their lifespan isnt the greatest WAIT You guys werent there for the Christmas Day fiasco  I think I joined the server afterwards nvm I just checked anyways, this demon child hurt our baby Guinea pig it can be constipated? Just do the warm wash cloth thing until you see that it gets easier and more frequent Im confused. How does your dad know the age? I thought you rescued this cat oh I swear you said you found it  my bad omg your dad is cutie for that surprise. my dad would never lmao YOU SAID FOUND SEE Im not tripping found usually means a stray So that goes back to the question how does he know the age without any tests at the vet? here comes fae to the rescue NO BAD DAD. Id tell him that he didnt waste his time bringing you a kitten for it to just collapse from illness So he gotta empty out the pockets or you can phrase it like Fae did  same brain, different energy Not to be all Emo but Im backing up my iCloud since Im gonna get a new phone and seeing all the numbers of people who passed away is wild I feel bad deleting their numbers, especially those I was closed to so I re-saved them. iPhone, you backup to a software to transfer data seamlessly I went through it to see what doesnt have to stay and saw the numbers of passed friends/family members whove died It feels wrong to delete their contact information so I just left them Ive been internally panicking at the thought that I might need glasses cause my eyes seem to have trouble adjusting when driving at night and extra blurry/wet. I then realized that its super cold in the morning and Ive aimed the warm air towards my face and its been drying my eyes out  I told myself that too and I wanted to cry Im scared of glasses. I dont want to be blind lmao I dont want to do any eye surgery/procedure and contacts seem irritating You wont convince me otherwise About not being blind lmao I also knew a girl in high school who would fall asleep with her eye contacts in and that shit was nasty Yup, her eyes were super red and crusty and it looked like she had some bad infection every time It would happen like twice a year but it was worrisome I know its not bad and Im being dramatic but I dont want to do either of them. I will do it when Im good and old how was this experience? like the process before and after? If I can find the right pair of glasses for my face, its over for you bitches EXCUSE ME I GAVE GOOD ADVICE the day yall learn that I give great advice and just choose to live reckless is the day we all know peace Happy Thanksgiving for everyone who celebrates & happy long weekend for those who dont  It officially has snowed. Light dusting over the cars here in MA Oh boy #choices-chat for general discussions or book channel for specifics please :) Np! Nice to meet you Ahmed continuing from #wholesome-pictures but if your name wasnt written on the bathroom stall.. https://tenor.com/view/gizelle-bryant-the-real-housewives-of-potomac-oh-my-sips-tea-sip-tea-gif-18412955 thats so sad! if a sibling did it but arent in school anymore, would that still be against it? Like one child per household ever or during the school year I just realized I miscounted my extension and submitted my assignment today when it was due yesterday :( someone else made the same mistake too I have an A+ in that class and the next portion of the assignment (there's three) is 20% of the grade so maybe I can save myself it's ethics which I consider really easy! I love debating and reading up on all the different concepts so I am doing well also- your brother is super fortunate to do an exchange program. I have always wanted to do it but my family depends on me too much I would've felt immense guilt. I could've easily said I'm going and everyone would've had to survive and that is where the guilt sets in. next spring I planned on going on this school trip to Italy but since covid post-poned it, I took the course so now I can't do it I am just super unlucky at times I try to remind myself lol you're right. I also say this to myself but I'm bad at listening to the smart side of me lol omg stop please kind words I love traveling, I will go anywhere I am allowed to. It's not about the place but the experience My top 3 are: Greece, Thailand, and France. only states and Puerto Rico, unfortunately. want to build a better resume Just got back from Pennsylvania and it was a nice travel. Loved the open fields and small communities nice to get away from the city life I always hear that when I say I want to do NICU lol. I have a way with kids, like they're super drawn to me so I think it works in my favor. Make them feel better why they're comforted by my presence you know yourself best. do what you can see building a long career in! in high school I traveled out of state to this camp that was designed to be a getaway for those with illnesses. every session had a different disease but it was such a blessing to be there and help the families I did it yearly for 4 years. I miss it. Kids can be so strong! you learn a thing or two when you take care of them. It is challenging though, not only for them cause they may have little understanding but you need to be super supportive of their parents. I was lucky to be told about this program though my professor! def look into things like that if you're interested hopefully one like it is near you omg don't apologize! always happy to talk I'm a nurse! we have a few people on this server in different career paths. it's so nice love hearing about what their work chaos is like cause I only know my own lol Yes Yeah! Milk has fat which helps with absorption of Vitamin D. Fat soluble vitamins Dont worry, theres things I Google just to remind myself if its true. If people think doctors or nurses dont do that- they severely misinformed lol it snowed Friday for us. I left work hella pissed and decorated with snow crystals Bundle up babe angry lil frosty babe is in this year lol Its warmer today at 37 degrees but it was 25 degrees that day and I didnt want to be outside My cousin got $25 for a tooth he lost. The way I wanna sucker punch both his parents Whats wrong with it lol LMAO Ray No. To the left, to the left Ray, we obvs cant stop you from reading it but you for sure shouldnt discuss that here if those are the themes. there's many reasons to get grey hairs my cousin has this pigmentation thing where there's a patch of grey hairs at his bangs. always had it since a little kid 11:11 make a wish its another way to say the other side happier side depends what you want to achieve from that that's what I mean. you can miss them, you can write to them to express things you don't want to share with others (as long as you do end up expressing yourself to others so you can get actual help if needed) or just to keep a connection/memory. if you feel like it becomes compulsory, its unhealthy. you shouldn't only write down your thoughts but vocalize to others to get their opinions and work through it I have this thing where I can get an A+, know that I did super well on an assignment and still be hesitant to read my professor's feedback. the first word is "excellent" and alarms are going off in my head lol I'm a mess. Amazing That sounded so sarcastic but I was driving and on the phone when I said that I didnt mean to be so dry lol. I know but you didnt deserve it Not for this anyways  Thank you for the hug btw Saw the reaction  Im his wife, of course I was one of the first people he messaged lol we did but totally will again for you ok, just remind me every month or else I wont it looked nice tho Note to self, screen protector and Apple Watch case + screen protector makes screen bulky. I just wanted to be safe :( If you feel like hanging out with them is like a chore instead of fun and interesting like it used to be. If you lost interest in them and dont mind the distance between you. Would you be ok falling apart because it means one less thing to care for/handle. Do they bring more negativity than positivity to your life. I dont come from personal experience, so I obviously cant share how hard that decision is to make. In my eyes, if someone doesnt care about you, for who you are, and they dont respect every part of you, than theyre not a good friend. So why bother keeping them around? I rather be alone than entertain fake friendships for the sake of having company. Cause thats not good company. Moving on from friendships isnt easy, but when you leave toxic friendships like this, youll find that part of it not being easy is because youve gotten used to it. Maybe even a little dependent on its predictability break that chain. Youll feel a void for a while, since youll lose some interaction with people youre used to having but youll find that you can fill it with other people. Other hobbies. Even just alone time I hope this goes well for you and that you find real friends. Everyone deserves to live their life and be supported. Youll find that  *sad noises* 12hr overnight shift pt2 Happy birthday babe! Turn it up! this is funny to me because whenever I have a cranky patient who is retaining urine, I just get it. I would be upset too if I cant sit and pee. Those are golden minutes Getting to the fun stuff lol Many of my patients go down for a KUB. Thats the extent of it Those who can control their bladder will have a cup or towel, something just there. Others get it drained out depends on the place I think I would put some heat on it, loosen it and see if it feels better with time. Could be many things Was gonna tell Drew to go to sleep but remembered I got a few hours on him lol Anyone got experience with GoFundMe. Primarily as the fundraiser? Project due in 12 days. Dont want to do it. :CB_annoyed: No. #multimedia-shabang I literally got assigned a whole ass student to precept. I AM IN CHARGE OF THIS NEW-GRAD . :yWorryShocked: it's the way this notecard has content I took a state board exam on. you're fighting for an A and I fought for my license. education is wack. pre-RN license exam- math, reading comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, critical thinking, physics, A+P, biology, microbiology,  & chemistry.
RN license exam- safe and effective care environment, health promotion and maintenance, psychosocial integrity, and physiological integrity. @kyo ready for this ish? sir? have you been MIA? I literally have been licensed for a year Kyo, you won't have to do all that since this is nursing specific. all the science and medical terminology is yours though. :cat_twerk: I'm sad twerking into work next week saturday can't believe they're trusting me to precept still in shock. Yes. I have a student who Im training  they decided my new ass is a perfect candidate Yes maam. Passing is how I got licensed Btw youre both very sweet. Its nerve wrecking knowing that Im shaping the student to be a good nurse. Im just gonna work hard to be what I wish I had when I first started I woke up to this and let out the biggest laugh Ive had to force myself to not write down 2022. like really bad. Im just ready @kyo do me a favor and promise that when youre working, you wont be snarky and tell the nurse that youre gonna check the IV cause whats the point of coming down if it doesnt work I wanted to punch the tech in the face. Just fucking check it and be quiet. We know it has to work. We are having a national flush shortage and yet we are making it work. Im naturally snarky too but I draw the line at offhand comments about someones capabilities on completing their job. Pt was critical, couldnt come off monitor so I traveled with them. Went all the way down there and thats what they greet me with. All because their IV site was bruised. She saw the purple ring and thought the IV was infiltrated. bitch; thats not what infiltration looks like but pls continue to tell me how Im wasting your time and not my own. Purple ring bruise, you know how its always a red dot at puncture site but the bruise forms around it. Thats just what I call it, purple ring Google the photos cause they can be kinda hard to see (for others) Infiltrated IV its the different damages that occur when the meds dont go into the vein but muscles Or just extracellular space it gets cold, pale, super big. Maybe even bloated purple if really bad and untreated Placement is really important. Im gonna take a course at the hospital to learn how to place them in case of emergencies Yikessss yeah, some nurses are horrible about hearing you out when you say the IV sucks I try to not be that nurse. some people have really bad veins though you gotta flush many times to keep it patent and people like to forget YOU TASTE IT oh you're one of those lmfsao I am super sick whenever I get one so my taste buds are not there always get hospitalized once a year for stomach flu mhm, it's like clockwork usually in Feb so.... here's to a special valentine's day me to my job once: don't feel well, think it's that time of the year.
them: ????
me, the next day: like my hospital band? haha it was funny too cause ED was overflowing so they send me to a private peds room. their logic was, well... kids get stomach flu's all the time. KYO ok yes I was curled up in a ball so I prob looked big and then I rolled out of bed to go hurl and the nurse was like "oh" this was the same night I told you that the nurse woke me up every hour cause she thought I was dead I don't snore or move in my sleep, especially when sick, cause I pass out from exhaustion. she kept being nervous oh I swear I told someone here I asked if she wanted to place a monitor on me and she's like "no it's ok, I trust you" and proceeded to disturb me omfg, I was their pet Iipitor is for cholesterol but I cant tell you off brand uses on any of them overuse of laxatives causes muscles to loosen but thats bad bad nerve response I honestly cant tell you what she wants Go with your gut Def not dantrium, soma, or flexeril. mhm I give them, sadly. that happened to my friend She miscarried at 5 weeks. just after she found out Yay. I was on the right track It depends. They fucked up by not explaining the kind Diff types work diff ways I didnt say it cause I didnt want to lead you wrong  Rather you make your own mistakes LMAO next saturday is my weekend on so probs not, unless you do it late today lol thursday after school off friday too so sure its been so long since I last went to a concert I need my artist to come here so I can fix this. Hope you had a wonderful time! Concerts are magical. 100/10 recommended to everyone Doesnt matter if youre front row or the damn rafters. Its such a positive, beautiful atmosphere. @azula Miss Philippines is fucking beautiful oh my lord Im not watching but keeping tabs and she is stealing the show just standing there. Wow, a win for you guys for sure. Apparently people said they dressed my girl and did her hair ugly :( Two years in a row she didnt make it to top 5 I saw! good for her. oh really? here I was going to say I love when new countries win lmao I didn't watch this year, so I know little about the competitors. Just saw on fb Miss P and I was like shit, she's the most gorgeous there A FUCKING WOMAN. HOLY SHIT. gimme a crumb of beauty pls  ily wooo Mine hasnt changed Whats the difference I renewed this month and it was exactly the same My mom got an upcoming endoscopy/colonoscopy appointment at 6:30am no, its just a checkup cause shes at that age Ive never had any procedures like that Only thing I ever had done was a full on EKG test after I had a night where I had severe pain where I couldnt move or properly breathe Pretty sure they thought it was a heart condition. Quite literally forgot all about it but sure I have a project Im supposed to work on anyways so Ill be up What works for you I do work the next day bright and early so preferably near 9pm if you need it to be late So like lunch? Im free all day. Will be home doing hw unless out buying food bad bitch Hiya Want me to get on? Sure ping when youre on lol That panini place I always drives half an hour away to grab just opened a location down the street from me Im in actual heaven hung out and got drunk with coworkers. did a Yankee Swap with them (first time). it was a great day WAIT KYO STFUB WE GOT THE SOFT LITTLE KITTY LAMP LMAO The one you slap and change colors  & yes, we had a whole argument on the difference between white elephant vs Yankee swap 1. Stop washing your hair everyday.
2 eat healthy and hydrate.
3. Cold water is better for your hair.
4. Dont smoke.
5. Dont stress about it, genetics are a bitch but you can not make it worse by agonizing over it No. It strips the natural oils thats protects the hair Youre supposed do to 1-2 a week max. Always leave in condition and do a hydrating mask weekly also, idk where you live but harsh weather conditions also affect your hair. Like winter months here for me, I cant wash my hair and go out or by the next week, its brittle asf If I wash my hair everyday and go to the beach most of the week,  now its dry and hay-like. shampoo is what stripes the natural oils, so thats the aggressive one. When you do wash your hair, use both cause the shampoo cleans the scalp and then the conditioner brings some softness and texture back. If you do it constantly + other environmental stuff? Thats where the problem occurs cause youre losing more than gaining you can see what kind works best for you but thats a trial and error thing I used to switch brands every month &  see which month I liked my hair most lol There are conditioning detangler sprays From a curly hair girl Ive never tried a DYI but I feel like you can. Its mostly oil or water as a base but Ive not super sure on it. ngl, ever since I was a little girl I used the brand no more tangles cause its for little girls who cried when their hair got brushed LMFAO I use a more oil based now. Its Cancun I think. Ill take a photo tomorrow if someone reminds me Yes, leave in conditioners are super heavy and shouldnt be an everyday thing. I do it once a week, usually Saturdays cause thats my dedicated Me day. So I use it to pamper myself wait why am I the opposite??? I feel line my hair goes: wavy, curly, and then curly or straight depending on damage lol Never hair curly roots in my life ok first rule, never get a 2-1 cause its not trustworthy. how can one bottle really do both things if theyre total opposites Ive always said blessed people@ (*ahem* straight haired men *ahem*) can get away with that cause theyre just gifted for some damn reason like how they always have fucking long,luscious eyelashes fight me lmao youre just over washing I feel. FIREWORK PLS I WILL KICK HIM L LOL Its the toothpaste for me  :o save the baby lol Dont let them fall into the hands of a multi rinser MOOD straight men use one towel in the shower and I hate them for it. one for the body, one for the face & maybe another for the hair if youre feeling frisky. end tweet. LMFAO AHHHHHHH FAE NOOOO & Metta go home baby, why are you wiping your ass dry and then drying your face with the same towel  do you remember which went where each time?? if you do. Solid memory, come to the casino with me less showers save waters tf this is why yall got acne onfg fae, imma give you a slide but still no. Get a washcloth tiny and easy Several people are typing and I bet only one of them got something good to say I make jokes and I sound mean but I dont judge Let me save your hair and promote hygiene. I physically need it at this point l. Metta, go to your damn room jfc Wait Curly hair gang Wide tooth comb. Amen. give it time and be kind to it Are you due for a haircut? Youll notice how much longer youll go out without another one if you continue this after one && youre welcome. and if you do use shampoo, just focus on roots since thats the dirty part but use small dime size since you dont need much. Conditioner goes halfway on the hair and to the ends since they get most neglected & dont rub either in cause it causes tangles I have a project due at midnight and its going bad my phone is so mean to me today, autocorrecting nothing thank you! its a personal ethics project and writing everything down is daunting. min 800 words with like 6 sections. Lol Ive done worse but this one is kicking my butt I submitted my project Written essay, 8 pages. 2.5k words. I feel like I followed the rubric and still did it wrong lmao Im gonna throw up I have a patient who does not believe in COVID or that shes positive. Shes currently gearing up for an ICU transfer because of hypoxia secondary to COVID. :) nah, not traumatizing. I'm above thinking I can save everyone... had to give that reminded to a doctor though. he was down in the dumps... anyway, yeah. I'm used to patient's who either lack education or are just in denial. it's our job to educate and theirs to accept it. 83% she was on 5L NC beforehand. got triggered for 10L on oxymizer. nasal cannula aka the lowest oxygen delivery there's a conversion chart she was on a non-rebreather momentarily before using the oxymizer. we have a rule about no high flow use outside of the ICU because of covid, so she was maxed out on the oxymizer and was risking the ICU transfer if she did not stabilize I got her down to 8L today. it can also be your shampoo/conditioner. I use a more oily one once a week just to rejuvenate Its really sad society has failed us to the point where we think simple, kind gestures is a person showing their romantic interest in us. we need more love and affection platonic & romantic whats the jacket tho Ill tell you if he meant it or not  my dad has this horrible habit of not flushing after using the bathroom and I want to strangle him asparagus smells is just not in my dude. flush or fuck off M E N Yes babe. Thats today lmao Cuteee! Have a beautiful time  For food? Ham & pineapple, rice with pigeon peas, roast pork shoulder, & macaroni salad LMFAO thats our go to & we party and get druuuuuuuuunk coquito come on girl I cant find my nose rings lol I see the little bag it came in, its just chilling on my dresser but not the bag that contains them :( just noticed FB officially changed to Metta I picked up OT today since they were short and they cancelled me 10 minutes ago because of low census on my unit. It be your own people  Im in the middle of that sick journey where my stomach and head arent on the same page I am craving food but have no actual appetite or will to eat send help. In the 8 months Ive been working, I havent called out nor showed up late to work. That being said, management is losing their minds that I called yesterday night lol lmao theyre just checking on me but yeah I got texted three times in the past two days I just wanna sleep and break my fever and they keep asking me if I got COVID tested and what not yeah, Im neg. Didnt expect to not be its part of the criteria to go back Update. My cousin just texted me and told me shes COVID positive  Im still negative, which yay for me, but now I gotta self isolate for work. Jfc My niece tested positive as well. So far, my sister and I both tested negative. I have to wait for my hospital to call me and confirm if I need to re-test or not cause I mightve done it too soon and it couldve been a false reading. & this is what happens when sick people dont stay home, folks. :) babe, I feel like crap and everyone keeps coming to me for info. I just want to sleep and not be sweaty anymore. Update: my job told me to re-test. Thank you! Yeah, germs suck. its me. COVID legend. Its keeps trying my ass tho Im literally breaking out into a sweat straightening my hair so I look pretty for my shift so I feel less like shit the feminine urge. I swear Happy New Years to all of those on the other side! I hope it brings nothing but joy and success to all of you  & to those who arent there yet, get ready for the same  Im on for 3 I had 4 days off since I was sick so you really win and lose sometimes welcome to the real worlddddd Doctors offices are so boring but I swear Im gonna switch to it for the 9-5, no weekends and no holidays  the population of my floor went up to 95% COVID positive. 5 reg staff are COVID positive and out for the next couple of weeks. :) I always waited til it was absolutely necessary. Never got a ticket  find time between the class that you can just drop by the office so its not busy. But just make sure you dont go around lunch or youll just waste your time colleges be trying to steal money any way they can I feel like they dont tell you but first week is always a I didnt see shit kind of week. They just letting you vibe wait Kyo, were all your classes online last semester? Thats why Ive seen you on damn, shouldve gotten the permit when it was free my college permit is so fucking expensive but jokes on them, my hospital is down the street so I park at the garage I need more info on the game Im in Fae is in charge of the pets lol I think going in blind Id be a better defender since I am better reacting  when unsure of my job. Once I pick it up, Id be good offensively Ill go with support. need to save all your reckless butts My professor emailed us about a month and a half ago telling us that we dont have class this Thursday. Cool, fine. I picked up another shift because of it. Come to find out that even though I dont have class, theres this separate program Zoom session Ill have to be a part of which is now clashing with 2 of my schedules. Im gonna riot. Update: my manager switched two of my shift days so I can attend class. Shes a rockstar, she even scheduled in my class time as OT so I can receive holiday bonus & incentives. whats a break. my phone keeps doing this glitch where if I answer it and accidentally tap the screen again, it automatically hangs up It does it even if I dont hit the decline button. Its so frustrating, Ive done it to 3 diff people It is new. I cant tell if its a glitch in the software or sensitivity. In general Its not all the time but I notice if I double tap the screen it happens @faede any snow yet? were getting on and off little frosties but nothing solid.

It does the black screen thing OH BITCH Say less Unless it can be fixed on my phone, no use. my friend and I have like 5 shows we gotta watch and have t Which one do you wanna do Black mirror or AHS Black Mirror got some cool concepts Theres one part on Netflix thats supposed to be like a game? We make choices. Idk how it works but my friend begged me to try but alas Yes I know I cant on my phone but I assumed it was the same on the laptop if it aint, thats cool but please do he gotta gimme some of that wisdom do some for me get a new one homie just drop it and end its life Kyo I can give you my old one. let me find it and Ill ship that shit  Oh wait nvm. I returned it homie really forgot we had Christmas its either birthday or graduation now for you Me either but sometimes you gotta do it Ill be mad if you get a better phone than me iPhone 13 Didnt want to wait for the pro max If you wanna compromise, wait til the 14 I think its made it this far and if you did wait, itll still be the most recent model. Way ahead of your 6 models behind we dont claim Samsung in this house I dont think Ive ever had a Samsung but I def had androids. Theyre cool and all. Loved the hacks, hated the quality of everything else Overheating mf I replaced mine 4x for software stuff I BUTT DIALED ALL THE TIME oooo Youd be first in line Throwing hailmakers elbowing stomping Me on Black Friday Fae would be the one to do tricks on the Wii I loved the home run derby That was my shit the amount of times I played strapless and let that fucker fly outta my hands to the plasma screen :eKissmiddlefinger: LMAO bet bro check that temp again Unless youre blue and naked from hypothermia Was it your forehead? if its by the mouth, Im very concerned. Other areas are less exact but still shouldnt be that oh bitch wtf why your hand??? LMFAO Hands are so far from your heat source, but no part of your body should be that low anyways. I would do an oral one just to confirm your actual temp but I wouldnt be too concerned unless your fingers are blue and numb and all that shit Alas I am watching a movie How was your shift? BMI is a crappy scale. Height, weight, and genes are so complicated to just use a damn calculator of what they think my body size should be Im super short so at 120lbs I was already overweight despite this being my body size Thats ??  Not ??? Fat ??? I was 15 in that photo. So they gave me a complex that I couldnt ever shed yes. We still use it (unfortunately) but its severely flawed. thats better does the pinch hurt? never done it but it seems like Oh  You know what Im talking about tho right that shit in super size me Phew THAT LOOKS HORRIBLE SEE WHAT I MEAN I always had a curvy body which always made me look more full. its not my fault I got boobs and butt  but I have an hourglass figure so my actual waist is tiny. its so annoying the umbers is how they calculate fat in th body. But it just seems like torture to me. YES broad shoulders is a struggle my friend deals with. I always have to calm her down because she cries whenever we go dress shopping Thats a perfectly fine body size Firework. Thats why I hate BMI scales. Its so stupid button ups are a dream  this is so unrelated but is that your bedroom?! queen shit Its huge and I like the vibe boujee its just expensive to live here so Im in a decent apartment I cant wait to buy a house though my only problem is that I want it for a lot of years to come but Im going to eventually have to move if I dont get a second bedroom cause itll be a problem when I start my family we love pajamas lol omg next time we do movie night can we drop pj selfies itll be like a sleepover Ill wear my cute ones LMAO GO OFF I feel that fae. Im def a clothes for bed wearer or nightgowns No in between I sleep half naked. I cant do the full nude cause I get cold easily Big shirt and boy shorts. Thats the shit I like whats a saris oh I just googled it. I didnt know the name, sorry. I can imagine the beauty of a full figure in one. If it wasnt appropriation, Id love to wear one. when is it? Close! I hope it all goes well and you have fun I figured it would be cause Ive heard people make comments when someone uses a costume for Halloween I dont know if its because theres symbolism or just the day itself so if I went to an Indian wedding, is it expected that I wear one or is it more for the family involved? omg yay someone help me find one I can tell. Theyre gorg Ive always wanted to dress up as Jasmine from Aladdin lmao I will not. I love clothes and I love people being in tune with their culture. Its just the best of both worlds  I wont stop you either Just made sure to teach me :O how short is your hair Wow what a badass I am super attached to my hair. Never had anything shorter than my bra line I want to go shoulder length but I have a super round face and think Ill look extra fat I have bangs lol Theyre growing out now but theyre there dead I want to drop kick my fucking sister. She literally doesnt help out with my mother at all and expects me to help out more Maam I put in longer hours at work I drive farther out than you.

I just witnessed the most adorable video on fb a family is watching a scary movie and one of the boys got scared but looked over at dad and saw that he wasnt scared so he basically mimics his dads position. Someone in the comment pointed it out and said its the little things that they copy and shes damn right. wholesome I just let out the saddest little laugh. youre so right  its with a C But essentially Tengo control
Estoy controlada lmfao Full of Tanos lmao its cute, our area is called Borinquen (Boricua) Which we still refer to nowadays Are you being funny? lmao. I swear Ive dropped that Im Hispanic like 30x Yeah, I live in Boston (MA) LOL Unfortunately no, I live in the states. Its where Im licensed I plan on changing that eventually not sure, I would have to experience all my dream countries to make that decision. if I lived somewhere with a low minimum wage, Id be making bank rn. But MA is expensive so I live broke girl status Im light for a Puerto Rican but too dark for an American  Viv and I living there same problem but in reverse I SAID IT ONCE AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN FILIPINA Ive interacted with too many for me to not say it Pretty firework only Viv would go bra-less with a tank top and bikini bottoms what a look lol never forget when Viv challenged me to a whose whiter contest and went from real brave to losing in a split second  my white is like spicy white for many I was home sick for a week and went to work and someone said I look like I got a tan Maam, this is post cold flush  Pixie Fae  doesnt it look so soft and luscious I just wanna play with it send us both to sleep lol everyone whose ever met me says this. Its a way of life POPPY IS PETITE BUT SHE IS TALL PETITE supermodel tall  I remember I wanted to do gymnastics and my parents said no cause I was too tall for hitting an early growth spurt these fuckers I AM THE PERFECT SIZE FOR GYMNASTICS I couldve been the next fucking Olympian https://tenor.com/view/yes-yes-yes-gif-22948122 9. you really living my fantasy height difference with Jax Yes.

Rae trynna find a new crush I saw a photo of lady Gaga without heels and laughed because shes so cute and tiny and then someone said shes my height I wanted to die I LITERALLY LAUGHED CAUSE HER HEIGHT WAS FUNNY ONLY TO REALIZE THATS WHAT PEOPLE DO WITH ME we tell kids that if they stand, it makes them taller Thats just our adult way to sit down without asking for their seat Should I get chic fil a or mall food aka, sandwich or some kind of Asian food mm, it does sound nice I want pasta but I only eat fresh mall pasta. Dont like when its chilling there my local Pizza Hut takeout service shop was closed :( my niece got fucking fouled at her basketball game and mightve fractured her wrist. shes currently in the ER getting evaluated  Were waiting for the X-ray but shes in a lot of pain. I just wanna drive over and give her the pain meds she needs :( I WANT TO starting the new year with one arm aint it my sister was at the game and said it was a flagrant foul so homie couldve gotten socked I had a confused patient who kept trying to jump out of bed and his room is so far from the nurses station that I would full on sprint to his room before he fell I did this so many times my Apple Watch literally congratulated me on the exercise  shes a runner, shes a track star @faede movies tonight? girly got home from work and she wont be sleeping in a while Im ready when you are, just heating up food @red hot silly pepper you up? OMG Not you Rae sorry  @rashon24 you up? youre more than welcome to join  Hope I didnt wake you or anything I deadass was gonna be like you up babe? but deleted the babe thank god. You wouldve been like ???!??!! NOT AT ALL she just wasnt the first one on my mind  you know what, next time Im gonna invite Rae first. My heart will be broken when she says no but its to redeem myself I use sanitation wipes that you clean counters and stuff with on my phone I do it after I finish my shift and in between other stuff since you always touch something dirty if youre at school or work, we sometimes use lab specimen bags  Isnt this like the third time? Girl, what are you eating: is there a special diet they want you to follow to minimize this risk? I didnt realize I fell asleep with YouTube on my phone and I was just casually scrolling through my notifications to see what I missed when I heard a menacing growl lmao I was so confused somehow it switched from cartoons to puppies in a box JASON MOMOA IS SINGLE I feel so disgusting and I want to throw up. No, Im not feeling well AGAIN. My immune system sucks, my coworkers are all sick. My patients are all sick. I cant tell whats weather change, regular sickness, or COVID Im trying to get a test but no luck booking an appointment. I am on all weekend as well so I really want to test to make sure I dont have to go cause Im just sleeping these past 2 days. No energy to do anything else I can but I want the test for background info. If Im positive, I have the 5 day quarantine. If I dont, it comes out of my sick pay Appreciate it. This is gonna be my life til COVID dies back down and then when it sparks back up unfortunately Thank you, I dont seek the good karma but surely want to be healthy and not get my own loved ones exposed. Kevin thank you Im going to try and find some me time wait, Ahmed. The BMW 3 series was a hilarious comment cause my friend def had one. But the hot car was the 2013 Lexus ES350. You def knew some drug deals were being made when they busted that one out all red too. Couldnt be more obvious it was niceeeeee BOY every 3 months. Min. just go to a shop and they print the little sticker that tells you it does but thats a good baseline so you dont accidentally fuck the fumes up they calculate from the last mileage to this one change and they estimate how often you normally drive and rack up to give you the next date/numbers they only scam when they say you need to fix stuff and thats with yearly renewal not oil change depending on how many miles you rack up between oil changes, they calculate the est next time you need to do it again. I think everyone should know basic car maintenance. Being into cars is def a separate topic thats more of a hobby in my eyes I know to do oil changes, refill fluids, restart battery, and change a tire. Thats all I need to live and be safe. you can ask your dad, usually a good place to start. are you a demo or written or all of the above kind of learner? I usually like to be told how to do something, then watch it, then do it. So thats how I went about it I feel like written instructions almost never get it right so thats why I rather hear, see, and do. but if reading is good for you look up instructional how tos online *cue heavy rain* I dont get motion sickness on its own but when I am a passenger in the backseat I almost always feel ill. Something about not having fresh air in my face So, shotgun or driving for me. I have a lot of family members which means a lot of body heat. Its winter here so you cant exactly risk hypothermia. People usually hate highway sounds when the windows are down. Etc the rule is that the driver sets the tone. So if they dont put AC on or roll down windows, you kinda go with it. I just ask them to let me do something or else I will throw up  PSA: if Lu is overheated, she will throw up. The end. I actually never have but Im super nauseous. I hate throwing up so I really be shoving it down I love Highway breeze and sounds but nearly everyone I know hates it like I said, driver controls so you gotta deal oh no, I love scenic routes. If theres a good view, Im chilling come to PR I live on one lmao if theyre a good driver, yeah its me imma get my niece to come on vc and tell you guys the time she had a blast when I drifted at an exit at 85mph she and her brother done lost their shit I was driving a Toyota Matrix! Lmao. Im a pedal to the medal kind of gal My vibe car was an old 2004 Honda Civic men literally are such horn dogs when I got out every time my civic was decked out tho! lowered, tinted glass, led headlights Im not a rims girl but I know that the guy to put some on was and he told me theyre hot no one ever clowned me so I agree Men: when they saw me get out 
Men: when they realized its stick :stitchangry: :stitchangry:  goodnight kyo it wasnt the car lol, its me some men just dont like a girl who can drive better than them Small dick energy they would ask me to race and its like bro, chill. Im not into cars, but I do love a good drag race. same. it was my first car. Drove since I was 14 and took my test with it its a household ritual. everyone starts stick and then we choose after that I only got my automatic since I drive long distance all the time but then I lost that car so Im back to the manual manual/standard. nah, car accident. it would cost more to fix it than to get paid for it so I let them take it, got 5k not bad for an old car yuuuuup. pain. Im more reckless in automatics. Hence my car accident being in one  although I drive even faster with stick, theres something about the control high awareness and all got my 3rd covid test yesterday, since I still have my cold and feel even worse than before. Im positive  thanks  not as common but is one of our recessive genes yeah, my friends bf is a redhead too my cousin was a darker ginger but his brothers are the most tanned mfers too betty white totally not always a fun time to learn about cannibals LMFAO PRI you only get one date, no matter how many times you've submit say less I AM FUCKING CRYING RN YOU GUYS HAD NO RIGHT TO MAKE ME LAUGH THIS HARD whoever sent that is gonna regret it :) like the staff team match each other? don't think so, none of us has asked for it yet are you trying to set me up lol valentine's day finna be a blast if that's the case weak if you love me, just say it. no racism allowed alsdkfjhg kidding, that is weird. we will check it out your butt must be flat asf with all that sitting get a thigh master lies no one speaks of it take this shit to NSFW.

I dont like people spending money on me but if you dox me, youll dox yourself and I wont be held responsible if I show at your house for head pats I would genuinely burst into tears cause I need one urgently did we all wake up today and decide we want to make Lu cry? I cant handle the affection rn my first night back was so rough, cant wait to go home and pass out. too bad Ill have to wake up tonight to go back again are we not gonna acknowledge that Rae stood Fae & I up.... :TDK_BlueSadUwU: :( oopsies hope you felt more rested lol it's cool I figured something came up so I didn't bother to @ nah, wasn't that serious lol. I figured if you were bored you would've joined haha anyways, the real reason I came on was because I wanted to say I'm also on my laptop since my phone is acting up & that I am finally working on my genogram and I hate every second of this. why do I gotta share my family's dirty secrets? I'll do it with no shame but why is this a thing prof: we are learning about predisposition
me: literally been a nurse for a fucking year and work on a cards unit, think I'm ok on that regard. omg a diamond no name, just pet she wants dirty secrets and I'm giving it to her wrote down all my momma's mental illnesses :) and I plan on doing a story time on the time I 5150'd her ass my prof wants 3 gen, grandparents, parents, and us. no spouses of my siblings or kids so nitty gritty I also told her I'm hispanic and medical conditions aren't something we talk about lightly. we don't share that info, my mom isn't an accurate historian, and her parents are both dead. so like ??? Kyo lmaoooo. I wish you were in my class I assume make it up? wow, my grandparents died in their 80's, wow. Lu, you know what that means :) like thanks, I knew this. can I go home now? I wanna DNA test myself but I don't want to be hurt kawJSdhfgx you can tell me I'm adopted and I'd believe you. these fuckers all got problems and I'm vibing from health history, to temperament and physical looks. I'm just the odd duck I also got emailed that I have a package on its way and I didnt order shit.

These last two night shifts were bad and this weekend seems like it wont be better Thanks Rae  Im possibly being floated to a new floor on Saturday so lets hope I make new friends or find the loml bet theres this little sweet doctor on my floor and hes an adorable nerd. Little to no confidence Kept asking me for my input  Hed be like does this sound better okay? Whats the highest parameter
Me: its subjective. Do what you want aka what I want is you to set this heart rate parameter up to 150 or youll hear from me again. not my type but not unattractive I gotta see him outside of work but Im too strong for him. Probs make him cry yeah hes super tall tho. Wed be tall soft boy and short Latina cliche WAIT LOL I just remembered he tried to break the ice by telling me he went to a Jewish summer camp with my coworker LMAOOOO Is that a pigtail clip or huge daisy earrings I cant decide nah youre really into this so sure What kind of humor is it? Sorry I havent watched the clip nice any actor Id know? SHUT UP My friend is cleaning out her camera roll and I found one of my funniest comments but also a super bitchy thing I said in a group chat  Why am I like this uh kyo I work all weekend btw. Next week Id have more time omg sure, I gotta find it for context NO I KNOW She sent the one line cause I know exactly what I said but you wouldnt omg this is so toxic def not gonna showcase the best part of me but I can explain if you guys have questions  take a guess  blue  also who changed the gc name after the girl left which is why everyone was acting blind in the last context: she was making these shirts and wanted us to promo. I was like cool, send it to me and Ill post wearing it and give shoutout. She told me how much it was worth which was really expensive for a self made tee and I was like oh, I thought it would be a freebie since you want me to promo and she lost her shit. Like full on telling me (and the other girl) why we are super inconsiderate and assholes It seemed so out of place for the question I asked so then I asked if its because I forgot her birthday lmao RIGHT WAS I WRONG??? you pay me for promo or give me the free shirt You cant just do both lemme see if I can find the exact amount LITERALLY She said she worked super hard on the shirt and that she wasnt gonna give it away for free for all the work she did and I was like thats fine, but I get nothing out of this. Its cool, I want to do the solid but just give me the shirt girl at that time, I was also popular on twitter in the 5sos fandom because someone started a rumor that I was a groupie which is why she wanted me to do it  anyways, I cant find the receipts of how much she said but I think it was like $26 or something like that. Not the worst but also more pricey for something Im doing for HER Ive made and sold volleyball tee shirts for less. Come on girl. TL:DR my friends made a joke post about how I had the drummer on Snapchat (fact) & we knew someone who ran in their circle so we would get some tea which we would spill for fun. Since we knew info and I was pretty, they assumed I slept with them. also I have some moments here I look like the guitarist gf so people confused me a few times and I was like uh. Bro. We arent twins. Relax but anyways, 16yo arent smart LMFAO dkshdjshshsh Im telling you, you probs wouldnt like me in high school. ok I was a mean girl but I wouldnt just be an ass to random people. just didnt like people who tried me. I had friends in all the circles since I was a straight A student and did all the extracurricular we wouldve been those classmates who were like hi/bye type shit wouldnt mind sitting with you, etc but my main group was obviously mean girl shit. the bad boys yeah, I always said I want to present myself a certain way but not be it? so, look at me wearing my whore clothes and hear me talk all that shit and be like yeah, shes a bitch who sleeps around but Im top of my class, on student council, national honor society, and did sports quirky shit Lmao stop history was never my strong suit listen, idc what they say.. high schoolers got layers I respect the shit out of them. Dumb asf even when the smartest but theres so much more than what they say and do. I graduated top 5 of my class and I would literally do all-nighters, binge drink and go jump off a cliff at a quarry which probs had like 30 submerged cars and diseases but volunteered at a local food pantry and summer camp like who tf was I YES I wouldve been friendly with yall and thats the hill I will die on you wouldnt like the people I surrounded myself with tho Ive never disrespected a teacher either. I hated and called out anyone near me who would put them through shit Im a bitch but thats a line Dont cross it. kyo, Id prob like you a little more because of that oh shit, look whos here smarty pants oh the two reactions LOL I cant tell which one of us sounds more condescending even tho we werent  I loved math DAMN I knew the most random formulas and what not but was bad at others. But its because they forced me to do a specific way and I just couldnt Let me do it my way bitch!! does it matter how I got there if its right yeah, Id do that a little too often. Theyd be like I know youre not cheating cause you did the wrong conversion but Im also confused why youre struggling if youre pulling things out of your ass I died when he said that cause he was a casual swearer. Didnt so often unless he was extremely confused I only know the bonds and reactions in chemistry and that was enough for nursing school GROSS Starting the day with gym sucked. Why do I want to be sweaty I loved ending with gym because it was right next to the exit my bus driver didnt fucking care who was there or wasnt, if it was 2:10 she was down the block already pretty sure she was on meth hand the time. Lady was nuts I used to tell myself Id take the pacer test seriously and then do up to 10 and see the boys literally acting like it was the Olympics tryout and just chill I would fake run til the teacher noticed me it was fun. it was like 30 mins of me sitting there watching which boy thought he was gods athletic gift my high school peers liked it. Randomly asked for it when it was a no schedule kind of class but middle school was where it was at one time my teacher asked me why I wasnt putting in effort and I told her that we have a weight room with a plasma tv and a wii console why tf do I gotta run now? I loved the fitness room tho damn nah, we would vote for which activity I did the elliptical and maybe some random yoga stuff it was great had my first in person class this semester and already over this shit just pointless lol thats a weird joke for someone who got COVID for being exposed at work caring for that exact population Lmao the being in person. its basically a sims class but its nothing I dont already know. BSN program for nursing is useless cause its all repeat shit. Nothing substantial only look forward to the community health portion since I love educating and caring for people. Any way I can help them care for themselves is a win no, its hard to explain for those who dont do it its fine tuning your skills which is great, but I think its dumb timing and I dont like how colleges are handling COVID idc about any of that as long as they dont make me do their dirty work people can advocate for themselves if they want to go in or not I dont get that choice. I shouldnt have been allowed to go in today but they bent the rules their way to do it go catch up on some rest to recharge and tackle the next ones! You got this!! she must be so pissed reverse psychology didn't work LOL my little pixie babe it looks like hes gonna charge me 6 flies to get in. I really hope this winter storm isnt as bad as theyre making it seems because I work overnight this entire weekend and traveling from home and back is going to be stressful Same as Fae. Very heavy storm, the winds are blowing harshly. I dont know how Ill drive into work tonight but itll be an adventure for sure I am just always unlucky and have a storm on my birthday.

Some people dress to impress I had a good look yesterday and everyone was like Lu, not that you dont always look good but youre hot today  they were being kind I can stroll in looking like a hot mess on day 4 Nah. I wear scrub pants, anything from typical ones youd picture to joggers or tight ones for my butt Scrub tops if Im lazy, long sleeves and vest if Im feeling cute, or reg t shirt if its night shift and I want to be comfy I wear nails whenever I want. It is a risk for infection but I always have gloves and Im mindful of not hurting skin. I wear earrings and makeup when I want to be dressed up but I usually remove earrings if I have behavioral pts and makeup free if I have precautions cause the PPE is super hot its someone giving my number to fake number  I was supposed to buy a dress for this weekend and ended up spending $300 on makeup and curling irons  oops. Guess well try again tomorrow Ive had two attractive guys check me out but not approach me. Sigh. Come on. build some courage cause I want some love. gotta simmer down some or Ill be forever single This asshole at the restaurant did not ID me  He was really kind and awkward so maybe, MAYBE he forgot but thats just wistful wishing rn also my friend, who is a mom & nurse, just stood me up.

Severely. I was always called frizzy haired by EVERYONE. Always negative. So I figured frizzy wasnt a bad thing. I found out today it fucking means curly hair, like an array of different curls. Thats literally fucking me. In conclusion, I learned this today because my coworker told the doctor who was searching for me shes the one with the frizzy hair and I laughed so hard cause ouch. I had my hair done and curled for the past 2 weeks and let my natural just breathe today but she got upset and was bewildered that I was offended because she thinks frizzy hair is beautiful. She kept promising it wasnt a bad thing and asked me why I thought so I honestly try not to care cause my response is if youre not paying for my hair, guess you gotta deal but it felt nice that a straight haired chick likes my messy hair also the unkept, messy is just a mood. Curls are wild and thats fine. Neat curls are beautiful but theyre too. Perfected. I like natural Yup! The combo of acne cream, condensation, & mask causes the worst acne flare up Im gonna die I always get cystic ones :( screaming, crying, & throwing up. My childhood. You live in California and never saw a person in a fedora? Tf you aint never seen a student in a Fedora??? theater kids are extra in the east I guess what personality does a fedora wearer have I like a person who can rock a fedora takes style Its such a beautiful day today. Im thriving with this sunshine & breeze combo @faede ready to lose an hour of sleep why is it always your power jfc Homies need better wifi my brain is not working rn ong Company** Its snowing here too.

https://heardle.app Wow we love pop culture fans You listen to the snippet of a song and guess it. You can add more seconds if youre lost but the max is like 15s Its easy and for fun. I went to work at 7am with 20% of battery and Im leaving at 7:20pm with 6% I have no idea how it survived that long but Im glad it did. My phone was blowing up all day I confused it for my pager a few times my battery was low because my charger is damaged and I guess the angle didnt let the current run but Im happy with the way it put up lol had it been my old Motorola shit wouldve been dead within 1 and burning a hole in my pocket Sunday I was gonna be off after tomorrows shift but they were overstaffed tomorrow and short on Friday so I split my 12hrs and now Im doing 4hrs of OT. My two nieces and mom are celebrating their birthdays on Saturday. thank you! my friends keep asking me to do the too loud challenge lmao I know exactly what youre talking about and we used to call it penis game This is the tik tok trend where you shake your ass lol THE WAY I KEPT CIRCLING THE DAMN COUNTRY 14 guesses tho I honestly kept thinking it was the answer but I was like.. noo and then it was I couldve had it in 4. Tops.  My coworkers want me to be resource which means that I would be in charge of the floor. Scheduling, assigning beds, educating, etc. All that would fall on me. I appreciate the vote of confidence but Im not there right now lmao also the night crew keep asking me to do perm nights cause they say Im the most adapted I JUST GOT APPROVED 2 WEEKS OF VACATION Im!!So!!Excited!! Guess who sliced her nail peeling potatoes  I was prepping for my nieces bday party the sacrifice of a good aunt I also just recently broke my other nails at work during an emergency Lmao I was slicing, doing a good job, went through a whole bag. Was on my last potato and my sister stepped to the sink, I stepped aside and didnt move my finger so when I threw my hand forward I caught the edge of my nail I dont work until Monday so I have it wrapped with a bandaid, letting it dry out and then Ill cut it thank you so much!!  hiii babes! Miss you Hope youre having a lovely day! Hi!! How are you? been better, life is sucky rn but nothing to do but deal. Tom Holland and Zendaya are just strolling through Boston and I wanna know why I also want to run into him and see how hot he is in person cause I got an opinion truly my nail isn't dry yet and keeps lifting. I want to trim it so bad but it's too soon the split part, it's just getting caught and just resting in a place it got no business of I am happy to announce my finger is not hurting anymore and I trimmed it Now onto the healing process and regrowth My nail says thanks GOLDEN PUPPY OMG why are they being posted here? wholesome content folks!! love how kyo randomly comes in and mentions things not being in the right channel but then does this  tsk tsk. I like to scroll in the channel and be happy I cant with all the talking here I lose the puppy pics No thats a lot steps for me and none for you :mlem: tell me more. :Wait_What: Good luck!!! Youll be fine. You stress the most before you ace nothing like doing a whole discussion post and then realizing that no one stayed with their topic from last week. now I'm unsure if I misread the instructions or if they did, Look up your schools handbook. Ive had professors who require my camera to be on during meetings and to post selfies for our first week discussion. Ive never had a problem with it, given that if we were in-person, they would see my appearance anyways. Some people like a face to a name, makes work more interactive. That being said, if its their rule vs the schools rule, you can go against it if you speak to the right people. Say youre not comfortable, etc and they may let it go since it may not be a requirement in all the classes. You may win this battle, but know you may lose the war because if youre approved to not show your face/post yourself, the teacher may remove you from the course. FYI, the family thing is weird to me. I know people post themselves and their babies, but Ive never posted my family pictures. Only verbally spoken on them. Not to offend you, but youre a literal minor. A lot of these office/management talks happens behind closed doors with parents. You can be present, but your parents should be speaking on your behalf and then the school officials do all the work. Your job is to show up and do your assignments. So if she has any questions, she would be directing it to staff/parents. Dont let her wait and direct her to them yourself. Thats within your right. Protect yourself and keep records. Thats improper of them. Make it know that if they wish to discuss organizational topics, that your parents should be the ones inquired and you wont speak without their presence/approval My heart hurts for the family of the poor child that lost his life on a ride in Florida. The workers were negligent and they should be charged to the fullest extent of the law for this. This was so fucking stupid. Comedians shouldnt have to censor themselves- he did his job, joke & present. Will laughing hard at the joke but then going on stage to slap him?? Like? Are you saving face cause the cam caught you or did you see Jada get upset and decided to be macho about it? All of it was so sketch. Chris handled it well. I wouldve started a brawl after seeing him come at me on stage. He also won an award right after and was talking about how love makes you do crazy shit ok sir. Take multiple seats with your toxic ass. Its a shame too cause I actually liked him and his stuff. BRO DEADASS. Take that up with him if youre salty about your wife. Chris ate that slap tho. Held his shit. Not a wince. man said, I wouldve let you dog me if it wasnt for choosing a room with every fucker I know. those are for younger kids cause its easier to press down. I use those when I trim for other people cause it gives me better control, especially if squirmy. I need to chop my hair to rejuvenate and refresh my curls. Its super heavy and long right now both. Sucks to sucks. Thats a huge F and money lost if you leave the class at this time. how did this happen though? werent you given the green light for it? this joke doesnt make sense to me? it would imply youre being aggressive lol Youre Chris Rock. Ayo concert hoes. Anyone ever buy from SeatGeek? Theres some good deals tix for this one artist I want to see but it seems too good to be true good for you! I want to take my chances just because the price is beautiful lol Happy birthday! My boss gave birth to the cutest little baby  She just sent pictures this morning letting us know theyre doing well. I really like this work family Ive been fortunately dropped into @azula I was working when I saw you pinged about Encanto. idk what channel its in but sure. Im not free anytime soon but we can try to find a good date I worked from 7pm to 7am today and now Im going to class. Ill be there til 1pm :))) I rule SPL. People just dont like it  hiii Viv the screenshot doesnt show your response Ive been awake for 35hrs LMAO I have hw due tonight so Ill do it first No, Im ok thank you. I will do my discussion and KO nursing informatics lol  omg time to get on animal crossing and make April themed furniture!! egg time whats wrong with the icon lol my Russian pt wont stop caressing me he keeps running his hands up and down my arms and kissing my hands touched, but also want his grubby hands off. I told the patient to stop, and he would, but then push the boundaries again. He should be discharged before I go back to work so Ill be fine. It happens more often than not. I can request to have a different patient but honestly, if I did that for everyone who made me uncomfortable, Id be with little few people to care for lol my other pt was frustrated and took out his frustrations with another nurse who did me a simple favor literally the shittiest guy ever. I was frustrated I had to stop myself from ripping him a new one. actual POS I have one more humanities to take and the only option that seemed even remotely interesting was History: American Music Theater. I'm going to die. I really hope I'll end up liking it cause if not, those will be a rough 2 months. Short fiction, Modern American History, & Theater History & Appreciation I was doomed for the beginning the other one you mean or the one I chose? Cause the other option sounded better to me but it was from july-august while the one I signed up for is may-july which gives me more summer time off & yeah Kyo, its a special humanities that I need to meet so these fell under it. I wish I couldve taken something else to meet it ily. I dont go back to work until the weekend so a few days off will do me well @red hot silly pepper youre theatrical, do you think the course I chose will be ok? I went on rate my professor and he got good feedback so I hope its fine. The other instructors were rated as strict and with lots of written assignments* feedback was that the professor is fun but super passionate so as long as theres effort, no one fails. my kinda dude lol. the other theater course seemed fun but it was during the middle of summer and I didnt want to lose it Especially with my incoming vaca time Short fiction was the third option but I dont want to write. I like debating and opinions slime it up babe! See, I dont have this problem with nursing courses because its still important and relevant. Anything outside of it has to be to my liking but that makes sense cause I want to take classes I care about Terrible Twos is a thing! Its when theyre most loud, bratty, and tantrums galore. Honestly it will pass but this is the time where firm limit setting is taught so they can learn what you expect from them kids are smart and they know that the louder they get, the more likely theyll get what they want because the parents will do it to shut them I love babies I just witnessed a 13yo ask whats tumblr omfg working shifts without friends is not the vibe I just remember the one time I was at a rehab for my rotation, I was resting against a wall with my foot propped up against it and it was new paint  I moved off when it was time to go to the cafe for lunch and I just heard the paint and plaster unstick off the sole of my shoe and my tiny ass shoe print embedded I was dragging my foot to get rid of the evidence and as I rounded the corner I heard the workers discussing wtf happened to the wall LMAOOOO Y CANTANDO Mando y Viv besando  FRAT QUEJANDO well shit Homie gotta ditch the sesame homeless look I fuck with this development I appreciate he isnt a dreamboat on a kids show my daughter and I shouldnt both be simping  sksjsjsjshs you better send me the deets so I can be your voice of reason cause IYKYK AND I KNOW YOU I dont know how to take this is it a proposition?? I havent spoken to you in weeks and you drop this my guy a mess Yeah I get a bunch too I dont respond lol I get emails hahaha Always a college recruiter I got a fat ass, I cant be stealthy So much is happening Im getting overstimulated gimme a sec to read all this Reading all this makes me uncomfortable cause it seems more like reasons to not breed than serve Cause you know how yt men spent their free time. In all seriousness, I think Id be a badass soldier. Very disrespectful to my commander but good at what I do I thought today was Good Friday so my ass wasnt eating meat & chicken leftovers  I was making an appointment and I looked at the calendar like wtf so now Im gonna eat Buffalo chicken how that's more for fun lol. not something everyone strictly follows but its known like you can just say "oh, it's friday the 13th" and people will joke I work tomorrow so not eating anything within my restrictions is easy, which I am happy about. I barely eat when I work. it does if we want to give all the books a fair chance wtf is a cutie OH THE THE NETFLIX MOVIE ON LITTLE GIRLS WHO DANCED I remember. I saw it I know what the movie is about lol. Happy 4/20 everyone. You know what Ill be doing today  expiring kush in my cars cup holder  from last time I went out I NEED A NEW GRINDER its a mess Really? Ive heard of some good candy ones my coworkers try Yikes NOT MY DAD CASUALLY TELLING ME HE GOT PULLED OVER WHEN I GOT BUDS IN THE CAR LMFAOOOOOO I didnt get to nap during the day, so I am falling asleep at my desk its actual agony we are also short staffed and I want to die I went to work at 7pm and didnt get to take a break until now: its 4am. RIGHT I cant just take one cause I want to, I have to make sure my people wont die on me. I read that as above my fist and I was genuinely worried that you called it your upper arm  the harder you press, the more it seeps so it lasts longer. obviously not too deep cause then its not skin and it fades Both lol Yes. I always wanted to be in one happens when animals dont get the medical attention they need my coworker knows a little Spanish and he is trying to get better so he asks me how to say things and then doesnt like how I phrase it Sir?? Its dialect?? Go ask some Spaniard if youre so nitpicky NO But he says that I dont know how to speak and that its wrong Miss me with that shit Hahahhahahahah ok Bet. No! I remember this was mentioned a while back I feel like Id like it if its funny Thats why I think Id like it, just cause its The Office humor which is  are there a lot of seasons? Tonight is my last night shift for a few days and it was a long time coming lol The acuity on my floor is all-time high and 90% of the population are tempting the grim reaper got a good crew though, so we can suffer together and eat cookies idk if its just an east coast company but theres a place called insomnia cookies and theyre TOO DIE FOR Its basically open all night (thats why its named like that) its college town and bunch of hospitals so they make bank Warm huge and gooey why did that come out so low quality lmfaooo fuck you google oh lord, I literally havent had time off for myself in a while. Im in some weird funk. Hopefully the summer will break me out of it Im dying at that clip that Bel sent btw. People still say this to push the academic agenda (aka have people pay thousands of dollars to get a degree) when it isnt as true today. Experience is first and foremost what people require. Ever wonder why they always ask for all these years of experience when its an entry level job? Because *knowing* is not as important as **doing**. If I have experience, even in something that is a smidge similar to the job Im applying for, I can get it. Why? You need to market yourself and show them what you can bring to the table and why they would be crazy to not go with you. Its worked amazing for me co-signed by a CC grad :) & soon to be private college grad :) :) Hi! Thank you for the well wishes  Very appreciated. Love you all. Thank you! I bought some skincare products just to help my skin out during breakouts and the worker at the door was like good luck with them and remember youre beautiful no matter what I get the sentiment but caring about my skin isnt an insecurity quite a backhanded remark Thank you sooo much  hi babes, thank you so much  ily someone stop me from getting 10 more piercings I will genuinely have 22 if I do but Im obsessed & itching I also want tattoos but this planning aint it. Need to hookup with someone to design them it genuinely didnt help me seeing Jungkook covered in shit. I was doing so good holding back my urges but this man just teasing me my hubby just wants the photos im messing around with piercing filters on Snapchat and eyebrow looks good on me  @rashon24 confirm youd still love me with one look!!! did you see it cause Im deleting  LOL youre right. Its me going for the correction slap & Viv just doing it just cause Vanilla. Absolute cutie. Bless him Viv is a gamer girl luv Nope Yes. Most people will get VIP & use mod. Lu decided to leave hw to last minute and realizing this was a mistake why? Professor is not eloquent nor does his videos have subtitles. Im struggling its a dumb minor for my major, I chose History of American Musical Theater because it worked with my schedule and the professor got good points (reviews) sorry I went to eat lol And Im scrambling to get the work done before my night shift skshsjhsb I will dm you! its my hospital getting an email about monkeypox  I dislike people stating an age is old. If thats how you want to perceive them, go ahead but at least be quiet about it cause why do we need to continue perpetuating this in an already ageist society. you is not specific to you, btw. I see this behavior all the time. quarter-life crisis is a thing, those feelings are normal but it stems from people thinking youth ends once you hit 30s which is false. So many people get their shit together in the midst of adulthood and thats ok. society programs you to think that once youre 18, youre an adult and have to get your shit together. Fake news. most of the people who expect you to have it figured out, arent even there themselves. just do you With what? the way I wouldnt give a damn fuck if the president wanted to drive past me, if I wanna makeout with my man, imma makeout. dont be jealous, I got kisses for you too  if only you could be around 24/7 Shoutout to the cashier at Ulta who didnt scan my most expensive item  Shes a queen Saved me $120. She said here u go bestie The two small ones got paid for, the big one was free. chu know it Some fucking grandpa decided he wanted to park next to me and tried to get in while my door was open. I mean mugged his ass. I love walking out of my floor and passing by my pts rooms and they immediately go for the call light lol Bye homie. just randomly bought tickets to see Halsey tonight lol my niece graduates high school today. my little baby  thank you  Typical age is 17-18. If you want to know how college is going, I just took 16 pages of notes for a quiz with 10 questions. my time limit was 15 minutes and I submitted with 30 seconds to spare. nope. History of the American Musical Theater Look at us being artsy I would honestly be ok with taking chem again in place of this course lol I almost took a short stories and horror media course but they changed the date so I couldnt do it. Course look so much fun. I miss not having minors Minor requirements before anyone freaks out  Staring at my selfies til I go from pretty to ugly sigh lol it sucks being a girl. even when you know youre pretty, you dont *know* you are 100% Approach them Be bold Youd know lol When I renew my license, I have the same questions + specific ones to fill. Its funny Ive never had a problem. Feel like its super easy to tell if youre just familiar with the signs Height, weight, & body proportions (for the most part) dont tell you much. Those can easily be influenced one way or another. Its actual features that will tell you the truth, cosmetic surgery or not. Frown lines, neck, chubby cheeks, callouses etc been MIA but Im officially a week without soda and Im happy with myself @FraternalGemini babe, while I admire your taste, you voted for two sprites so choose one so we can balance the votes accordingly  https://tenor.com/view/miley-cyrus-smile-sassy-wink-batting-eyelashes-gif-3581302 Shes def a stunner! PB did well. monopoly when  Im supposed to sleep so I can do hw tomorrow before my shift Ive been procrastinating so hard and you just temped tf out of me Fine Im convinced. I expect nothing less PLAY fae finna beat your ass when your back I DID IT Full on hiatus for solo work. I really decided to hop on them too late  this was something in the works for a while, even my newbie ass could tell but solo ventures is always fun Not confirmed, besides Jin who is the oldest. They were supposed to be told months ago but no statement was released, and the company even pressed them for an official statement and nothing. The rumor is by the end of this month. but solo is confirmed, which makes enlistment time a good time as ever Yes. You have to enlist by the age of 30. mhm You can now submit as many questions, folks. We just have to approve them in the queue in order to give you more opportunity . So, youre not limited by the skinny you submit (before it was 5), but you are by how many are pending. I will take some time later today and go through them and then you may continue :) The way yall have Sam for being a typical father  Hes written as a traditional man in a household role, when his situation of raising twins without a mother is not. Man is doing fine Not you saying no Fathers Day for him and then admit hes a decent dad lmao I wont stop being risqu me because I have kids. Thats my business and what I do with daddy when theyre not around.. also my business. my mom bought her friend some pride colored cups that were cute for drinking, and she kept getting stares and goes Lu, who do you think theyre assuming you or me? LMAO Clearly you, mom  Aw Kyo! I hope youre doing well and the covid symptoms dont linger. I also demand a cute sushi video where she follows the command Children spill all the tea and I live for it. Share everything they say cause its hilarious Its the infidelity stories for me Child; my mommys boyfriend is in jail but momma is mad cause hes having a baby with another lady Whoever has me on insta and can view my story, youre welcome  Unreasonable coworkers are the worst ONGGGGGG This shit sent  me Guys the funniest thing a happened to me today I was helping a coworker with a patient, since they were getting more increasingly agitated and and an IM med was going to be given but they SNATCHED IT. Uncapped the syringe and threatened us with the needle  The funny thing is I knew it would happen It went from me going should I get security? to CODE PURPLE!!! I want to experience Texas heat I grew up in hot climate lol. Ill be fine On vacation babe! but I will listen to it when Im back Kyo youre not ugly jfc Ive seen you, youre a cutie Easier to keep track of when its select groups. Also brings hype around the event if its exclusive because others will stick around for their shot. Makes you feel important/cool. Many reasons for it. Im like the princess and the pea. Couldnt for the life of me get comfortable in bed until I realized some leftover tag was still attached to my shirt and now that I ripped it off, Im so comfy. Sun baked skin, cool fan, and soft sheets bliss Yes. Depending on your age, you are either 17/18/19 when you graduate. Not sure if everywhere is the same but in the east coast the schools have cut off ages. Meaning if your birthday is at a certain date, you get held back. Im the typical norm where I turned 18 couple of months before I graduated. My friend turned 18 the summer after. Summer babies thrive when it comes to this. winter baby, I literally have to do math to remember my age at a certain point of school year cause I split Some exceptions are made, two people I was friends with were 19 and in my grade class. Everyone made fun of them for being held back when we were younger but its just an unfortunate system Imagine trying to explain to a 12 year old youre a whole year older in the same class because you were held back- not for being stupid but because your parents decided you arent developmentally ready yeah, exactly Im Puerto Rico, 8th grade is considered a grade in high school. So my cousin was in high school, but I was in middle school. Im a month older but he would always feel superior Kids are dumb haha No, of course not. Thats just the default thinking when kids are just spiteful and ignorant. Theres pros and cons to that decision. Just see more cons when it comes to bullying from peers. In MA, cut off for kinder is 6 years old. Other states, its 7 years old. Lets say a kid who parents felt wasnt developmentally ready for kinder until 7 years old moves from their state to MA, now their kid is enrolled in a kindergarten class where the majority of the kids are younger. Since the cut off is just the current age, they could be months shy from turning 8 which causes an even bigger gap. Its how things like that occur. Private schools are more strict about these things but again, parents are the ones who ultimately decide. also, some places dont offer a pre- kinder class, so thats why parents feel like they arent prepared. At 4, I was in a head start class which gauged my readiness and got me used to the system Hiked a mountain in 90 degrees that actually feel like 100 LMAO Oh shit the UV index is 9. I should put on sunscreen cause a bitch is gonna burn I know how this sounds but I promise Viv did not meet me. omg I love you That would be such chaos and I promise you that Viv would end up heartbroken. https://tenor.com/view/twitch-swiftmo-dialjess-club-mesh-spank-gif-18672943 I love you too babes! Miss you. Having the best time  My family some days, me, myself and I most days Hahahah! I love pantless kids cause re-dressing them is an entire mission! The bribery helps If you keep your damn shorts on you can have ice cream! If you take that the wrong way, thats on you lmao. some would argue I already am one aka my nieces and nephews and cousins phew. I got a farm anymore dirty secrets they shared? RIGHT I like when they trip after waddlig around like wtf did you expect  Timmy? Its so bad when you laugh cause its a green light and they keep going Then its like day 7 of hearing then scream balls Its good to laugh when they fall because they will most likely not cry I love when they whip their heads to you and gauge your reaction I visited my friend at her daycare job and watched a kid get slapped across the face by another just for stealing a single grape it was a green grape probs justified ngl Imagine if it was a Dino nuggie apocalypse Proud of you I like assholes playboys but that doesnt mean theyre right for me lol. If youre trying to have fun, go have it but make sure its not at your expense. If youre trying for something serious, then make sure both of you agree its to not play around but that doesnt mean youll go 180mph into a relationship. take your time to learn about each other and learn what you like in your partners, thats what dating is. I think dating involves multiple people but sometimes others dont agree, so thats a good convo point. Idk, the beginning of dating is kinda iffy cause some people just go straight into praise and doting, which others like but it doesnt sit well with me. Show me that you like me and that youre interested but dont be in my space 24/7 or have the world revolve around me. Thats not cool. It needs to be more natural and it seems like youre being a little nervous by asking for opinions which makes me think youre not 100% there oh so then wtf girl. Either make it more or quit it. :) Listen, Ive gotten close with those kinds of guys. Sometimes I break it cause I knew it was bad or I broke it cause they were on my nerves. He knows you got feelings, men like to play dumb but arent as dumb as they are clever. Tell him you want to exclusively date or cut down how often you see him. I feel like Im missing a lot rn. Ive been close with those buddies? Like to the point where we did dates and stuff, because the companionship is nice. But as long as youre both not struggling with feelings. FWB to me doesnt have to just be about bouncing in bed but that also doesnt mean it works for others. I do think youre both rebounding and just filling in the missing spot for your exes which is really bad Thats bad coping girly First one in 10 years and all you guys are going through some kind of crisis Lmao Rebounding is molding someone into what you arent able to get over. Companionship is just a friendship where you both relate to each other and thats both individually and together. is he though? Tell me whats good about him. This sounded way more cunt-y than I intended but still stands haha Everyone is great until they arent  This means hes a good man, which is ok babe. Its good that hes a decent guy but that doesnt mean hes a good partner. Those two arent mutually exclusive Ill give you a good example My sisters ex. Hes the baby daddy. He is a wonderful father, dotes on the kids and buys them all the new stuff that they want. Hes lighthearted and humorous. Stable job. Everything you want in a man? He wasnt a good partner for her. He was jealous and paranoid. Always worried about cheating. Didnt like that she had male friends and how flirty she would be, even though it was a charm he liked before they got together. See how you can be one and not the other? There was a bed bouncing story time? Damn I missed everything. Anyways You just described a decent guy. Doing decent things. Nothing astronomical while it was nice and pleasant since you went through a breakup but basic stuff wont be good forever. so take it easy, take a step back if you need it, have fun with others on dates and see why this one is good while the other isnt. Shop around. have you hung out with his friends? Him with yours? those are important things Age differences arent easy even though theyre hot and fun and new. Ive done my fair share older men and let me tell you. Toxic yeah, they got experiences and stability. but then ask yourself why is this man with a young adult who is just learning about the world. So whats wrong with you that people your age dont want you? They know so much more than what you know, so its easy to manipulate. Ive had a man be jealous I spent time in school, working, with my friends and that I didnt spend enough time with him. Even if it was in bed. Why? Because he did all that already while I havent Ill be honest. Doctors arent it. Theyre cocky, manipulative, savior complex, etc. theyre used to talking and being heard and followed. They work long ass hours so they wont be around as often and when they are around, they dont have much energy to do much. Trust me. I talk about how hot and cool they are, which is true but dating someone in my career isnt the brightest idea. Look at the videos of married doctors and see how they spend time with each other grabbing lunch for their breaks. Thats reality. All about saving and little about you Yeah super unhealthy. I told you about my first code where I burst into tears in frustration, went to the bathroom, rinsed my face off and went about the rest of my 3hrs of work like nothing happened because I needed to be there for the other 5 patients. oh we smoke and drink. A lot. Literally dont even change our scrubs and go to bars Go to the bars in a medical city like Boston. Scrubs Everywhere The smoking is literally for stress and to give yourself breaks. Lmao. Also a lot of medical professionals dont believe in COVID btw. You had a bad experience with lasting effects. Just a warning. It means they died and we had to do CPR I only cried because the doctor who I kept alerting that something was wrong didnt respond to me until I called the code which means all hands on deck to revive he sprinted up the stairs because he knew he fucked up. I shouldve reported him tbh. I can tell people enough stories as to why being a nurse is hard, tears in my eyes of the sad moments but Ill still smile and pull on my scrubs the next day for my shift. Its not for everyone. Weve had incidences where the codes happen in front of a family member. We quite literally revive them right in front of their eyes. Hearing them crying in the background while youre just trying to feel a pulse come back. its traumatic for many. Theres so many researches of PTSD in medical professionals, now more than ever post-COVID Honestly, not like the movies where they lunge in. Thats pretty hard to do when youre shell-shocked and we crowd the room since its quite literally like 20 of us responding. We usually have someone pull them away if it isnt too serious or if theyre about to pass out but mostly keep them there. It helps them in the long run see all of us doing our best to fight for their lives. It helps with their coping that they witnessed everything it took One of my floor techs (assistants) got urine tossed on her by a patient. My other patient was kind to me but then flung poop at the night nurse. Ive been threatened by patients. I sometimes have prisoners restrained and with 3 guards at the bed when I care for them. People are assholes. I have to ask them to open their mouths or else theyre pocketing their pills. We had a patient who was severe heart failure have water shut off in their bedside sink because they wouldnt stop drinking water we would stop bringing in cups but the weight kept going up so we realized it was because of that No, I can send you my email for this week that shows we need a nurse for every shift this month. A lot of medical staff left after being burnt out from COVID. Because of unfair wages and treatment. Because mandated vaccinations. Its a selfless job and it tests your patience everyday. I have family tell me in such a bitch with no patience and its true, it takes so much out of me to be kind and helpful to 50 people for 12hrs in a day that when I get home, Im easily annoyed. Once Im absolutely done with hospitals, Id be a school nurse or work in a doctors office. Its mundane and less stress. but I like the adrenaline run and knowing so much because I see different things everyday We have monkey pox in my hospital. you lose those skills and knowledge with places outside of hospitals so its a win-lose Yeah, the girl was a G for the way she handled it. Guess who cut her hair it went snip snip bye bye Oh I can already tell where this is going Youre not my doctor
Im leaving AMA
Youre just a nurse
Fuck you or Go to hell Im calling the cops! Is my favorite. Always about being kidnapped or held against their will lol couple dogs is a no no babe its messy I wouldnt say climate change is the cause for a heatwave hitting the typical places at this time of the year This is typical stuff. Anyways, Im at an outdoors concert and slowly getting slushed on nothing but spiked pia coladas :( you both deserve better so he wants a corgi? If he got the funds than idk why this is a problem or is he asking for what breeds are good? To be quite honest, most pets are needy cause they depend on you. If he wants a self sufficient pet, cats and fishes are the way to go. Dogs are too lovable and need companions to be left alone for long days Its why I havent committed to adopting one. I wouldnt be able to give them a proper home and love Which movie Tell me the name lol LMFAO The JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE ONE? dear lord well thats not shocking at all Ive watched it. It was ok, not great or anything. Love the Ashton Kutcher one more I just woke up after working 12hrs after arriving from PR and need to get my bearings together or else I would watch it with you Not without me hoe I guess I wont be picking up tonight lmao They asked me to pick a shift tonight cause I worked last night and someone called out Im a rotten liar and I picked up tonight to get tomorrow night off so no movies for me! @azula We have an 18+ channel for a reason babe! Trying to keep peoples purity intact Yes Not a fella, but I have. Im so bloated omg. Feel like a cow. B I like how its not even comparable cause it has more variety than the other rows lol Yes Lu packing for her trip: everything short, black & tight. Chicago! neither girl lmao where did this come from lmao did I miss the joke? I would like to announce that my ass is huge. Swimming for me Total body workout Im watching the videos from Lolla and I really fought my way past kpop girls just to get a good view for idols whose music I dont even like  I remember mentioning I was in Chicago on here lol! Thats why I was there :) got some vids of TXT & J-Hope for my cousin Oh Ill share with you  its Lu having money cause she slaves every day at work for me  I took two vacations, and one of them was approved and the other was convenience. Boss bitch I dont get the problem, if this is the usual, just follow the rules. You arent used to it but youre going to learn if you want to attend lol Thats not the norm where Im from, but if I traveled and went to school in a place where it is, no exception will be granted for me unless medically excused. Totally agree! I watched it with my sister cause people said it was a good angst movie and I was just not interested Ive watched better If he loves this song, bring him to be soon so I can teach him to dance to salsa  Hi! How are you?  Just getting ready to work tonight, otherwise ok! Thank you for asking babe I HAVE TEARS IN MY EYES someone told me I look shorter than 5ft and I was like no! I swear Im not, and then they measured me Im not 5ft  Im just under 59in I WISH. My ass stomped over to the stand trying to prove them wrong and I looked like a fool https://tenor.com/view/peace-tayo-hambles-peace-sainyo-peace-mga-kapatid-peace-lang-gif-22009840 My hypoxic patient cause the ICU resident thinks hes ok to stay on my floor dont confuse hypoxemia with hypoxia! if youre checking SPO2, thats the blood concentration so anything like a asthma attack or COPD exacerbation can cause that but once it reaches the tissues, youll see the big mess. youd be surprised what people walk around with just for blatant ignorance or being uneducated. Not a course lol. Im a nurse and Firework is interning as a doctor :) Before licensing, we need to work/study at different areas like doctors office or hospitals to get an idea of how it works. Which is what she was referring to There is a mass hacking going on in the kpop world. WILD @kyo how you feeling about V (BTS) and Jennie (BP) dating? lmao the leaked photos are sending me they look cute but she rubs me the wrong way, whether its actually her or her persona is to be debatd YOU DON'T KNOW??? bro its everywhere she's been hacked through her friend's I love drama. any drama and I am there @kyo In order of leaks. They went for Jimins friend too. He deactivated after two of the photos got out of them hanging out and my cousin is in shambles because they caught Jake (Enhypen) trying to pick up girls By asking them for some cigs Lol, they arent doctored. They were caught in Jeju before this mess too Do I think theyre dating? Nah. Maybe just FWB but theyre together and fans hate it. kpop tea is fun. brings me back to the 5sos days the easiest boys to get, I swear. still got Ashton on snapchat. still laugh at my dm's with his buddy Jack Barakat too 100% my friend's and I are still talked about til this day. Me for being a "groupie", and her for being the reason Luke got exposed for cheating on his psycho gf at the time a duo I tell you are you actually trying to study or Then you can say I wear you! Thats my fave perfume Black Opium!! my other go-to is Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana Yup! All the time my patients compliment me at the hospital haha. You smell delightful giving me a big head I need to smell yours. Dont think Ive tried it Two of my courses opened today, both of them being requirements for my major, and holy fuck is that a lot of assignments due this week. Lmao, bye bye life. Totally random, but despite not being at my goal weight,  my side profile still rocks HELP.
My next schedule period has me as the floor manager for 4/6 of my shifts. FOR THE TWO WEEKS. why do they hate me (read: trust) so damn much??? @kyo if I moved to Cali, I would be your manager :P I get a bonus for it but its not worth the $3. Give me $10 at least My handwriting is pretty Ill send you a picture of my notes without all the information I used to do half cursive, but I fixed that and now just do regular print why are my door dashers always male? Sometimes a girl just wants to grab her wine and pizza braless :( they really are but they arent cute :( I dont like them leaving food on the ground lmao. If I had something outside like a shelf or patio I would Im a good tipper. I tip to people what I wish I got tipped at work lmao Im not allowed to accept money and trust me, it hurts my soul when someone offers me $50 for the good care Ive given I just texted someone for the first time and forgot to say its me lmaoooo they literally went wow thats so sweet, who are you? I wanna save your number  Nah, a lot of them are like that. Dont like their time to be wasted and enjoy knowing theyre the smartest. Lots of doctors are narcissists With a superior complex Some are so deluded they think theyre God Nursing professors are demons too. Mines lived by the phrase this program will be hell so the tests looks easy in comparison Like maam? No point was made haha Doctors are adults. Of course we swear they talk badly to the coworkers some times and I get in their face telling them to chill tf out What youre not gonna do is flaunt your little degree and make MY staff feel inferior. Fuck off. LOL Yeah, I know some people in that field and theyre chill asf Dont think doctors are special. They are literally just another frat bro tbh Just more brains (usually) I like them too but doesnt mean little peepee gets a free pass. Dating a doctor sucks. Go for a legit one and you will hate it unless youre ok sitting alone in a decent house and maybe have some stuff paid for That frat wouldve been ashes over here lol Rashon gotta start posting on snap more I want to witness the debauchery When youre the nurse manager last night and I have to call security because your pt is physically and verbally abusive. Then your other pt goes into respiratory distress all before midnight.  Theres a hurricane hitting Puerto Rico. Just got off the phone with my dad who is stuck there until it passes cause all flights are cancelled til the end of the month :( Thank you! Spoke to him today before it hit but obviously going to worry until it settles @kyo Im trying to get Enhypen tix and I respect the amount of money you dropped for your girlies. Im really trying to not do it but. I just might go for it. LIT Do it again haha The concert is on one of the guys birthday so it boutta be lit I wouldnt be mad at spending the money if it was near me but Ill have to pay for hotel and gas and all that shit. so.  I genuinely was gonna say its Hees birthday thinking youd know but I didnt want to out myself like that  WAIT DO YOU WORK TODAY?! Lets play a fun game of who do we think Lu biases? On VC. Warning: I dont bias anyone. I rather die than use that term but we can pretend we EW THEYRE SO HOT AND TALENTED. Listen I cry knowing I couldve been in Jimins pants back in 2017 had I bothered to give them a chances No one corrected me when I thought they were all younger and fruitier. They just needed to show me their tats and bodies and I wouldve been sold LMAOOOOO I was adamant on withholding from them only for carpool karaoke to ruin me I must be updated when you get the chance no, like when youre free. Doesnt have to be today tbh  Frat really came into the conversation about kpop just to fangirl over ggs. come to my side pls  omg I love it! Thanks!
