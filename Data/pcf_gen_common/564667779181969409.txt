Hello! I've been wanting to join a choices discord for a while but could never find one so hi Finally somewhere i can rant about my favorite game and people wont be confused asf Yeeeeee Thx! @Rei likes pathetic men come over here I aspire to watch as many animes as yiu You* Ohh Hey r u caught up on MHA? Yea i mena the anime Us MHA fans get that and BB all at once üòà Two days later: MHA NEEDS TO UPDATE DAFUQ Ok ill check them iut üëè  START IT Forget everything else in life start season 4 Lmao K i gtg get in da shower Because ...school Ok Brb in like 10-20 minutes so now whatchu guys wanna talk abt oh wait so do you guys know My Hero Academia? if u dont its fine what lol no its a show anime* yea you should watch it its one of the best animes out there imo but anyways so my fave character is this guy named Bakugo lol and theres also this manga artist i watch called Talart i have never heard of any of those lol ok so i ended up donating to the artist while she was livestreaming nooo i only watch two animes subbed lol aight i was gonna tell a small story but weve moved on lol actually im learning Japanese so watching subbed is helpful to me but i watch dubbed cause im pretty lazy exactly the only anime i watch subbed is Food Wars lol also Food Wars is really weird same jinx lol wait people demonitize dub watchers boi yes, apparently man people are messed up yea ive realized the best media alwas have the most toxic fandoms lol same i mean, the Choices fandom is mostly good but theres a lot of crap that happens and we aint even gonna talk about the homophobic crap pb pulls sometimes example: that time in Bloodbound when we went to.. i think it was Vegas and we took Jax and Adrain but not Kamilah or Lily sorry that was late oh boy lololol im not even lesbian and i know thats just no yea are you interested in people of the same sex ok thats better wording . yes pls i love how we started talking abt Johnny Depp and now were helping someone find their sexuality yea if you end up being lgbtq it just comes naturally yea just... tell them when ur ready. Sit them on the couch and tell them. If they disagree then thats too bad its their loss the whole point of marriage is love tho yea like, marrying someone you actually love is so much better than marrying someones whos basically a stranger @DaHomieDrew thats true some times actually i believe its the opposite true isnt that illegal oh wait nvm yeah i forgot abt that hm okay look. Some arranged marriages work out sometimes, as seen with @azula's grandparents. But it tends not to work, especially with large age gaps. In my opinion, if you love and respect them, and ur in an arranged relationship, go ahead with it. If not, dont marry them. If ur forced to then.. try to get a divorce. or make a mutual agreement about not really being in a relationship. i dont have any experience with this but thats what i think. ah ok pretty good oof im gonna draw some BakuDeku art hehehehhe cool yo isnt that a bot how did it know to jesus wait so did the word cool trigger it to say "cool cool cool" cool lol true so now what do u guys wanna talk abt is anyone here an artist? oh ok bye the pokemon tcg or the video games i got to stay home heh a year? yo same im a manga artist mostly lol same did you draw ur pfp? oh ok would you wanna show us something you did draw? ok i could post some of mine of yall r interestesed interested* aight lemme go get my sketchbook also: i dont color that much but my friend got me some fine tips for christmas so i used them here thats why the color is so bad lol\ ah k aight i posted it decided not to do the colored one it kinda looks weird i can still share if you want it tho yea also a perfect circle tends to not be needed in most art pieces i think we can all agree that math is evil wait what why whatd he do tho oh ok understandable nooooo no maths yes yall lets stop talking bout math so anybody enamored with Japan cause i am and no, its not because of anime Japan is a really interesting place ok did everyone leave ok im just gonna hover around waiting for someone to say some crap lol ooo thats cool what was it like there yeah totally... agree... *googles infrastructure definition* yeah i read something about that ones once* the thing said if a train was an hour late it could make the newspaper lololol big oof BIGGER OOF EVEN BIGGER OOF LOL ok thats not that bad unless ur insecure, in that case, YOU ARE PRETTY OK lol i think i might snore but idk same oof i almost misread "almighty" for "All Might" lol k im gonna go play scribbl.io anyone wanna play with me same i havnt read it *le gasp* happy birthday boi cool boi ok this is mah friend who kinda like the game he didnt read the rules uh i think he mightve left a few times idk so anyone wanna talk im kinda bored lol same so what *are* we gonna talk abt Wait so do we use the #color-role-channel  thing in the #robo-lab-bots Are you allowed to type there Oof XD Oh yeah blue username baby Thx Soooo anyone bored Im kinda just sitting here waiting for someone to do something Freaking same Unless its something i know nothing abt Cause then ill just end up lookin like an idiot Nice I get a four day weekend but i dont remember why Something abt president's birthdays being on Monday's idk Idek Yeah im just gonna not question it and be happy abt the 4 dat weekend Oof So r we still gonna argue abt anime or what Ok lets just agree to disagree I couldnt give a crap abt race its abt interests imo Uh So can we not talk abt that anymore Whos thomas ...

Oh ok Christmas for me is gifts and celebrating Jesus' birth Nice Jinx Ehhehehe Oof Am i the only one still at school atm? I think so actually I haven't played it in a while so Pompeii was this volcano that killed peoples Thats the gist of it A what now I thought Pompeii was the volcano that destroyed the villiage I think the first time i actually heard of Pompeii was in a Magic Treehouse book No I haven't It doesnt really have any flavor or anything Its just a disk if flour or somethong Yeah it can be wheat too I doubt im gonna even remember this but i might try it at some point I dont have that good of a memory lol Tortillas are used for burritos Oh ok then Soo wanna see something totally unrelated to what we're talking about? I finished one of my lesson... things today Yeah Do you use it? Im learning Japanese Did you finish learning it? I believe ya It looks complicated at hecc For learning an entirely new language, id day thats pretty good So i cant relate cause im not even in high school yet, but that all sounds pretty interesting for school grades 6th grade in my district is still elementary for some reason Oh really Here i have like... E, S, and some others i think Heh, ES Cool I forgot abt that thing lul My mom doesnt really talk abt her grades and stuff, and i dont live with my dad but i remember he was really good at math Ah Actually i dont know what im gonna study either but im nowhere near college yet Though itll prob have to do with art Really?

Hmm Wanna talk about theories abt the world Like is a black hole one sided? Yeah, science is my 2nd favorite subject Art What about you? So technically also science Just a different type I've never really messed with either My favorite science is definitely space 6th And im in the one district where 6th is elementary.. 7th and 8th i think After that its high school Yeah I actually recently moved so when i saw 6th was still elementary i was kinda shocked at first Where i live atm, we have preschool, 1st - 6th is elememtary, 7th - 8th is middle, 9th - 12th is high, then college From nursery to 12th?

Unless i suddenly grow an aching need to have my chest be flat as a door Which i do periodically get sometimes but its not constant Holy shit I forgot how much surgeries cost Wow Discord is an ass sometimes lmao Ohh thats interesting, i actually didnt know there were different types like that I think my most euphoric experience was when one of the staff at school called me he bc i was wearing baggy clothes and most of my face was covered They what now Do binders hurt? Im kind of considering maybe getting one but they look a bit painful As if i would have the motivation to exercise In an alternate universe mayhaps Ive mostly been fine as long as im wearing some kind of bra but i kind of want to see if binders will feel any better Do you have any sites or anything youd recommend buying binders from? Wait no viv you go first lmao sorry Wait is she ftm or mtf then? Oh okay lmao Personally i think it was fine? Especially if she didnt know she was trans before they got together but even if she did know i still think its okay. If the fiance reacted as if it was some major betrayal instead of like,, their spouse is growing and becoming who she truly is then i probably wouldve called it off tbh Did the youtuber already know they were trans like way before she told the fiance or? Or like did she figure it out while they were together There is still adoption too if they want a kid that badly Is there a reason for that? Besides just like,, some feeling that i dont think ill ever really understand From the pov of someone who doesnt really want kids at all there doesnt seem to be a significant difference between biological and adopted kids except for genetics and physical appearance. Its still a tiny human being you get to love and care for right? So its like a feeling that its more connected to you than an adopted child? Oh i can attest to this, my mom is extroverted and im introverted as all hell So its less connecting emotionally is the problem but more like,, spiritually? Thats not the word im looking for fuck uhhhhh what was it Whenever i played house i would always voluntarily be the fucking dog lmao IM SERIOUS I WAS COMPLETELY CONTENT WITH JUST BEING A DOG FOR THE ENTIRETY OF RECESS What did you think i said lmao WH ADAM NO DHKDHDJKHK WE WERE LIKE 5 YEARS OLD PLS Whenever i played family i would just walk around on all fours barking rip ~~How did i never see that as a sign that i was gonna end up being a gd furry~~ Ive had this conversation but with movie characters in very specific circumstances so i dont think i can say i fully argument either side properly at this point hdkkdhkhjkd Does it have any genetic relation at all? I mean i wouldnt think so but Oh if its focused with the context of the nature vs nurture debate then thats different This is like the most ive talked in this server in years hhskkjklh And its about science i dont even fully understand rip MURDER GENE Can i have one I have no idea what its referencing i just want a murder gene I didnt even know that was a thing Its probably just some type of coincidence tbh Well i mean we could take zodiacs and space stuff into account? What zodiac is born in november I think i match up with mine pretty well? Im a taurus for context I think i really only talk about zodiacs in the context of like those zodiac memes or to see if people match with the general traits or not. Its never had any say in any type of decision ive made, im just interested bc i like space n stuff hkjhjhd I still dont know what my MBTI is lmao I went to take a quiz on it but it was like 30 questions long and i was tired And i didnt even know how to answer half of them rip Uh what is da big 5 ive never heard of it lmao Did mine Ive been summoned whos the milf :poppydealwithit: :poppydealwithit: :poppydealwithit: hop You can have two but i think logging in and out is the only way to switch them ^^ **WHAT** :YellingWoman: OH MY GOD NOT YOU TOO JESUS CHRIST THE AUDACITY *w h a t* HUH WHO SUMMONED ME Is lu an incredibly handsome master of all villainy Alright i can accept this then If you truly are megamind please expect constant marriage proposals Wait what is lyme disease Is it deadly?

I think thats what happened in the one i watched Oh yep i just looked it up its the same one I have seen it before but i dont really remembee anything from it because it was mainly just pkaying in the background lmao Hate the fact i would probably unironically listen to this for like 5 minutes God i keep forgetting squidward is not, in fact, a squid Who thought that was a good idea nO WE LOST THE SCREAMING LADY ^^^ asking this too bc im confused Sup god I am always present at the most inopportune times Also ollo Whats up hdkdjj Felt HAP BIRDAY America,, core?
