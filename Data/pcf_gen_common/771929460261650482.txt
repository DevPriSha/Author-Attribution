Heyy Yeah we just created it a couple of weeks ago💀🤦‍♀️ Take care @kyo Thanks kyo <3 Thanks!! Thanx! 💀💀💀 Cuz that's entertainment for some Mygoshh 👀👀 whaaaaa- Did they hack or something? Confession pages are super creepy I DID I have 6 And we talk like literally every single hour Vhgv I met all of them while we were pranking someone Ngl I liked high school Fkgngvjhcdshku sounds great This line reminded me of an incident........ A friend of mine drew a nude sketch during maths lesson.........
......he got caught by the teacher He was literally sitting next to me and I had no freakin' clue I'm friends with people from pre school, people from middle school and people from high school ..*not junior school* All this talk about friends and now I feel nostalgic KIRBY BUCKETS!? I had to attend 3 zoom funerals in the past month and- ....me who celebrated her birthday too thru zoom Awwwwe🥺 All of us cut the cake at the same time, all of us played dress up and fashion show, all of us jammed to the same songs at the same time What sucked was the fact that we had planned a huge party at a club 💀 *ouch You could have sneaked it in... Omigod 😂😂 .......I did that for my bf once Some idiot posted it on insta and tagged the school's official insta handle si we got caught Aww that's sweet 💀💀 wow Like a wine 🍷 Everything happens for a reason Lmao I'm short too That's for a reason too See now I'm in a philosophical mode See I just had a drink so I'm philosophical You're lucky no hangovers I blame *medusa* That's something written on this can You're welx Chfvhg forgive medusa not me Fhgv y'all were like so chill when I drunk texted y'all The next day when I went through then u was like whaaaa- You killed medusa now Waiit no I killed the can 💀 I feel like I'm in endless summer That one scene from which I had to watch a dozen playthroughs to get out of Is it a sad song Lowkey feel like being sad now That motivational I want sad songs so now I'm holding this pain ......felt I lovve pain They are Super super duper annoying That's me and my bro Ugggh that situation Me and my brother literally have this every other day used to get messy like crazy but now what we do is whenev this happens we either go out for a drive or binge something instead of fighting We like had a talk about our different tastes and stuff then we started to divert ourselves from that situation once we cleared up the differences "After death philosophy acc to Islam"

..... I don't follow any religion so idk about this but seems interesting.. Terrorism and Islam....... It sure is a pretty *controversial* topic Restrictions for women in Islam? Cuz almost every religion has those I think Islam might have those too Only female mosquitoes have the apparatus to suck blood But it's difficult to identify whether it's male or female by just looking at a flying mosquito lol Mosquitoes never bite me💀 I literally don't do anything they've just never bothered me 😂 ..I do Check if you made any mistake in the code Then there's defo something missing in it Which one did you use? Try DMing this person Can you send me the ss of the code which you used? First log out of your account and then log back in, try it again. Sometimes Tumblr screws up stuff
If this doesn't work then DM that person and ask them Since it's their code Once while using HTML in Tumblr I had the same problem Then it worked after a few hours Cuz Tumblr screws up everything even a simple post or reblog Tumblr screwed up You're welcome:) I don't get those families and relatives who freak out on such stuff; mine literally made me sit down and gave a whole ass speech about how I should not hide if I am i think it depends on whether they're open minded or not My family's like do whatev you want we don't give a fuck just remember to show up at vacations, birthdays, parties and get togethers They literally drag me out of the door...................... . I have to wait 4 months for a license 💀 the DREAM Happy birthday @azula !! RIP your photoreceptors Reason- I kicked him out of csyp mod team And he's blowing up everywhere Just ignore for some time- I personally have no regrets That's my choices server That's a good summary ngl Happy birthday drew🥳 this one wasn't an alternate account not a creep a mf creep just did but it doesn't matter cuz he always admits, confesses, apologizes then comes back with a fake acc or identity you ain't seen anything yet lol He has even threatened to commit suicide in another server of mine he threatened to kill a ||puppy|| who's the admin of this server? Okie thanks No it's about that zeke drama there's a list of alt acc that I think everyone should be informed about Besides that person isn't actually named ezekial he's a she Because there are many others who stream/create content like podcasts, videos etc. There's nothing wrong with them shouting out kat but it's also kinda sketchy that they didn't seem to notice all this earlier. Also kinda unfair too Many do Cuz I have talked to the other people who do that and they all have tried <atleast once> to get a shout out from pb Personally haven't watched Kat's content but I have heard pretty good feedback about it As someone who has a lot of dead servers, I'd say that that does help but only for a day or two. Basically 
#1 You've gotta be active and on a kind of "texting streak" 
#2 You've got to know how to keep a texting convo running
#3 Trying to make new members feel welcome, sometimes they don't mix in And also new ideas and something new that sets your server apart from the others because there are a lot of servers for just one topic I don't think people mind being pinged for welcoming (?).... Same lol I recognise that book LMAO 
I just can't figure out what it was called I remember imprinting this para in my brain Physics sucks I have a test in 4 days and I feel like I know nothing in physics atleast Thanks!! Pancake same lol it was boring af but easy to remember when understood once I'm literally getting confused with every server which ones which lol Lmao I swear everytime reading texts on this server is like a hilarious novel 😂 I've never used tiktok and have always been curious bout the hype around it And then it got banned 🚫 Vjgjgvhv I'm in a wierd place stuck between all 5 of them I've never used snap too All ik is that there a wierd dog filters 😂 This reminded me of finding Pokemons on Pokemon go I stopped playing it after a while but I think it got banned here along with tiktok There was a talking tom too right? I thought about trying out those apps again a few weeks ago and found that there's a talking hank, a talking Ben and many others I made flappy bird in java cuz my ipad broke while playing that- Y'all can't believe it's been five years here I can't believe it's been 18 years of me surviving 💀 Lmao same How This is bad My whatsapp worked for a min or two too but then went down again Someone hacked fb I'm 60% sure Jinx 🍾🍾 better I got champagne Idk why Tumblr suddenly started sending me a dozen notifs- ...they're cute ..demm btw heyaa ppl wazzup same just finishin' up assignments oooh that's defoo interesting ..i wish i had a course containing anatomy lol
