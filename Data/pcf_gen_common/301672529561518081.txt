It's normal Except one thing He made uberbot saying pervert thing And as "Kaitlyn" he keeps talking about cupcakke Google it She sings NSFW songs I am in the server because besides Feenie it's good There are more places to talk about choices lol google translate claims that preach is reading of a command stupid translate Still Translate sucks Han 😢 I want to think so 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 True She looks a bit like Jocelyn oh also i will download mass effect after i have to go soon there is 25% chance i forgive nathan but never be his friend depends on my emotions 😂 🤔 they look similiar both named Nathan and both villains maybe that's where pb got the idea for Nathan he is villain for working for Jefferson jefferson is the big bad why? i don't know the game https://www.tenor.co/vxuu.gif i won't buy mass effect i will download them seperately what do you mean i just started downloading mass effect 1 i won't buy them i will get it with all dlcs Wow some people have it people for honor is for free in steam it's for limited time tomorrow i am on code challenge 😬 seriously i am contacting viv to disable everyone Wait wtf? At least you are back Oh wait Don't mind me I stay there for more choices discussions Let's not forget the admin quiz He made basically 3 rounds First was about him Second was about his choices preferences Third was cooking Yes There are people that go for choices content The new people That's true Me too But there are still discussions And I want as much as more Well more easy for him Less ways he to get exposed He keeps me because he can't find fake reason to ban me I hope the people from there go here And the thing with two choices servers Yep I will pm them So Feenie doesn't make drama I will Invite Fandom disaster Dono the other Quinn One another active user there We could invite Sisi! Not your virtual beastie But Dono for sure Yvb? Who is that He will read this chat Let me find invite link What about sisi There is admin role The way people know who is admin Well he tried to have fun By causing drama The almost whole time He basically faked a cousin in his account so he has more fun He faked being stabbed and his cousin replacing him for a while A lot things point to it Some people here were friends with him for a year Tell her a word to search with Hmmm It continues 2 hours It's OK @azula I don't think anyone believes him anymore you have been in the server @azula ? it has been always about him He haves problems like Fearless Diva It does i heard about the server from the reddit post that calls out feenie's server in the comments there is a link yes @Pardy made it (thank you I hope it worked) Me too @azula the post was actually somewhere around when i joined the server somewhere around July 22 Has at least one heart? Wtf is that supposed to mean???? lol .userinfo ❤ basically my favorite ❤ hmmm @Williukea is that you? @Pardy yep it was yours and yes hopefully it works with the new post Nope he wasn't banned He left it doesn't feel like the other choices server anymore tbh it becomes less and less choices content there People have to know who feenie is. If they saw all of this and want to be friend with him, they are welcome to. This is from experience as viv said. Even new members of his server can see that the server is becoming based on him. I did not call him that, but you make it look like all of us did rn. I am not one of those who heard it just to say. @azula pokecord always sends messages like level up but you already limited it to only this new pokemons will appear at #deleted-channel only wow ...

Why did they do that though what's the point to do it at all the fuck I don't see a joke here wtf If that server wasn't deleted I would raid it I don't see joking too and look how they hide their own nicknames They created the whole problem! @Deleted User ^ So what I am sexist?? I am sexist for hating Alana then I hate Teagan too Oh my god I am so sexist This doesn't even make sense faith in humanity = -99999 that's why I am a dog and I am sexist for hating Alana and Teagan also I hate zeke @Raven 3 Skye's server right I didn't even knew who he was Blight seemed like a cool person before I knew about it now: 🤢 oh no I am sexist now I offended his/her gender 😢 You are sexist to boys @Raven 3 😡 You hate your own gender that's **not** sexist at all @Deleted User yes to females that means you hate your own gender so based on what they said i am racist and sexist perfect Because I made white Adrian and because I hate Teagan and Alana @Deleted User did you pick a white customizable character? @Deleted User you may or may not be racist @Dono racist af what did black people do to you @Dono @Deleted User lol so true I don't get why do they bring so much hate on Hilda 🤔 I don't condone any discriminating it's stupid i wish everyone who is discriminating someone to understand how stupid they are i am following only two people ^ https://giphy.com/gifs/vk7VesvyZEwuI wow look at the notes when did the fandom got *that* toxic 🤦 Congrats I think? Yay Having a problems with your eyes doesn't make you nerd That's another thing I hate in the community Having glasses makes you look like nerd Even though you have actual problems with seeing Faith in humanity lost to extreme level Oh so you don't have problems with your eyes? 👍 Do better than what I mean he did use the sentence in ~~text like that~~ So I just thought that he might use eyes that aren't for your seeing Telltale 😭 😭 ~~your dad reminds me of my dad~~ Well his priority is always him He cares more about himself than other people He is lying and for the little thing Alcoholic he never actually did something for me he wants *me* to do things for him @Dono I don't know But it's not like I could go ask him directly also he doesn't care for my mother's health he has the balls to think that my mother is faking her illness Even thought we have been going through hospitals and we know @Dono My mother isn't like that but my alive grandpa (from my father's side 🙄) and father think so He is a cook And even after that yesterday he asked for help because he is lazy what he likes is to lie on the couch and be on his laptop Also another thing I hate for my father 96% of his promises are fake so I don't believe almost everything he says also what I hate is that how much calm he is in situations that he fucked up My father lies a lot too also another thing that my father does: He does everything in the last moment like he prepares for job literally 10 mins before it's time for job and he is always late I don't know how his bosses handle him Seriously he needs around 10 mins to get to work But he prepares 10 mins before it Sadly, my mother is very forgiving my grandma (thank god) dislikes him because he isn't serious about anything Same my father forgets literally everything like we and my mother went out to shop and got home at lunch and the evening he says yesterday 🤦 Also he is very slow I bet because of the alcohol And if I do him a favor He was never thankful He never shows any emotion Not mine I don't plan to drink alcohol in the future I don't want to become my father I am not western I am from Eastern Europe @Dono also my father drinks beer, but he drinks vodka, whiskey and rakia too(one drink that it's mostly in Bulgaria but it's very strong) yesterday it was his birthday party because this week he got a birthday He drank a lot He also made another stupid mistake And that was one of the times i started disliking his actions Few years ago he bought audio system behind my mother's back with the family money 🤦 And if you know how much strong music he plays worse part is that he loves metal and hard rock 👂 :GWqlabsRIP: it's terrible and even after that my mother asked him for a prize and he gave a cheaper prize too seriously I just hate it when he lies and doesn't admit anything few days ago he bought a car radio for his birthday again behind my mother's back the car radio looks completely new and he says he got it from a site with used thing for 50% off 🤦 Also he promises to do a lot things and he "forgets" literally it's hard to give examples when he actually *remembered* he has and terrible habits like he doesn't uses tissues for his nose he uses fingers 🤢 I have been scolding him 21921029010921 times for this also he licks his fingers when we are eating 😷 @Dono do you know what's worse the "things" he gets out of his nose goes to the ground oh lol that's so fitting 😂 😂 At least my mother isn't like that @Dono i can kind of see it It's not @Dono Don't worry about it Because they are your family it doesn't mean you should like them @Dono same with my father At least my mother is normal, caring My father doesn't even care what grades I get about my accomplishments when he comes back home he goes straight to the fridge, gets something to drink (with alcohol ofc) lies to the couch and watches a serial or a movie Even if he has to discuss something with my mother ~~I wish my mother ditched him~~ My brother and grandma think the same about him @Dono no I mean like right now my grandma from my mother's side thinks the same tbh I am not sure if he has even romantical feelings for my mother my mother does but My father doesn't show any sings of love tbh He even forgot mine and mother's birthday once ok so anyways yeah i bet he is lying on the couch in the other room rn @Dono after I am over 18 Actually I don't know if I will be able to move out at 18 years I will might have to move out after I am done with university @Dono Yeah I get that You were 27 right? btw my grandpa and grandma from my father's side are arguing a lot not for big things if you get me like arguing for the little things my grandma is caring and thankful meanwhile grandpa uses me mostly for tasks and sometimes for useless ones but they live at a village that is 2 hours and half from here my grandpa? yes it's not good to depend on other people imo 🤔 i think my grandma is 73 years and grandpa honestly i am not sure No look It's okay but grandpa got over the line a bit because last time i was at village (this summer) on the day we arrived he needed me to go to the shop for not much on the next day on the morning again and then on the third day I had to again and the evening and that was going everyday until I refused at one point because that's normal he could just make one list and I will go it's useless to go everyday usually i am ok with helping like that but not and  when they are getting over the line @Dono exactly he needs one thing and uses me to go the shop then he finds out another thing is missing and asks me again 🙄 and my grandpa also isn't the thanking type bad trait for person who depends on other people anyways the sad news are that telltale is closed 😭 😭 😭 bankrupted they probably had dick managers because the walking dead was very popular ikr and episodes 3 and 4 of last season won't be released 😢 😢 I wanted to see how Clementine's story ends they probably didn't kill her off because it would be obvious That would be the dream @Dono Even if it was Microsoft I would be happy af now they are releasing episode 2 at Tuesday and it's over 😭 they will probably leave us on a cliffhanger @Dono well the day before telltale bankrupted they fired 225 employees maybe if the 25 remaining did something 🤔 with the help of the new company it's most likely because they didn't have a choice also I heard that they have been working on episode 3 which means that it didn't need much need' Yeah Sadly and Clementine's voice actor is gone also in episode 2 on the trailer it's revealed that a person from season 1 will appear we saw her for the last time in season 1 and I bet ep 2 would end with a big cliffhanger what the fuck did I just watch https://giphy.com/gifs/morning-good-reaction-ihWcaj6R061wc ... @Raven 3 aren't there are a lot dogs like that what the hell @Raven 3 you changed your status! @Raven 3 wtf do you get a sound when there is a new message @Raven 3 ?

There is a choice to disarm him I did 😭 He said I love you I hope we can hug him pls yay @Raven 3 remember the choice about give a toy back to Tenn or let aj keep it I gave it to Teen and now he gives it to AJ Calling him brave AJ refuses it tho 👍 ok so There was a funereal for Marlon Nobody besides Violet liked us Mitch suggested to make a vote people agreed because the arguing would stop and... 😢 ok so here might be the chance to find Lily! 100% @BigHutchHO please don't do this Jon and your dad loves you Yeah screw that job You can find a better one ^^ They just made a big mistake doing that @Raven 3 I am still at it and ahhh I just got into a very hard decision You see Luis felt sorry And he was very nice to AJ after he got shot Strange I should investigate this when I am home I have no idea last time I saw her she was bitting the hell out of abel's hand I didn't see him shooting though Ikr Feenie ships me with clementine :DD 😡 It is The person tried to make him white Yeah Just so Dallas isn't black I will take it when I am home 👍 ... 🤦 ...

Oh yeah ikr Few of them are racist too I am glad I got the chance to not sit near them They are very problematic in classes They got it coming getting kicked out because they talk in class 🙄 Also I am on the bus home It's very annoying that it's 3 hours for a chapter now The teacher let us go earlier Because she is going to a funeral I think 😢 It's her mother-in-law :GWinfxCry: @Raven 3 i will protest For the key stuff I am going to spam the shit out of their fb TSr and BSC coming out today I think the latest chapter of TSr ended poorly @Raven 3 😢 Nioo The ending The ending was stupid The ending Not the animals ....

We study British grammar :GWmythicalHyperREEEE: And by saying that English as subject is easy for me *in school* I didn't mean it was that easy in general And also auto correction needs to learn some grammar Yes ik I want to learn to speak it right Without my accent I don't even notice accent on you Besides American one @Raven 3 maybe The American person understands me overall So that's good I guess I just wish I had a normal accent It's kind of like Russian accent but not that strong The one I have rn Also English has a lot more words than Bulgarian Which is good Stuff can be described better ~~indescribable~~ There is just one thing I don't like in English If you say you have uncle/aunt it's not implied by the word if it's your biological or through marriage and if it's from your mother's or father's side 😱 @Raven 3 👋 Is it possible... Me being a match? They are making dog matches too? Fuck 🖕 Idc about captain America I am not American 😂 😂 But he wasn't the one who created the language. ☝ nice I never had to do that :GWqlabsKek: We did that only in class with the teacher watching ah ok 👍 Is this your first one my first one was in 7th grade Fuck my maths homework I am lazy trying to find 31!

I will give you a role where you die in the first 20 minutes :GWqlabsKek: 😂 😂 😂 Nah 2 like the game starts with him dying 😂 😂 And he has to say only 2 sentences It's perfect @Greenberry ❤ If you just know what are my humans... My arts teacher couldn't believe how much bad can one person draw 😂 @Dono Yes but antagonist I will be the villain 9k4 is the super villain No We are both killing 9k4 At the first two minutes of the game 9k4 kills Hilda and we will avenge him ~~he dies because he doesn't want to voice act much~~ Well then you have to voice act bitch No 😂 You either die in the first two minutes or you will actually voice act and remain for more time He will....*in time* 🤔 Actually... gta 3 protagonist was mute 🤔 But you aren't protagonist :GWqlabsKek: I made it one minute :GWqlabsKek: rip @Raven 3 :GWqlabsRIP: Cause of Death: 9k4 being his usual self 😂 😂 creepy af @Raven 3 abel fan art...

FINALLY SOMEBODY ELSE HERE KNOWS HOW I FEEL 🎉 Mate the bus once hit my bag because there was no place And people were egoists to move a bit the door of the bus I mean Rip my fucking bag Cause of death: Hit by a bus door 🤣 🤣 Also you have to get out of the bus sometimes in one stop so other people get out and then quickly get back in the bus that moment when I had to get out one old woman I knew I fucked up Jk I was able to get in there back **Just**-**in**-time :)) Did you ever had to do that @Tyr @Tyr No 😬 But there was that old man that ran like crazy to catch a bus Maybe he is from Olympic games 🤔 And he was running very well @Tyr Busses here always stop on every stop Busses here *are coming in "20 minutes"* "20" I hate it when they are early when I have to come back home sometimes and I am like fml and seriously one day I just wanted to get a cab but I didn't have money for it 😢 *insert sad ost here* Oh wait 9k4 is here *insert roe sexy ost* Hi @9k4 Wanna make out?

What Lindsay tells Heather in ep 19 they didn't censor two backstabbing traitor 🤔 when Chris reminds what happened in the previous episode 🤔 Yay maths teacher is absent and she will be replaced by somebody else She's very rude and trashy to everyone so nobody likes her Like how is piper being to Carson ... 😒 I was ~~three times~~ We have a sexist teacher 😡 She's always says how men shouldn't cry And the sun was literally on my eyes and it was very strong When I asked the teacher to close the window she didn't care saying that I should take it And my vision is a bit blurry now Thanks, teacher 😡 Isa isn't sexist from what I know though But the teacher isn't a Tyrant ... But you do know that we do as the teacher says right? Ikr I'm trying to be a good student No I won't I get good grades there now I don't want to mess it up plus she would call my parents SO??? YOU ARE JUST CASUALLY ASKING: "SO?" My parents wouldn't understand She isn't toxic in general but is sexist Nobody even cares if you want to call her out I don't want problems 🤷 Until I have another Bulgarian teacher I will have to @Dono nobody will back me up it would be dumb just to start calling out the teacher all alone The teacher would just make a fool out of me call my parents and probably even get something for my school notebook that I wasn't behaving @Dono 💯 sure Nobody cares when she praises women Nobody gave a fuck when she said that one guy crying in something we studied was childlish and not men-like 😡 Plus people in my class have a big courage to speak in classes and some of them don't have something inside there :GWpaboaWeSmart: like at all their dumbness is getting just more and more everyday Uhhh I don't think you understood me right they are not speaking on topic they just speak their own things and being problematic ... @CoolCCMystery how could you pull me down with you??

I could easily just give you some Bulgarian videos if you want to what topic? ^^^ especially when Bulgaria is small and almost nobody knows about it :GWskarzzLUL: Even Donald Trump didn't know about it until one reporter asked him about Bulgaria OMG YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? who's Paris Hilton What reality show? Enlighten me 😂 Wait on the video Greenberry found she even said six wrong smh it's not shess 🤦 It's shest I need to watch Vip Brother more lmao seems fun from what my parents have watched ~~btw heads up I love Total Drama and America's Most Eligible a lot~~ ~~I'm secretly watching Total Drama all seasons again and I'm at fourth season now for the 2181298th time~~ @Lexa 😱 wait let me listen to the video @Lexa quality of this video is shit lol 🤔 wait I found an old news video ... It doesn't even show the video with meeting her @Lexa good to know that there's another Bulgarian! *psst we can make a bomb of Bulgarian sentences* Do you know Bulgarian fluently? Nice 👍 No need What proof could you show for knowing a language fluently though Няма нужда ? What do you mean You didn't spam? I don't think so ... @Deleted User thank you I was about to throw my phone at the wall @Lexa so what is the time for you when I sent that message? 22:39 for me We said one hundred time that it isn't Russian Cyrillic alphabet originally comes from Bulgaria first Well it seems like you've been reading the chat above a bit :GWpaboaWeSmart: ... A "friend" from my past is trying to get in my life again Yaaaay 🙄 We have a complicated story but let's just say I hate her and leave it at this She's been my classmate for damn 7 years But hey I think I was able to tell her off She keeps thinking that we are friends after everything Nope I have no friends irl :GWqlabsKek: Mostly because I prefer it this way Well we haven't been exactly friends for long She was very annoying to me and had some arguments but in fifth grade we got along Then she betrayed me And we've been only arguing and arguing after Until everything ended after 7th grade Different high schools That's not an option I'm trying to brush her off before she tries to visit me Last time she did that it had bad consequences Came to school with low battery Perfect 16 but now it's 11 Rip I'm having  PE class Oh wait I might be able to not go :GWqlabsFeelsEvilMan: ... My Maths suck so much my average grade in Maths subjects. @Raven mostly in Maths and I have a test tomorrow :GWqlabsKek: Getting ready for my grandmother to be mad af for bad grade Damn 😗 I have problems with Maths since sixth grade :GWqlabsKek: Bill Gates ended school with an average D @Raven look at him now wow the horror Damn I think that in score my Maths would be 27.5/100 And we have different grading system Yes and I have 2.50 which is barely 3 for Maths I FUCKING HATE MATHS wait what I thought she was studying to get these grades it's not possible to know everything just like this ... Damn so I think that in PE I have two 2s Let's hate our lives together and complain about PE why do you have to be good at PE so you can graduate Like not everyone is sporty SAME I FUCKING HATE SPORTS AND MY TEACHER IS TERRIBLE for example today I had PE first class and I forgot to take my trainers with me big mistake my teacher FORCED me to play without boots I HAD TO FUCKING HAVE A CLASS ON SOCKS I can't run a lot too I get tired My heart starts beating like crazy @Lexa ehhh not every My arts teacher let me get away with a 6 for the end of middle school even though I didn't deserve it @Raven Being a fat boy that doesn't train and being on computer all day well not very fat But I guess me being on the computer all day gets me in that condition 🤷 idc though I wonder how to tell my Maths and PE teacher indirectly that I hate them :GWfroggyPepoThink: I'd prefer to not swear It will be held against me @Raven ... I meant with words not with actions 😂 geez .tell Pendejo in English @Lexa 96% of the Bulgarian teachers are female For some reason only my sports teacher and music teacher are men and what do they say I'd like to hear about their PE teacher because somehow I always have bad PE teachers that keep yelling at me and that I am pretending to not being able to run faster @Lexa wait whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat My sports teacher does swear sometimes :GWfroggyPepoThink: He insults me a lot sometimes that I run like i'm in the park and not like as if in the class Yes more like pronoun to female teachers I think? and for men teachers it's Господин that's singular same the first one is for men and the second one for women @Lexa ? :GWqlabsKek: @Lexa How could you you uncultured piece of shit 😡 jk btw :GWqlabsKek: i was kidding lol I wanted to swear at my PE teacher today But I knew that he would use it against me so I just told out quietly some swears in Bulgarian something like that ^ They don't have a good translation @Lexa @anh not every but my Maths and PE teachers are Yeah same The philosophy teacher I had yeah I have to change only two teachers and it would be fine for me what's the time in Turkey @Lexa you're one hour ahead we do change the hour but next year the whole EU will stop changing hours we don't know what timezone Bulgaria will remain  in not yet скучно ми е затова ще пиша на български сега знам че ще опитат да преведат това 👋 omg yes I knew that it would be on a sale but It is a new game these 5$ mean a lot to me 10lv rip I heard that the currency got even lower @BigHutchHO the perk in living in the UK you have stronger currency than the US too it's just that pounds is a very strong one 🤷 yup Pound is just very strong Rip Oh hi @Raven How did the meeting with your dad went He didn't hit you though right? ... I have maths test today For you Fuck maths Еми то аз врпр учих Ама аз съм си зле По математика It is! Isn't your nationality Bulgarian 😔 Also are they laughing at you because of history? Once in the internet a Turkish person laughed at me because of the history Gtf Gtg WAIT WHAT @Lexa "friend" I had a lot of "friends" I'm just done with having friends Idk why are people so petty for turkey yet @Lexa Yes sure they conquered us for 500 years but **in the past** That too The class after next class is maths ^^^ damn that's so accurate for Bulgarian meme @Lexa maybe if the beer was replaced with rakia LIS 2 is great! but the worker from the gas station and her husband are crazy 😡 I agree with only part of them maybe the mother is scared to get the kid born ok these conversations in the server are changing way too fast @Lexa ikr @Lexa talking about abortion I guess @9k4 he meant four things on the list 🤦 Who would agree with you @9k4 Condoms are invented so you don't have to have a kid @Raven ah ok why not the only say It should be legal @Greenberry ... well idk I think that the choice should be at least 95% mother's the mother is the one who decides at the end of the day the father can only affect the decision but not pick instead of the mother affect meaning discussing it with the mother idk how it is here no new topics please yes I do STOP CHANGING THE GODDAMN TOPIC that was it @Raven not every @BigHutchHO ... ... ... ... @Raven and how do I not have a say as a white person @Raven not here . that it would never end Rats are animals too @Greenberry you love Aleister? 😱 @9k4 I would take it if it's not me ofc 🤔 I mean humans are animals basically Classified as animals I would use 9k4 for tests if it means curing an illness ok guys I will prepare for sleeping "sleeping" i mean I'm 100% sure the topic would change while I'm gone oh Benji is just changing it ... Let's face it. Yes, Trump is a horrible person but America's economy is way better than it is in Egypt or most countries I agree with Hilda too @Raven it changed ok I will be brb in around 10 mins hoping the topic would remain the same ~~which won't happen~~ i'm back what's the topic @Raven wasn't your point before exactly that racism and oppersion are different to what? uhhhhhhhhh I'm confused ^ Smokers are literally everywhere it's so hard to avoid them i'm trying to because the smell of cigarettes makes me cough ... my father was a smoker too but he quit thank god @9k4 ? Hilda didn't you tell to me few days ago that. Racism and oppression is different Hilda didn't you tell to me few days ago that. Racism and oppression is different Yeah but he said that which makes him invalid Gay will be welcomed hard here I wish it was different though I'm Christian and would accept a lgbt person I wish I was asexual OK aromantic and asexual then ... **Demi**sexual? 😂 😂 Demi Lovato sexual exists 🤔 . ... .ud minor attracted person WHAT HOW CAN YOU NOT HATE PEDOPHILES Finally ... @Greenberry ... Girls are more privileged than boys in school imo don't @ me True true Also I've heard so. Many other things My arts teacher for example said that boys can't draw as good as girls but they should try 😡 Also she takes good drawings And once she took boy's ones She never said gender of the author before. But this time she specially mentioned that it was a boy Same My Bulgarian teacher is the one I told you about That she said that men shouldn't cry @Raven I. Mentioned her here Also My English teacher mentioned two girls twins and that one of them was doing karate and was having a short haircut and that it wasn't normal because that was masculine behavior 🙄 🙄 My sports teacher who and my music teacher are my only men teachers always assumes that men are better at sports than girls even though we have girls that are practicing sports And if a girl doesn't do as well as a boy she could get the same grade as him But if a boy doesn't do the same as girl Then he tells you to start playing better and stop acting like you are in the park Experienced it myself Because I did worse than most girls I do better than only 2 people In my class Told them basically the same They were boys If they were girls it would be nothing But like girls have the same abilities to be good in sports as boys We have girls that practice sports smh Meanwhile my sport is computer games Only hands I think Arms I meant But does that mean that girls should run 300 meters And men 600 meters? That rule is sexist af Oh and let's not mention the difference between woman punching a man and man punching a woman You can't deny the difference Anyway I think we kind of went deep enough on that topic @BigHutchHO next topic? So So i think that immigrants that are moving from warzones have every rights to do it And after the US are guilty for it They have to accept the people they are guilty for If they were guilty though But us launched these rockets on Syria when there are so many innocent people there Hello? Anyone? Rip chat ... I mean it's kind of good because he loses his arm and he didn't die I WILL FUCKING STUDY SECOND SHIFT AT SCHOOL TOMORROW @#@@#@@#@@# I FUCKING HATE SCHOOL @Lexa  sleeping isn't a thing that I care about much I'm OK with getting up early Fuck second shift At first shift I end school at lunch time so I get home and have a whole afternoon and evening free @Lexa we don't have two shifts it's just that 12th grades are having exams tomorrow Thank God we are always first shift.

I don't have any friends at school All I do in the breaks is play on my phone as I do exactly right now No Friends are bad I don't want irl friends I said I don't want irl friends We are friends People here are way better than irl people But anyway point is I prefer not to go to school Never missed it in my summer break And also first shift is better But hey actually there are some good news Classes will be 30 mins only @Lexa 😬 9k4 doesn't think so @Greenberry Feral overtook me 😡 well I handled not having friends without discord depends on the job janitor? :GWqlabsKek: plus i'm also shy irl which is one big negative on me school is definitely not the place for friends for me ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I can't be a public speaker I hestitate to talk to strangers and mostly don't even do it even if needed I wish but I know that it's not really possible tbh I talk fast when I'm shy around people like I say it fast to get out fast also when somebody doesn't answer me for 2 secs after I talk to them I leave I don't want friends but I at least don't want to be shy no :GWqlabsKek: :GWfroggyPepoThink: I can't really control it when I'm nervous around people I talk normally when I'm not nervous How did you know? I fucking hate busses Anyone having a vibration on their headphones? I agree with Taylor Is it good?

What is my brother drinking Bleach? @BigHutchHO Welcome? You were probably picking your nose @Raven That's one of the main causes of nose bleeding That too That's the reason You blew it way too hard And you broke a capillary is it because of the #the-elementalists thing? No... ^ Uhh @Weiss It's going to be official disease soon Yeah? That was confirmed in TF iirc Oh And 🤔 Technically ES is kinda not logical to be real Like the whole word can be in flames In another ending Rourke takes over @Raven Or probably just Grace Hall is written there In the comic Probably Grace Hall was just written in the comic Based on irl After all ES is cartoonish Sup I'm going to birthday party tomorrow My cousin's Nah these are boring And long Nothing to be sorry for lmao I'll take my pc, monitor, mouse, keyboard and headphones with me Along with the cables Good luck Hilda I don't have school in Monday too Also Tuesday too On Tuesday they will decide if schools will be closed for longer time If the flu is still spreading In some cities where school got closed from earlier point got extended break As long as my parents don't get infected I'll be safe from the flu Is pain in the forehead a symptom of the flu? @Raven there are even death cases of the flu now 😦 I saw at least 6 cases on the news... One including pregnant mother No, I meant deaths from the flu I'm gonna burn my school like how Hearst was burnt I'll be transferred to another school which I will burn too After all I will study something from school How to burn a building Nah I'll do it in the night And hide tracks Probably burn them No ^ I'll burn it when you are moving out and your dad is inside .ud Julie . No GTFO 😅 Hehe The mayor will probably keep the school closed till February 5th included The flu is still spreading Though it's not confirmed The mayor can do this stuff Get well soon, Hilda Are you feeling better from before?

Just because a lot of people like it doesn't mean that I am obligated to like it Well not for me ~~I have stronger words to describe fortnite but oh well~~ Also Overwatch is way way better imo I play it with pleasure @E-Smoke Don't call me out for playing games- Umm @E-Smoke Ty very much LA Noire is so good And considering we are having murder mystery rp It fits (No one likes Ninja tbh) Always am right 😎 Wait i'm a true virgin but don't like Ninja- Ninja is harassing people who did nothing wrong @E-Smoke My eyes have been red too @Purplesim Oh you are so innocent He literally harassed a kid in-game Also Ninja doesn't want to team up with women His reason: It may seem like cheating to his wife/gf Bs tbh He once made a mistake and suicided in-game and left the game, saying to his partner to not tell a word about it He will be famous but for being a bad person soon There are lots of videos in youtube which expose him There's a stream mode And he doesn't activate it It's his fault that he leaves himself so vulnerable 🤷 He does??? Nice that he's banned . Used quotes outside of the RP again But umm @E-Smoke Are you sure that he's banned permanently? The last two videos say 19 hours ago... the one before says 7 days Oh Tfue Don't know him I haven't played call of duty but I do plan to play it After I finish Battlefield 1 and 5 @E-Smoke Ever played Battlefield?

() Doubt
() Lie (X) Doubt Phantom forces 🤔 I have Battlefield 1 ~~But most of the games are free for me so can't relate to HP~~ What can I say It's glorified here Though I bought some games despite having the chance to pirate them Only the managers who do nothing about the game development Programmers always get paid The ones who actually WORK on the game And I'm definitely not going to pay 120 lv for a game As more and more games become that expensive No thanks Well, 60 dollars are not much for Americans as 120 lv here I mean by that logic, people from poorer countries shouldn't play games Yes and after buying important things There aren't that many money left @BigHutchHO Congrats! It's argument, not a fight Dw lmao Whatever Lmfao For bigger countries Nope, I don't do anything illegal for here, technically Pirating is okay here I don't know someone who doesn't pirate irl No But it's different It's different to break in someone's house and rob them Well idk I gtg I have been raised to pirate tbh While you've been raised somewhere where it's illegal It will take a lot of time Just to buy 2-3 games that you might not even like Oh wow damn @Greenberry You either not buy it or you play it for free Oof Is the lecture about piracy still going on I mean technically Modded apk is stealing Diamonds cost money Bish stop lecturing me then Developers always get the money It affects only the managers who don't develop it at all and get the most money and still get lots of money Plus I'm pretty sure you are trying to equal piracy with car theft which is way different Piracy =/= car theft HP is the one who keeps bringing it up It's not even drama It's an argument @literal legend.

What is there to like for him anyway Like I've watched before I knew this stuff and never really interested me much And? What would that *really* change ^ Exactly People will watch whatever they like T-series won't control youtube I'm just trying to understand how a company would harm youtube Well? Youtube are youtube T-series are T-series Well I've known PewDiePie for a while too But what if he says a homophobic comment Would you still like him Because you've known him for 5 years That's what you're kind of implying I mean you don't have to be team t-series I'm just trying to understand @ill miss you rae I wouldn't mind tbh This time he is He said the n word and promoted anti Semitic content Other stuff probably too that's what I can think of rn He apologized for each but these apologies keep coming The one that ends with er? Depends for me Oncr he said it just to insult another player On a live stream 😐 Exactly that He's the most subscribed youtuber... That's why t series should win imo Out of all words He had this word in his vocabulary for that situation 😐 I once saw comment section though I was disappointed From the apology video about the n word My classmates don't know it For the better Saying n word is serious Well pewdiepie promoted anti Semitic content once Wasn't holocaust anti Semitic HMMMM This world should be just completely removed imo I have no life Delete system 32 on windows xp My father has been selling a lot of stuff online He usually sends people to come home So the tech can be tested ^ *pays a diamond choice to find out what happened last night* I'm modded no problems And I have 270 diamonds anyway Connection optimal Clue none Stop No. No!

FBI OPEN UP ,im FBI OPEN UP Accurate for the moment lol Chapters has some decent books The fantasy ones But the amount of these decent books isn't big Just don't play romance in Chapters Don't... Romance is basically you're forced to be with one LI And you bang them everyday Every chapter Every goddamn chapter And their nude parts are covered with clouds The text is dirtier than choices You will lose your innocence Silver's idea sounds great Sex scenes are weird in Episode, from what @hanchoices has said to me I still don't know which sex scenes are a bigger nightmare Chapters or Episodes Bad boy book? You're saying they made a book with forced male MC?

Riiiight?? Good Ban Because it was beckett Well I'm telling you the reason Because it was Parker Exactly And yes Rip but not really Meh He shouldn't have runned away from the group Another person in SW? 🤔 Server war ... Feenie wants to join the valid side, namely me and hp *Nukes Sweden* Now you have to pick a side Rip HP and Doge VS Hilda VS Feenie VS some neutral peeps It's on The channel for server wars is #choices-chat ... Actually It was Hilda VS HP And I joined hp's side No shit Sure . I saw my message with "." too ^ It's spammy For this server . No point I don't mind responses But it's against the rules for that channel ~~I mean SWs are illegal too but shh~~ ... 😂 2 in a row in the respective book channel And no limits in screenshot channels :/ Yes it is It's spammy It doesn't have to be in a row Silver has said several times When we keep sending screens even if not in a row That it becomes spammy Just type the response lol And no more for a while ~~I'm just trying to pretend like I obey the rules so SWs seem less shady okay~~ h Make hfth You did everyone but my Danni well... I feel personal attack F Parker should look like a baby with makeup tbh Rip this server It's like it's made to be left for me HP and Hilda I finally had 3 dreams In one night One of them was about my Maths teacher checking my homework that I have for some reason So many siblings wow Oh With Jordan We Stan incest *cough* you're right actually ~~Shit~~ Congrats Benji I'm already married Whoa We just did it with witnesses No guests I've just found out sad news Rip EU internet... France and Germany came into agreement about Article 13 Spain is for I think And UK is dodging that I literally emailed Bulgarian members about this nonsense rfffrfrfr Welp... Isn't discord rip too though? If article 13 gets accepted @Tyr I mean You're not wrong We can see 4% of the youtube videos I think ...Who am I kidding? I meant 1% Okay, okay 0.01% You can't access anything that promotes something else For example One youtuber plays a game But they are not allowed to Because they are promoting a game Without any effort from the developer Don't say that One of the vloggers That I watch Who talks about conspiracy theories Gone Sing one word from a song? Ban Mentioning an artist BIG BAN So technically Your videos can be that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eoM26ZmHd0 No audio So you technically don't promote anything Oh wait Article 13: It promotes the color, BAN BAN BAN :GWovoYayy: Hopefully not Let's assassinate France EU politicians This whole shitty idea comes from France Fucking France And Germany was against But they made some agreement Which made Article 13 "better" But tell you what It's the same And now Germany is for too They were like: "This should totally happen let's just make a few minor changes... Aha... Okay, proceeding to ruin internet" One of the politicians actually Openly said that it's because he wants to destroy youtube :/ One person from UK human rights was totally against it He said that it's concerned So am I tbh That's against our rights of free speech ~~not like they exist in that server but~~ Welp I guess I'll have to get a premium one Free ones won't do a good work Also how am I supposed to find my games I usually search the internet for suggestions what to play 75% of my games I found out about from the internet At least It's everything Every goddamn thing that promotes something Even the mention of Netflix is a big no Mentioning a name of a movie, series How ill are politicians to support that Welp Furion It was nice meeting you 🤝 But That ends a week later This server itself is going to be illegal af How dare us promote a mobile app Who do we think we are Who do you think you are How can you make a server of a game for discussions That's against any logic You promote the game :GWmythiFeelsBannedMan: Well, rip EU But not every country from Europe is in the EU Turkey is safe So @Lexa is secure @Tyr Bulgaria is part of the EU as well Joined 2008 1st January Big mistake Well We'll have internet But It will be just useless to have it Dumb dumb The Western countries hate slav countries Now they pull that shit on us Well It will But VPN is made to be used you know For little purposes Not all the time Internet will be slower Not everyone will use VPN Yeah... And Australia @Tyr Don't you dare promote it @azula Well Final vote is on March 26 But the biggest countries seem convinced @Tyr Have you emailed your EU Slovakian politicians yet? One vlogger told us how to try to oppose Article 13 Gave us link to where we can email them and shit I singed as well I'm desperate If that was enforced before June I would've never known of that community Neither every other person from EU country It's like Net Neutrality I don't think Net Neutrality is as important, no offense Still was US users were fighting hard against it And it still died That's how I see Article 13 happening too :GWpingKanyeLUL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-0Eh6P4-UQ The guy is Bulgarian btw I've watched him before It's actually a video from a lot of people Natives That are saying it Link above Ironically there's French Hey Lexa We're dissing Article 13 From article 13 smh Oh OOF Internet is probably going to die for EU Moving to Antarctica :GWmythiFeelsBannedMan: @Lexa Well most likely if you don't use vpn Discord is a goner ... Wait Is wiki going to get banned Wikipedia technically promotes a lot of artists So probably BAN But I'm an artist The best one in the world I need wikipedia though Why do y'all complain over the ban so much anyway You're better off without porn @Tyr ...Maybe DUDE HOW AM I GOING TO PLAGIARISE FOR MY PROJECTS HOW CAN I DO PROJECTS WITHOUT WIKI I'm coming with you @Lexa Finally an intellectual @Julian Jello Yay Let's get the whole server I left just for 2 mins Wtf happened Why @Lexa Yay I mean Hilda is a dog Yeah @Raven The feeling is mutual LMAO Let's see who votes against There's clearly at least one politician that will vote against, right?

No... The majority has to be For If it had to be unanimous then there wouldn't be such worry Well you live in the UK Ofc you wouldn't care No Brexit @CoolCCMystery Expect us to come over @Julian Jello Tbh it's the Western countries Without Article 13 I'd say western european countries are most strict than the US Welp Article 13 affects us Those who are in the EU And that's about almost everyone But overall we aren't as strict as the UK @Julian Jello There isn't Well they matter to me now Politics can change a lot Article 13 proves it It can be used for good But no it has to be Article 13 President doesn't matter here Prime minister is the one who is in charge Welp Politics can help against discrimination Or just destroy us like that Laws can change I didn't care before But with Article 13 going on I'm not just going to be quiet If nobody opposes Article 13 it will happen easily We were able to delay it .

Somehow I doubt that It's a scam imo No president would just pay people like that *Everyone*? Noice Here you just pay taxes to be robbed And Andrew himself? Doubtable Andrew: You get money, you get money and you get money! Trees Well, that was Andrew covered There are other runners Elizabeth Warren Who is she? ``“If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to take care of yourself and the people you love,” Warren said in her video announcement.`` ``“We can make our democracy work for all of us,” she continued. “We can make our economy work for all of us.”`` ``Before joining the Senate she was an adviser to President Obama.`` Her age currently is 69 Automatically distrusting her There are 16 people running @Purplesim Who? C-note? She's revealed it before but I won't tell it instead of her I can DM you, tell me if I'm right? @C-Note One of the presidents Kirsten Gillibrand Runners, I mean ``The two-term senator has a reputation as a fierce dissenter of President Donald Trump, calling on him to resign over sexual assault allegations (which the president has denied).

Gillibrand has also been vocal about gun reform and advocates for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and people of color.`` She seems like a good person Yeah, actually Western countries eat so unhealthy stuff @hanchoices Well if they aren't salty what are they ...... r/PunPatrol It's legal to do long shifts There are so many cases of that It's concerning but nothing much done about it 6 hours is paradise indeed 30 pounds a day??

I get money in the UK and then transfer the currency to leva That's why my aunt went to Austria Holy shit So many Bulgarians leave for foreign countries @BigHutchHO What do you need for being a citizen in the UK @Lexa Yeah but Turkey currency is going only down Even leva is better than Turkish currency That's not what I meant I meant like being counted as citizen in the UK if you're immigrant Hi zee ... r/PunCourt It's obvious Benji You can see pfps Did I hear my name Wait Your nickname is zee Are you copying me? 😠 Lexa I see what you did with that hui You did!

Good luck I know you can survive I haven't done my Maths homework for today Let's hope teacher doesn't check me You can do it Go study now ~~Altair you know we're always up to SW~~ Server war Zee knows what I'm talking about lmao It technically doesn't break any rule Nah not really I have nothing else to do It's 0:18 I don't play anything now I'm supposed to be sleeping I got deeper into Vampyr . And I've heard something of brawhilla I always play overwatch Never get bored of it Don't get too confident These kind of teammates are the worst They also think they're better than anyone And call their teammates that are better than them noobs It's all about skill not confidence I play with mindset in the beginning knowing that I suck And later on I get better And then mindset changes Imo it's good to acknowledge that you suck in the game at the beginning Not tell yourself that you are the best I prefer to be honest with myself I suck no big deal I'll get better Welp I rarely chat in lobbies But solo ftw Sometimes I do well sometimes I don't I don't play as tanks much Welp I'm going to try to sleep And not think about March 26 much Love how you named it Sigh Not wrong I'll have to too Damn can't just that EU collapse Any copyrighted image for example Memes are full of copyrighted images Singing a song lyric In a video eg .ud ERP Most likely Good riddance to them But from now I'll have to draw my memes And I suck at drawing Wait.... WAIT NO RICKROLLS ARE GETTING BANNED ONLY THE ORIGINAL ONE CAN STAY No Ban You're promoting games with endgame button How dare you I'm a copyrighted pic You are promoting furries There are copyrighted pics of furries you know How- Article 13 memes ftw EU existence is a joke That was the whole point Memes are stealing the spotlight of a joke EU sucks EU is the worst Yep Actually If you pay money You get EA stuff But for EU that doesn't work ... Gn Hey My frequent emojis got reseted ... Yasss Maths teacher is late 20 mins now I can't leave We're supposed to be quiet and stay in the room If this was the last class though I would've I'd join the RPs but long liners are ruining it a bit Yes they are imo For example you're just saying that you're entering a room You can't always think of something And you have to read it long for something that if it was acted it would've happened for a sec . Yeah but idk I think that sometimes saying "Someone entered the room is enough" Depending on the action you can add more words "Rushed inside" Teacher comes 7 mins before end of class :mmYea: And agreed with Benji :mmNo: O She wasn't heading to the classroom :GWpaboaPepeStap: A day without Maths = A day in heaven As I said if there is something more to opening the door cool But if it's just casually entering a room why describe it so much if only 4 words of it would matter Why? I'm not saying that though furion That's not my point at all Ofc I'd chain them up But it's still short My point is if you're entering a room and expect someone else to do something Ye *joins the chat* ... Me trying to talk to a person I'm supposed to talk to F Yeah sometimes that's the case Try other headphones if you have ones as well Actually I had one similar problem My headphones wouldn't work on front jack ports But then I put them behind and worked Oh OOF F Nah Europe is better than US But US is better than EU if Article 13 passes Lmao you escaped EU But it seems like that costs you too much To UK I mean And brexit trolls some of my classmates I've never had plans to go to a trip but my classmates have decided to go to a trip to some of Western Europe, UK included And if Brexit happens before that They'll have to make a passport To that trip I'm not coming with them lol so I won't need one But yeah The only plus I see in EU and doesn't affect me Is the travelling without travel passport Money No Double no There's a possibility that it won't pass Very unlikely one But possible I didn't know that @Greenberry UK @Tyr Is assassinating politics included? @COREYB440 Welcome!

Decide to split and ruin whole industry and economy because of the dependence of Czech resources. Done by one man`` @Tyr You asked for it Bulgaria - Was one of the strongest countries in Europe but later enslaved  for 500 years after which it couldn't recover economically, the main reason why its economy sucks and later was under communism That's why our language has so many words from English It's just for proof Wrong Lexa We were so behind we accepted a lot of words from other languages Turkish, Russian, english Ofc we have original ones Then Russians Russians saved us so they apply their communism on us Were these the Russian lovers or haters Who loves Russians Lol I've met Russian people They were cool Doesn't mean every Russian is cool So do you surrender furion? Yep Worst world War WWW I declare Slovakia better than Bulgaria Wait which was the super well developed country With low population .tell Slovakia's population .tell Bulgaria's population @Tyr Once Bulgaria was drawn as Europe's toilet in a newspaper ajajajka Furion is hyped for article 13 vote For vpn Saying goodbye to memes, YouTube, Instagram and disc- ... Y'all are obsessed with your crushes 🤔 Let's rig the vote  @Tyr This may work It seems more possible than assassinating EU politicians We'll trick them into saying no We'll tell them that the vote is about article 13 not passing While it's actually for passing They'll say no this way And article 13 won't pass ~~I'm desparate okay~~ Tricking them will work ```Bulgaria has 9 for the article, 5 against,1 pledged to vote against`` There are 16 Bulgarian representatives Why I thought Bulgarian representatives are completely against article 13... Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, France ofc, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Wait How is France against the article This doesn't make any sense @Tyr Isn't Germany for it The whole article was changed because of Germany @Tyr Slovakia is against article 13, Bulgaria is for. More proof that Bulgaria is worse https://www.skidrowreloaded.com/the-walking-dead-the-final-season-episode-4-codex/ AAAAH IT'S OUT F https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18280726/europe-copyright-directive ... ....... @Tyr ... @EU... @World ... ``Members of parliament voted 348 in favor of the law and 274 against`` 274 sensible people @Raven Dude I was at school How would I play the ep ``Now it all depends
On how our countries put the law into national law`` @Tyr In the end it will be applied though, isn't it? Let's hope our countries delay this Maybe forever :GWqlabsKek: United States of Europe Idrk This is the first time I see law being enforced in action I didn't really care before But a rule that destroys my internet Big no This is not helping content creators All these promotions *helped* them @Tyr F So we won't get article 13 in the same time Most likely Our politicians are lazy and corrupted :GWqlabsKek: Ofc Same here I'll join you 👋 I'll get memes here illegally People get away with way worse Wait What is worse than smuggling memes Let's go spam #memes I'll go study ~~how to smuggle memes successfully~~ then probably spam the hell out of it And play twd ofc I'm downloading it rn @Tyr The term for enforcing the article is 2 years For Maths this is very good Complicated systems you've got there I prefer the simple ones here :GWragFeelsComfyMan: It's way different here Like If you get graded for answering questions But not on a test How do you get graded The specific number I mean 2 - F
3 - D
4 - C
5 - B
6 - A Literally that's it We use numbers No letters 2.50 is counted as 3 when there has to be a normal grade And everything above 2.49 is passable I really don't understand that percentage system 2 - 6 Well Impossible It's always made so the max grade is 6 If you get these points You get 6 If you get another points You get 3 @Water Puppies I can find a formula That our English teacher uses So I make it clearer Nah you don't need formulas Some teachers make it like that X points - Y points is 6 And etc Others use formula It's easy af It sounds way easier And that's how normal assingments can be graded Like how the fuck do you grade a normal one With percentages How does one for example get 98% Not test Okay so I have my last Maths test Is not based on formula You get a specific set points for a grade This test is 5 questions 16 points Some problems get more points than other for solving them Depending on level of difficulty So I've got 7 points 6-8 points is 4 Which is equal to your C That's stupid And complex I'm talking about POINTS not GRADES No look For normal assignments You don't get graded on percentage I'm not talking about essay at all.......... I'm talking for a normal questions Like the teacher asking questions verbally And people raise hands and answer And then Depending on how teacher likes it You get graded When you get grade It's always 6 (Excellent)
5 (Very good)
4 (Good)
3 (Average) ~~it really isn't average~~
2 (Bad) And if you were like really good With almost no mistakes You'd get 6 If you studied not enough to get the best grade You get 5 And just depends On how well you handle it Number grades but written like I said it Excellent 6 for example Wait what Nothing is graded out of letters Like at all HP Here Yeah That's how it is it seems And + ads 0.25 - decreases with 0.25 B+ is 5.25 But still accepted as B in markbooks Similar things can happen But they usually matter in Language subjects only In language subjects points can be taken off too For a grammatical mistake Even if the exercise isn't about the grammar But incorrect grammar in Science subjects for example Doesn't matter And it shouldn't If your grammar sucks its language subject will drag you down anyway It depends How many points is the question If there's a scale, not formula I can answer you in 2 secs If I had more context Not every test is like that Like some tests every question is equal to one point But not every For example Maths Difficulty of questions is different Some are easier than others And the harder questions have bigger score @Water Puppies I prefer it way much more than yours But in English tests for example One exercise can have 5 gaps right? And every gap is one point Don't tell me you don't have that Like if one exercise has 5 gaps And every gap is one point And we have like 5 gaps in 10 exercises 50 gaps = 50 points No? It's literally easier And are you telling me that if you have one exercise with 5 gaps And you get only one wrong You don't get any point on the exercise??? Like I'm literally trying to explain you for English exams Where exercises can have 5 gaps @Water Puppies Wtf? The grading system is the same for everything What are you talking about Are we talking about the same grading system @Water Puppies Dude I'm literally talking about exercises like Fill the gaps And there's a text And you have to fill them with the correct form of a verb For example @Water Puppies A text with gaps And you fill these gaps so the text makes sense I'm saying every gap is one point Which means one exercise can have more than one point And if it has 5 gaps it's 5 points And most exercises have gaps So in the tests where we have 60 points (English, and I'm in a school with harsh rating) 59 points is 5.90 I think h I was supposed to play TWD No. I'm not opening that shit OH THERE ARE NEW CHAPTERS UGH Oh yeah I forgot it's not Wednesday I mean I still haven't played everything from yesterday But that can wait Same I need to play TWD But I have to finish the war with HP Finish my English homework Shower Uh HP No DUDE WTF ARE YOU SERIOUS It's possible probably And no HP Sometimes it's just a scale Not any dividing Just... having X points to Y points can be a grade Then lower and etc Sometimes it's formula @Raven I don't like the sound of that 98 questions? Tf? Well, which subject Maths are hard so they are shorter But Bulgarian I had 5 questions on my Maths last exam One class is 45 minutes What's the difference Maths tests are just generally around that long The test is for the whole class Oh Not exam okay Just test One test and we have the whole class (45 mins) to do it ,im when you pretend that you aren't confused Dude The half of 98 is 49 You get F for almost reaching the half Nah I saw the grading system to 100 It seems harsh As everything that is 2.50 or higher passes here Scales are easy You don't even need calculator Well I'd have to make my own scale for a 44 questions test Sounds wrong though It's needed imo If a question has more points than other questions And you make a scale They do here For Maths questions have different points As just some are harder than others I'm looking at my Maths test I've got the first problem right 2 points I have the second problem right 3 points Third problem is 3 points but I fucked it up a bit So I have 2 points there The other two problems (exercises 4 and 5) are completely wrong No points there In total points are 16 The teacher has scale And in that scale I have C Which is my 4 6-8 points Is 4(C) Or 6-9 Not really confirmed but I have 7 points so didn't really care 4(C) is the Average Even if grading 3 you write 3(Average) In some places it probably is like that Rating system can be different but grading one is always the same My grandma said that it used to be 1-10 before ~~Which is closer to American grading system now so :GWqlabsFeelsKCHHH: ~~ @Tyr What's the grading system there I need more former-communist countries by my side There's nothing wrong with individual scales made by teachers Every teacher makes different tests And the questions' difficulty is usually not equal in tests So in order to get graded honestly Some questions have more points than others And a teacher makes scale Some scales are set by standards from the school So the teachers are limited after all Sketchy At least it's good to see that you don't give same points to every question You really got me concerned there for a second Ofc there are tests where every question gets the same points And look Both of us are biased because are born in different places ~~you're more biased but I have to end that~~ So I have homework to do, shower and play an important game So yeah I'll go now ~~Grading system here better~~ Finland ftw Their education system is way more simplier than any other And there is less stress Exams, homeworks aren't things that you do everyday Every education system should take notes from it Because they're the most successful one I have tests weekly too But doesn't mean it's successful Ew snow @literal legend. Wait are you saying Finland education system is bad Like It's literally one of the most successful education systems F Well I like History So can't really relate I can only say F Like how we used to? Um 👌 The dark side is united again No homo But true Everyone who isn't Parker has personality dw Nah Parker literally didn't have personality Hm? Debatable Like All characters have background But Parker just doesn't have a personality Okay I'm leaving before Hilda comes bye @Water Puppies I'd advise you to do the same If you have time I don't Ik I said two years Yep And every video that is of a game Promotes music in any way shows copyrighted pic Good luck with uploading it The last pic in #memes explains everything Exactly And they think that they're losing because of the state of yt rn Which is wrong af Rn they get more subscribers than they would ever get with Article 13 on Wait...

Moreover, it is Instagram that is liable for the user’s action of piracy`` Original content creators won't benefit much Night Like These promotions actually helped them get more followers Like if you post someone's work and you give credits They get more followers But now with Article 13 If that happens The social media will be blamed So they're forced to stop you, even with credits In any case, Article 13 is useless Anyway Google that 241543903 Mood I used to get sick every month of the winter but I'm better now Get well Finally Friday PTR cover isn't anything special YAS furion ~~put rcd 2!~~ Makes sense though Rcd 2 sucks more than hfth Hfth isn't that bad .

:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil: Classroom cleaning Me:
Hilda: 🙄 Damn my typo became more popular than expected Uh Why do I have permissions in #announcements :GWsetmyxPeepoEvil: ~~time to delete it so furion is forced to ping everyone again~~ @Tyr Just saying But I do I can delete a reaction Just look at them lol Let me see the ones Tay and I have mutual Though Maybe everyone can do that That's worrying Oh yeah Tay's alts don't have any roles Yup can confirm what Tay said What groups are there in PE We don't play dodgeball We played that like in elementary school only The best sport is not playing any sport It's already fixed It's 30 mins before new chapters Isn't sex biological for real though `` if you don't believe gender and sex are social constructs, then unfriend me now`` Skye mentioned that point Either definition of sex is biological Sex can be the intercourse or (the one that Kezz meant, I think) the one that you are aligned with your birth And gender is how you identify yourself I know only one person that Kezz may refer to I just say what I know on the topic 1% of the human population They are ginger people Ginger Literally ginger is for orange There is *actual* red hair Do you call them redheads too And I said that 1% on joke But it's actually only 2? Yeah wiki just confirmed that Intersex should be included as a sex everywhere The existence is obvious, scientifically confirmed @Raven Bitch Some people can be born with being neither male or female, from my knowledge, everyone is at first female and you either stay at female, or develop to male, but the process to developing to male can be interrupted, therefore being neither(or both idk for sure) But do correct me if I'm wrong That's right Being from a specific sex doesn't necessarily mean that you're strong/weak And what is sex exactly from your definition Our education system is sexist when it comes to PE because females have to do less than males to get good grades btw, which is wrong, because there are female sports players and males (like me) who stay on the PC all day because they suck at sports Well I rant too I don't think sex and gender are the same thing Sex is something you are said to be when you're born And gender what you identify But how would a person who doesn't fit in neither male and female category identified @Raven Btw I have just read an article And it's not ``Intersex people have anatomy or genes that don’t fit typical definitions of male and female. Most intersex people identify as either men or women. Non-binary people are usually not intersex: they’re usually born with bodies that may fit typical definitions of male and female, but their innate gender identity is something other than male or female.`` **straight** how dare jk @literal legend. No look More like The process from becoming a male from female interrupted And that means you can have male genitalia But different than a usual one I have that information from the internet mostly It's not educated in schools It's just that homophobic countries still exist And in my language, there is only one word for sex and gender US is very diverse But at least by law Everything is legal That's for here The same sex marriage is illegal Acts of homosexuality are allowed The thing is that more people should support same sex marriage It's the only way to be made legal No idea what's that Apparently it's banned regardless sexual orientation Whatever it is Oh It's banned regardless sexual orientation? I swear it was legal But maybe it got banned later Not every straight person can have kids hilda Some adopt, some try this Yes??? ^ In my family My grandmother's nephew and his wife can't have kids So they adopted 2 @Raven There are conditions which can allow to have at first but at one time, not able to later You've just found out about male and female infertility though Yeah male exists as well It's mostly useful for gays but it can be needed by a straight person too ~~Or just a straight person who can't find a partner but wants kids~~ Fuck kids No- Not actual fuck Smh We changed the topic and we're not arguing We're having a normal discussion Civil Which is rare And should be appreciated when it's civil Watch Hilda and I fight in 5 mins Surrogate surgeries Surrogate Let me see where they're legal actually @literal legend. Some males can have kids only at one point in life Not like Never able to Surrogacy is an arrangement, often supported by a legal agreement, whereby a woman (the surrogate mother) agrees to become pregnant and give birth to a child for another person(s) who is or will become the parent(s) of the child. Wait Why are there two different ones . Huh? Nobody is arguing We're having a civil discussion about it Plus, Hilda learnt something So did I The two types of surrogacy ``On the face of it, commercial surrogacy involves the payment of compensation to a surrogate mother; meaning that she profits from the arrangement. Altruistic surrogacy, on the other hand, involves either no payment or payment of only out-of-pocket expenses to a surrogate mother; meaning that her motivations are merely benevolent.`` I get it now I like  this one more :GWczeAngryCry: Agreed with Joelda It's just we changed the topic but it's obvious what we discuss It's fine no matter what That's no discussion The discussion is about the two types of it, why people are doing it Yeah That's how the discussion started Then we discussed the two types of it Yeah Hilda didn't know that males can have it but he does now That's why these conversations are important You can learn stuff from them I didn't know about infertility until I watched a tv show where it was represented There isn't Already told him 1992 times No need for repeat @ill miss you rae what are your pronouns I never really got to know them Nice Hmmm Okay bitch No? Why would it be Asking for pronouns is rather polite Well irl most likely it will be like skye said But for here @literal legend. nobody is like that But here it's online It's more appropriate to ask here Irl you just say something if you mess up you apologize and not repeat the mistake again ^ Irl it is awkward to ask It's as simple as skye said If you mess up and then apologize And not misgender Otherwise you have to ask awkwardly strangers what their pronouns are Which you yourself said Is uncomfortable @Raven it's their problem if the person apologized and never misgendered again It's hard to just know their pronouns Well if the person apologizes They are ignorant then And she has every right to be upset Wdym Feenie But we're all on the same boat for one thing: Asking person for their pronouns is awkward Talking to a stranger for example Referring to another stranger What do you propose then There is no better way I can think of Well exactly Feenie You have no solution but then you have no other choice That works depending on language though I doubt this will happen any time soon though Until it's corrected there is no other way It needs to That's agreeable @literal legend. Esperanto didn't work Who refers to gingers as gingers I'm pretty sure nobody with any hair color is refered to with their hair color. Sure it can be used to describe someone but refer? It's kinda insulting You mean referring to a person as they in a language that isn't corrected? Wait I agreed at first sentence But how where do you come from is related to pronouns Yeah but for example here there is no way to call someone with neutral gender form and I have to use either male or female Ofc in English I'm trying to use them more @Kezz You are calling yourself transphobic this way though What It's the way it sounds Wait are you just encouraging transphobia or do I read it the wrong way @literal legend. 9k4 has been typing for a while @9k4 they suck Hating on a whole sexuality never has a good reason Hate on the people who are prejudiced not the whole sexuality Heterophobia is not serious but still shitting on straights when not every straight is homophobic is bad Just as shitting on LGBT is wrong Saying just straights suggests every single of them And then saying "Straights are shit" when there are straight people who support LGBT and would help them is disrespectful .ud bigot @Greenberry 11 pm If it burns it will end eventually What Feenie said Some females have more abilities than some men It depends on a lot of factors .ud nihilist He's just trying to understand what happened He missed what happened here He's just trying to understand what thehaooened for this last hour He asked Feenie too And Feenie isn't NB Put pineapple in it as well JK JK *backs away* *and takes a shotgun* The norm for arguing is increasing What for Hi ``if youve just seen how many times ive fought with doge with that`` @Raven What for? :shifty: OOF @azula Get well soon @Purplesim Put a pillow in your ears or something so you can fall asleep, the thunderstorm won't be much of a problem if you are already asleep Said it just after ``if youve just seen how many times ive fought with doge with that`` Because you said it here?

To be identified as non binary I thought western Europe allowed it But as I was saying People get away with bad stuff And every politic is corrupted In fact some were involved in corruptee scheme One of them ran for president back in 2016 Thank God she didn't win Well not like presidents have power The prime Minister does ~~who's corrupted af~~ The prime Minister is right wing Originating from the communist party Somehow they won Tfw the communists forbade everything related to religion and belief but they were the first ones to step inside the church after communism ended :GWqlabsKek: Welp I'll stay up 🤷 Idk and idc who I am from that perspective We don't have SAT That's American thing Math path will never be easy for me My brother rn gets out of math path in university through bribery I probably will too Just gotta bribe the math teachers I suck at maths I've had problems with it since 6th grade Welp I'm way too behind on Maths Um Math level?

I just learn every word from it like it's a poem that I have to learn by heart And that's how I deal with it lol I wish I could drop subjects We can't drop subjects Everything is compulsory There are cooking subjects In the school for that PE is not what keeps me healthy I just eat healthy as much as possible Working out in most cases keeps your weight the same if you don't eat healthy So if you work out make sure you eat healthy and not a lot For the people who think that when they work out it doesn't matter what they eat - they will still lose weight are wrong Fast food is toxic Haven't eaten fast food for years ,im food cart Oh I don't think there are ones here Which is for the best Less temptations ...

(I've just noticed that this server is dominated by Americans too) I'm glad to be able to still connect  to discord though With article 13 I see how much I should appreciate that Not needed for now Also haven't encountered website that bans EU for a while Well there are many factors The main one is the vote on July 4 ~~The week after my summer break begins great~~ Also countries have two years to enforce it That mean they can keep delaying until then or time for sanctions I hate my country even more because MEPs were for So many times we've got opportunities to develop and our idiotic politics always refuse and even the media calls them out @Purplesim so yeah stuff isn't going to happen immediately Eastern week Or how is it called in English The week when eastern egg day occurs Oh still early Although Weather in the Philippines is great Appreciate it .define hypothermia @literal legend. every Filipino says that it's hot But for me it's heaven As an European Not UK though In the UK weather seems poor no offense Lots of rain I LOVE HOT WEATHER I LOVE IT WHEN IT'S 31C IN THE SUMMER I ENJOY IT A LOT AND IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THAT IN THE PHILIPPINES I abhor rain I can't stand it If I don't umbrella I'm fucked up I can always step in a puddle Uh No I always go out if I have school And that means going through twins Rains If I don't have umbrella I'm rip I stepped on a dirt without seeing it And I was watching in front of me I swear I was about to swear the shit out of this Because my jeans got dirty Sound distracts me from sleeping TF Like the sound on the glass The sound on the glass one the window from rain distracts me from sleeping I listen rain sounds on YouTube only Well when I'm asleep I don't get woken up easily But if it rains before I sleep Well I guess I'll be staying up Hugs :GWqlabsFeelsKCHHH: Oh and the thunder is even worse Not scary But annoying OOF I can imagine what happened But it's graphic @literal legend. you said you're hemophobic right? I have one question that will help because I'm trying to figure out if I'm hemophobic Do you get triggered by your own blood Me neither But once I thought about my veins And it made me pale The thought about it What about fictional  @literal legend. Well once ||I was in the bus... And I thought about the taste of the food in my throat you know what I'm talking a about and then it kinda resembled me blood and I started not feeling so well,my breathing was hard, I was barely conscious, I felt so hot and held onto the bus door to not pass out and eventually it was my stop I got out and the fresh air helped me feel better|| Even the thought about it isn't relaxing rn Also I can't look at people who have nosebleeds And girls actually do have nosebleeds now that I remember @MaxShadows I think it was you Said that they don't and that's probably the reason why Lexa never got one Well... At another point My own blood never triggered me except the thought about veins Oh I got that not once And it was temporary But I had the strong feeling I'd pass out ||In 6th grade I bled due to taking off acne on my nose yeah I'm trying to refrain from that, I took a napkin or something like that but for some reason the blood was a bit more than usual(not really that much to cause trouble) I was like eh it wasnt really that much but eventually the kids and the teacher asked if I was okay and just a little bit after I started feeling hot again, I felt weak and I kinda felt my blood I think, which resulted in me actually passing out in a class|| I still have bleedings from taking off acne Usually just for 2 secs So no problems and trying to stop that I do that mostly in school In class because I'm bored I have nothing else to do ||I've had too many close encounters with thinking seriously about blood. Another case was when my aunt had a surgery and uncle and mom talked about It but they reached details relating blood I really don't want to remember exact but I secretly went to the bathroom having the same symptoms without passing out|| And true but I really had nothing else to do Yeah I guess I am hemophobic thanks Anyway What is your fear Ah I see I kill spiders Some people say keeping them alive inside where you live gives luck but Meh still annoying I kill everything that gets inside It's okay I can kinda understand it even if I'm not afraid of them @ill miss you rae what's *your* fear Hmm fair Happy birthday! 🤔 Wait someone likes Americans? ~~I'm never going to change my pfp~~ Not at all Rcd 1 only It is Bucket of shit Hfth is good so I'd take it Rcd 2 💩 Nah hfth isn't boring It was never meant to be special Oh no you did not But okay as Hilda isn't here now That's beckett But rod looked like shit But people said What do you expect by the tittle Hfth was never meant to be something special but people complained that it isn't @Raven Not you only True I gtg though For a few mins Everyone hates America tbh Aren't you in the Philippines (asking because you said *here*) Lol Welp depends on intent Hiya OOF Marry me Bish I'm 112 years old in human years How are you older than that :GWragMonkaS: @Raven that's not my Mc tf The face yeah The hair is different No Maths in my Christian server 9C is okay I dislike it but at least you can be outside .w Varna """"Partly"""""" It's true I could use 19C F ... :GWvertiPeepoChrist: :hawyee: lmao :GWeulixWave: Next week, this sever will be Christian af Holy week Green witches Oh- That's not mine Wait You talked to Replika about Skye And it remembered?

I mean as long as you can find something that doesn't have a wiki ,im lucifer #nightbound True Eh And that's how pregnant teens appear Protection doesn't always work Plus, once doing sex, hormones might want it again I don't see sex as a bad thing It's normal It's different a developing kid to want more and more sex than an adult Plus a little bit harder depending on age What's the age of consent in your countries It's 14 here... It's 12-13 in other countries so I guess it isn't the worst here What is it in the Philippines? 😬 This legalizes partially pedophilia though I haven't used it in a while I think Same here Sexual content on TV doesn't allow underage so i thought age of consent is 18 too It's weird But in the end it's just a warning and unless your parents stop you, you can watch it I think that it should be 16+ If people want to make it under 18, 16 should be min imo I support abortion 100% *You called out some people here better run* Same for me but that's obvious I know a lot of pregnancies at 12 .ud Yankee Yeah I'm against teen pregnancies mostly because you develop when you're teen but now you have to take care about another life too Which interferes in your development Plus, you have to sleep more, limit food And as teen, it's advised to eat every kind of food, helps with development *Doesn't help for me* I don't have allergies @miruna I agree Women who are anti abortion are against their own rights I know women who don't care about sexism but still Then you support abortion laws Right? yeah I think that it's important to have the choice Plus if you start abortion at the beginning You might not know if the baby would live anyway You can't be sure if the baby will have a disease or something if you start at early stages Yeah but not every life Some babies at the beginning have problems And they might die even before pregnancy And what do pro-lifers say here? Put them in for abortion? Plus it can be the mother's life that is in danger Yeah *Looks at Alabama* Mentally and physically @Julian Jello For the carriage thing Plus the birth process isn't that easy Some might just not want to go through it And yeah putting your baby in for adoption isn't always great I saw a story where a girl gives birth, at 18-20 And then she puts him in for adoption And eventually she feels sad about that Not being able to take care of her own son and never see him Yes ... I typed abortion on mistake :LMFAOdead: Yeah In my family, a cousin of my mother and his wife adopted two kids because they can't have a baby I just wonder if their parents eventually come back They are from two different parents The son is almost 2 years old now and the daughter is somewhere around 1 year They are planning to tell them the truth I think so, yes Btw the boy will have birthday next week To turn 2 years old But their biological parents can probably just be too young now To take care of a kid Men almost never get to adopt here if single @Raven Have you thought of surrogacy Just asking Same back Russian orphanages? How's the situation there Eek There used to be abusing in orphanages here Like a lot of cases They fired a lot of staff Ew It's better than third world countries at least Because homosexuality in Russia is technically legal But Putin allows purges In third world countries it's banned Since today, In Taiwan same sex marriages are legal The first Asian country to legalize them . We said it at the same time There is still no country in Africa to legalize same sex marriages Except for the colonies Because same sex marriages in France and the UK are legal I intervened in the online poll I voted for Same sex marriage isn't legal here as well @miruna Even Turkey seem to be handling human rights better than us The Instanbul convention, the National plan about kids I'm straight but I still think that gays and straight people should have equal rights Sadly that's an unpopular opinion around here I hate how Bulgaria dodged the Instanbul convention and the National plan about kids It's been proven not to It used to be treated but scientists proved that homosexuality is normal and can't be changed People here aren't familiar with most of the LGBT terms Like people here only know what gay, lesbian and trans is bruh ^ Wdym other genders Both male and female, neither etc It has a lot of different meanings demiguy? #choices-chat I'm saving you before a mod comes Np I have a lot Modded apk ftw Yup android is bae @miruna You have huawei?

VOS really good My spot never changed ever since ES With #thirst-channel existing I doubt you'll leave voluntarily hilda We need to bring the force 🔨 Recent post? Oh Quinn >>>> Michael However Estela >>> Every character in choices combined :GWcorbinTopKek: :GWcorbinTopKek: :GWcorbinTopKek: :GWcorbinTopKek: :GWcorbinTopKek: Okay I'll stop You got the message -Not King One person, very stupid I'd say said: "I'm not gay, but I'm bi" Hilda knows who Hilda x King @Raven Remember when you flirted with him? xd Dw I was in the same situation just... not entirely me Cort did * It was cort It was cort . Tbh I think we have some :GWcorbinTopKek: Or I could just make a random acc And get in the server xd I wonder what king said after he banned us Nah Uhhh The summary might become long . Let me Get something in my defense It's more complicated than that but eh Why the f can I not search for your messages in the group chat :GWchadMEGATHINK: It was See? Even dewqs is confused We gotta start from the start LET ME CHECK OMG But let's start with the beginning @Raven yes So there was this guy who came in advertising, we had some drama with him as he kept having alts but he eventually got banned That was Johnnie King may or may not be his alt but he claimed to be a hacker who knew that this guy Johnie had 5 alts but from what I know he never even said which @Raven I think? He started acting weird tho He was obsessed with knowing everyone's gender and was especially "excited" if I can put it this way if they were a girl Definitely Feenie made a group chat dm with some of his most trusted people including @Raven (don't leave me here explaining alone bish) But I am too Nah It had alts and fun story Yukki, one of the members made an alt She there claimed to be a 13 year old weeb Nah Yeah we weren't sure if he was that horny yet Until that alt He's 16-17 He shared a pic for the 13 year old girl Two of himself Oh yeah No He didn't say he was 18 He said he was 15 to yukki and 16 to you And that's creepy because yukki had the 13 year old weeb acc And Hilda claimed 17? In his alt And Hilda started flirting with him(oh yeah he did 😉 They shouldn't King was inisting on yukki's pic a lot Wait hilda You're rushing it I renamed my alt to cort And joined the server Claiming to like naruto Because he likes naruto With sasuke pfp And cort's age was 15(almost 16) so it's just closer to his age And I started flirting with him through cort right at the beginning Since he clear would flirt with any girl it actually worked I still have the dms I can screen some stuff xd That's like literally the very first message :GWcorbinTopKek: Well It's a new thing for me so shush It worked I used punctuation so it doesn't sound like me LITERALLY A FEW MINUTES LATER Max and Chloe otp But anyway that's just the first day . Very few secs later Big cringe :kchh: cringe aw I miss kchh You know what the biggest cringe was He used "bestest" Ure the bestest That's his mentality He often acts similarly Me justifying I can't give a pic After he sent ones in the server Just said my phone was broken lol 👌 Oh yeah he did with me too In fact rp too But We decided to spice things up @Raven Dw Let me get to the spicier part So there is obviously a spark between king and cort at this point @DaHomieDrew Nah that's a few days later @Raven Stop rushing And king said this In his own server But the previous day We decided to start a drama Because look at this shit Why would someone date someone like that Yes LOL So yeah let me get to the argument hilda It's a really fun part Where cort goes after king for that screen We have it all screenshotted He even tried to DELETE the conversation But thankfully another person in the group Had betterdiscord And could see deleted messages So this is how most of it went: brb Nah His own KINGdom So king fiercely denied that That he beat the kid He claims that he was the one beaten up and he was lying in front of his friends so he doesn't seem like a weeb ~~ignoring his weeb pfp tbh~~ Here's when he tried to delete everything However Wanna hear his explanation? What happened Because everything he says is the way it happened (SIKE) First he says it's dare but then, for his precious cort, he started explaining And he says that his parents didn't like him So at the AGE OF 6 his friend took him under his wing, supported him And king was slowly starting to realize that his friend was actually betraying him later(what) So once they got in an argument and he hits the kid, and the kid retaliates by hitting him with the pole And then he falls in coma for one month with no health consequences for him He says "Miracles happen, right?" No not adopted Just he took care of him Yeah as if a 6 year old is such a schemer He miraciously woke up from coma and continued living However for the spice of this drama We let it pass Cort said she needed time ~~He banned me for opposing him but not cort hehe~~ Another mod got my main back in the server but anyway a few hours later I just said I forgive him Cringe bestest* You gotta admit I had to Even if cringe And here's the next step :GWcorbinTopKek: 🤡 🎪 Notice how it was just one-two days @DaHomieDrew Oh believe me I wanted to expose myself the first day Feenie kept me in check Another guy, who's also the owner of the other server ilu And then of course, Hilda's screenshot Oh wait now I remember I wasn't bad because of the drama I was banned because feenie was joking about having seen cort's feet And king said no jokes about cort However I made another edgy joke and got banned xd I did get unbanned later So technically he bought the engagement ring but I did too and proposed and he accepted Marrying someone who you barely know But That's not everything @Raven I'm praying upon every God possible That the song is still there I WILL He made a song about cort(although did he really, not sure) Nah not PT But I'm trying to find it I'm sorry I couldn't save more Because this stuff is next level comedic I FOUND HIS CHANNEL MOMENT OF TRUTH AAA THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT HAD A RESTRICTED STATUS WE NEED THE LINK Okay.. I'm getting in king's server With an alt No Oh yeah Nah I haven't deleted it No It's just You have to click the link To see it That kind of status Okay I think I'm getting there guys I have sad news... My history only led to his channel BUT HE HAS A PART OF IT PUBLISHED IT'S LIKE AN INSTRUMENTAL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-y8gkajvDw Also look at his other video :GWcorbinTopKek: I don't have the link with the singing part tho : ( Inb4 cort most likely King style dance omg i'md ying @CoolCCMystery ? I think I remember that btw... I just noticed something This published video is made in May But the instrumental Sounds like in the song wrote a song for cort hmmm @Raven Oh btw remember our last minutes in the server? Since we found out king's been flirting with Hilda too And in the same morning when cort and king were getting married So basically that's when we threw the tantrum And that's when I finally exposed cort xddd Also weirdly he knew about yukki's alt by the time And didn't take much notice Didn't question another weeb dming him the next day So yeah, wild story First person crushing on me(most likely) xd We joked that the cort/king dms were like a cheesy romance movie Funniest part is that after ban we got him in the group Nah he knows it Some stupid people They would do something like king Never listen Have a nice lunch Imagine waking up in the afternoon I'll be brb What the fuck do I come back on Yeah a psychologist has to prescribe them For the right amount That would be a pill for getting anxiety back Visual one maybe Why don't we test that? To kyo I mean tbh do horror movies ever make you anxious without the pill? Lmao Tbh my father downloaded lots of horror movies recently They're all boring Most of them some family turning into a monster And starts chasing the other members of it I watched Halloween It was okay But tbh action movies draw me more Ure hoestest @Jinii Minii Good joke ^ Oh ^ hehe ure the bestestestestest I'm here OH HOW DID YOU GET ACCESS TO IT? DAMN @Jinii Minii @DaHomieDrew Remember when we were talking about that song? :GWcorbinTopKek: @Raven Pls send link Thanks This record is from June 17 lol That's the case He said it was made for cort but June 17 :GWcorbinTopKek: Unless he's a time traveler :GWaobloChildPepeSweat: I'll have my first flight in December @Purplesim Austria nice ^ No way we do Didn't king talk about some unofficial server? Not much sure but we can check somewhere By Johnie's claim the app's(secrets) news feed say that they made an official secrets server but didn't put the link Sounds like BS tbh Why would they promote a server and not put a link You know what At this point Secrets might be better than choices I'll get it Diana . I see what you did there I'm the only person who voted Diana lmfao Aw Courtney won Arguably Yes Yes it is Sure Yall take it too seriously Tumblr is the real toxic place not here I was hoping it wasn't the smiling face but oh well Drew's :Pirate: Diana gang I believe Im the only Diana voter When I voted i was Nice For being the first voter I lowkey thought the stripper will win :WTFthonk: Yes sarcasm From what I've played of BP: Diana > Aisha > Ash > Frank Between Courtney and Reed idk I like how you changed your name to Drew's Dewqs and Drew's get pronounced almost the same way now that I think of it Dw I had my name autocorrected too Twice Soge Yes Hilda has it right I'm a dog Wut @Tyr Lexa is a slav But nah Don't want to mail myself We can do it furi There are so many slavs in the west We're going to overtake them @Water Puppies you own the name ig You created it I claim Drew's then Felony Martinez? Did she commit a crime Oof Always drama around celebrities Some people believe celebrities are flawless They all did something bad but idc art more important I don't ^ Being famous is depressing It's stressing to be famous hence why so many celebrities took drugs Also paparazzi going after my family And my personal life New pfp Cuz he can My nickname is justified Hoenie @DaHomieDrew IKR Very . That makes things even MORE disturbing Well you're dissing Melanie Martinez and Hilda almost killed you for it I diss Courtney and you almost killed me for it So my nickname is justified Nor did Hilda No he didn't He's alive for now But if he keeps pinging me in #robo-lab-bots I'm going to change his status of being alive Why you gotta be so rude 🎵 It's a good song Me after I kill dewqs for pinging me again - look what you made me do 🎵 Yes Sigh You ruined it Get out before I bring the weapon again 🔫 H ES 99% sure Oh I didn't notice we were in general That's a hoerrendorous thing to do tay Hoe I thought you didn't care about the word hoe before I'm not But you used the word hoe before for describing others Stfu hoelda Hoerion Hoelian Hoeiv Hoenji Hoenie ... Yeah i've had that problem viv gosh ... 2 weeks to school It's today? The European Labor Day is on May 1 There is a national holiday on September 22 so one fine day without school in the Monday following lol I just listened to drama club didn't like it Her really good one is dollhouse :ally: @Raven wat uh @Jinii Minii Ikr It's been a while Oh I haven't listened to that I could barely hear the lyrics in drama club From all that fake singing ~~You assume I like charli~~ sometimes it helps In this case it ruined the song completely the autotune it's literally autotune The full leaked song 3:43 It's the only thing that popped up when I looked for the leaked version And people in the comments were like pretend it didn't happen It's on YouTube The first and only thing that pops up When you search Melanie Martinez drama club Others is some short versions probably the snippets Ye It's super bad  and can't believe the same singer sang dollhouse Oh Well good it isn't real Okay this sounds good I've heard a fake And auto tuned af And then you mentioned there's nothing wrong with some autotune and I was like wtf Yea exactly Link above Or yeah just this :LMFAOdead: Jeez Might hear the rest of the new album if I can find it see if it's good Nah snippets are nothing Don't want to hear mid song smth better just the whole song Or what is leaked Rip Why does it matter so much It's just online leak She is posting them soon anyway It would be posted either way She might get only more popularity Well there is a rule about that in our school We don't have cheerleaders Mine is yes Feenie It's very popular in the US Plus short skirts aren't allowed here Haha lol Funny joke Yup same here And as for superiority Vatican city is the most superior state Holly see has the longest standing army @Jinii Minii what I hate jeans with holes Boys can't wear anything different from jeans so In my school I mean My previous school didn't have that dress code Jeans are tight But I have no other option either way I don't mind them And I wouldn't go out with tracksuit outside Many people believe it's massive in Eastern Europe but it isn't really They are disgusting Nah I don't mind the jeans I have Just saying why people would hate them Also when I buy jeans that are too long I can just go to center and find a place to cut them with keeping the design Doesn't cost much Did this before and jeans didn't look cut at all The way how the song sounds is the most important Bruh when school begins it will probably be 30C and I'll have to wear long jeans @literal legend. step one make a good game called choices Step 2 profit Step 3 ruin it Yeah wonder if they have a 4th step Why :GWinfxThink: Maybe ruin it isn't the last step Maybe they can revive it True although it's a part of ruin it no I believe that's everything Even if you didn't put SK you wouldn't have to apologize sigh The leak sounds horrible It's literally the song speeded up @literal legend. Remember when you sent me the leaked drama club on instagram Apparently it isn't available in every country I tried with different vpns Seems like it's limited to eu excluding uk I mean the ban It never did and even if it did it doesn't matter because it didn't last month Before bp it was bb BB was actually eligible to partake in the vote this time too but it ended so rip @literal legend. Unhappy meal is part of the new album right? So it's not officially out but leaked And the others but listening to the leaked version is a torture and can't understand anything i know But it's just stupid to leak them that way There are better ways nah I prefer to listen to the full song @Jinii Minii more like I'm the creepy guy amirite More like You're the straight guy RCD 3 You're kidding SK has no votes RCD 3 has 9 r/woosh Yeah I always am Def Nate isn't forced at all idk why people are complaining They're just whinning Well let's transfer the rcd 3 votes to SK I forgot about peanut butter The art matters more than the artist What's the weather there?  @DaHomieDrew .tell 106 farenheit in Celsius Jesus christ You will almost reach France and Germany They had .tell 45C in farenheit They had 113F this summer And made records Global warming at its peak I prefer too hot over freezing tbh I really can't stand anything under .tell 0c in farenheit Hot >> cold Under 32F or 0C I just wish we close the school If you put on jacket it's still freezing It literallt doesn't help And still gets me ill I prefer to eat ice cream over laying on a bed with high temperature Well my t-shirt for school has short sleeves Like it's just some sleeves lol Laying up doesn't help Especially if it winds like hell I have school at winter you know When it's hot i don't need to put one hundred layers of clothes And am sure I won't get sick because of it I usually get sick in cold weather so 🤷 And cold gives them conditions to spread While in summer they just can't I don't have allergies Not so far at least And I haven't got sick in the summer And what was the allergy I don't know if my parents are allergic Plus hot time means time for beach when possible Cold means to almost never open your window I have a net tho On my window Window screen okay Point remains I wouldn't never open my window if it didn't have it And I don't need excuse to stay indoors Sure my mother makes problems of it but it's always like that so I haven't left my apartment for other stuff than beach So 95% of the time I was home And eating ice cream That's the good times I know raeght Rain Kyould've just waited a bit for you @kyo DaHuqDrew? Did you really think Dat Probs if you change time it'll be there But not sure of that That's the thing I don't really like retro graphics So this game has to do something with the cold war? I'll download it Just installed the game Story time what is East Grestin Is it real or fictional . Oh lmao But they robbed everyone there That's what EA does It's not like you were able to express disagreement with it tho EA has the most downvoted  comment in reddit 33k downvotes dude Yup lmao Year in the game is 1982 City names? Bruh Wrong screen alright bruh.mp3.mp3 what about rent It's automatic? SKSKSKSKS He gave that Oh yeah she But damn someone just tried to escape And threw a grenade at the check guard And everyone else just ran away I did Good day: Cut shortly by a terrorist and my son is sick And everyone in my family being cold because I forgot to pay the heat Btw just a question Does the story ever end? Damn, there is a possibility of a wrong photo I'm on -40$, everyone is cold and my son is sick And rent has gone up and also hungry . Penalties So the game has 20 endings? Nice That's why we have youtube Yeah gotta play better next time This time I know how it's done and all yes This game is very good Fuck kolechians Do you know who really suck? Impors They changed their name from empire They want to take over glorious arstotzka @MaxShadows Pretty much I got arrested *I was just really bad at my job I didn't mean to be a part of the resistance* *Tbh these discussions should've been in #music cough* Ig idk Furi... I have to tell you something I was kolechian all along And I avoided the checkpoint Smh You blocked my permission to type We kolechians will revolt Down with Arstotzka tyranny! Not again Allow freedom of speech You forgot creeper So we back in the mine And protest against Arstotzka's government No . You're going to end up in your own gulag furi Commie Then stop sending me to the gulag Give us kolechians more autonomy in your country Kulak Totally I'd like to see what happens when you get sick and all your doctors are gulaged But they're all kolechians Because we kolechians are good people No Stop Kulaking What did we do to you :( The only bad kolechian is the one who first tried to get in Arstotzka without a passport and then made a fake one You can Kulak him No that's the only bad one Remember the terrorist attack in the checkpoint? We'll do more if you don't give us more autonomy Bruh we have nukes No we're going to destroy only your pathetic Arstotzka A better world We don't use the biggest ones to destroy the whole world Tbh we don't need to nuke you We'll invade you We have you surrounded Arstotzka will be wiped out from the map We'll have hell from Republia They are a democracy that want to end your authoritianism Sleep, have good dreams and wake up to our flag in the morning Nice citation Yasss another Kolechian attack !! What is 13 reasons why for originally? That seems like a heavy plot Not my type Seems wild Reading the spoilers above @Tomas same lol Winston the monkey from overwatch No u :WTFthonk: Welcome  @Destructo Well yeah Having appointment in hospitals should be illegal There is emergency room for that Im talking about doctors not emergency rooms It's stupid to wait in the hospital and someone just says they made an appointment and you have to wait them too I'm talking about doctors that don't give immediate help tho Most people here are just for checkups What no It's not organized unless you made an appointment About a specific hour Emergency rooms are usually not made by an appointment that's what makes them emergency People come for checkups here Not life threatening situations Because I came before them they just come have an appointment and get there first Arranging takes too much time and I don't want to frustrate people I'm talking about arranging appointment I can arrange by I don't want to frustrate the people who came before me and take their place They came before me and rightfully can see the doctor before me I don't think they do How can they avoid waiting in hospitals? Exactly Oof my turn brb ... Somebody just took another appointment And got before me Nothing changed for me and I updated yesterday Went to trouble Wat They just have to call there and make sure they get a response Yeah we don't need to busy them more with these unnecessary appointments Yeah so? Well that's fair  @Raven If it's mandatory Then it's okay @Destructo that's a weird concept @Raven then everyone makes arrangements so it's fair but here it's not mandatory and a lucky person can get appointment Because it's not fair And not that easy It is not And in that big country?  @Raven @Destructo it's not that easy to make an arrangement and it takes other people's turn in the queue @Raven well just the city you're living in is huge Isn't making arrangements hard there? I was just saying something that would be good if it happens but won't happen That's true but in this case it's not really necessary I know I'm not saying it will happen It's more likely to make arrangements mandatory than ban them That's not our biggest Healthcare problem anyway Free healthcare is my wet dream One of who Well good night Gn Because it's not It just ended And not really we weren't arguing Debate =/= arguing tho Plus just needed to do something while I was waiting Yearly mandatory checkup for school I use YouTube for music Although I have Spotify Oh I can see what kyo meant by different font It's completely different on pc rn I like it 🤔 Hmm light theme is actually improved We aren't working with them Btw which country do your parents come from? Well if a kid of mine ended up smoking and drinking I'd become more serious too Underage that is Same So do mine Parents aren't perfect Same thing although they aren't supportive of everything for me We were talking about parents What Oh the nationality? I was asking Drew as we moved the conversation from choices chat Why would it matter either way this question got buried among the conversation But yeah I know yours ~~I know where you live, look behind you~~ This is why I dislike anime The characters literally look like out of an anime As if it's the only game of the kind what The debate *is* pointless and no I didn't understand your point School in 5 days Ik I wasn't talking about there twelve hours? damn I'll study in Vatican Maybe become a Swiss guard jk but who knows what they're doing there Swiss guards are the ones who defend the vatican Seriously tho idk where I'll really study but *probably* not here No social interaction in college much so that's a plus for me @Lexa How are the Netherlands? Kinda expected with lots of rain @Raven That's not how it works around So the stereotype about weed is true Seasonal depression is understanding The mood overall seems depressing everywhere when it starts raining compared to when its sunny It seems common among people How are the people? Yes Their language is too Too many bikes in Asterdam lol Why steal when there are bikes everywhere Is it really that much for them The things I can do with 30 euros here... Yeah They have good salaries Well, more salaries, more expensive stuff I'm more leaning on Austria/Germany wtf I'm calling my friends in the FBI to close your school hilda And good luck lexa @Tyr Bruh I still have connections The revolution will succeed Kolechia good What Essay in math But like What do you have to type there What do you have to explain in an essay for math oh I thought it was related to the material Why tf are they asking you to write that anyway I bet if you say a shithole You'll get low grade In Kolechia we will ban that You can't find me 🔫 Stop your oppressive communist regime 🔫 Well why wouldn't they read an essay? My essays are always written in class and then handed over to the teachers given back with a grade I don't have essay as homework although rarely they give us the theme To get ready for class Rarely jesus At least it wasn't geography I hate geography How specific the stuff we study is From the smallest lake in the smallest country I don't mind learning the basics But we just get too much I just learn it all by heart for the test or whatever we have and then forget a lot of it @literal legend. Geography, history, biology Which one do you prefer the most out of these three ASSOCIATION FOR SPECIALIST FIRE PROTECTION? sorry for caps I copied it American Foundation for Suicide Prevention? Wtf I thought you were talking about your teacher and the classmates Well the way I see a lot of Americans talking about history it does seem like they're doing something wrong there Ig the consolidation is that it's probably worse in Russia Well Russia's studying of history is certainly better now Than before the 90s While we were under communism in schools people were taught world war II was only between Germany and Russia sigh Get a room you two LOL @DaHomieDrew Great minds think alike So get a room you two . This escalated really quickly @DaHomieDrew ^^^^ You still thirst . #robo-lab-bots IDC #robo-lab-bots :eyez: Different language but you get it Yes I'll return the favor :eyez: bye bitch Like me I know I am feenie <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ> best song no lol wot Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa You know you love me, I know you care Just shout whenever and I'll be there You are my love, you are my heart And we will never, ever, ever be apart yes @BigHutchHO oh god This song is spreading like the flu no me I listen to almost everything tbh I hate rock(mostly) and metal Depends on the song tbh Is it tasteless to ask a homeless guy if he likes house music?

My father told me he was into k-pop and I told him "k, pop..." bts kids toys lol @BigHutchHO #memes Kinda weird their merch is kid toys They probably do have shirts and stuff tho who is buying albums nowadays isn't it? I know it's genuine I'm just saying that it's like a meme Oh and that too Yeah what are you doing *in* the toy store benji mistook the kind of toy shop he was going in inb4 They had a better role in the past lmfao "this meme is so old but the people who are deciding the future of the internet are even older" so accurate Still feel betrayed from my country for supporting it(as always) My biggest problem is bots deciding what I should be doing While watching everything on the internet ofc and invade your privacy There are hopes and the law can be delayed 2 years so who knows things might turn around Welcome to the server @asherella-is-a-dork Favorite book and LI? 👍 Everyone feels differently about everything ~~as long as it's the right opinion~~ Isn't 1h and 30m enough? If you say so I haven't watched it so I can't really have an opinion on it Was it meant to be tho I don't see it as if it was aimed on holywood level, just more like a cool way to show your album Bruh kyo Vietnam 1969 Oh wow Do you know which side? War is brutal Yeah, there are many people missing after wars but not necessarily dead There aren't many veterans after ww2 left although there are a few The last veteran of ww1 died in 2012 Well no war was needed but it happened A thing that is good to mention is that it wasn't only north vs south Vietnam was also fighting for its independence It did have capitalist reforms so no it's not communist anymore Just partially But the ideology will never die itself I'm afraid >oddly enough we all have lives outside of the internet Some Go Fem Avery Lol ......

Texas is big lol Ok but why isn't it a location? How is it not, it's a state Just like the other states in America Confuse ``Texas is the second largest state in the United States by area and population`` Literally the wiki I didn't, wiki has always been reliable for me Plus I didn't hear Texas from wiki I think you're just trolling at this point Where did you see a map of the states without Texas Really? Send one map That's not a map of the states It's a map of the country Lmao how funny It's North Mexico North North Mexico provinces So doesn't every other state in this map lol And so doesn't new York, California and the rest I said one map of the states Not a map without them That's not America I don't seen the name of the US written anywhere It's just some area America doesn't exist Trump is a senator in that Mexican province North Mexico There is no new Mexico It's just another fiction Looks at Texas just in the east There's no usa Just autonomous provinces of Mexico Donald Trump is a Twitter comedian and a fictional president Then new Mexico isn't too tho Lol *I never said that* Wow it does, thanks yeah ik now Plus it's kinda disrespectful My parents and I clean the house Then some people get inside with their dirty shoes Ofc I wouldn't let them in with shoes Like we don't even ask them to take off their shoes They just know it since that's just the way Stank out what Literally no feet smell You must've not been showering for a week To have your feet stink bro @BigHutchHO we give the guests flip flops on or something of the kind Not with socks only inside We have tons and they only put them on while theyre inside I also am given flip flops when I get in another house Then I just leave them by the door And done I'm shook Brits let people in with shoes They're the least I expected it from Grim feet? Flip flops No These aren't the flip flops I mean They're covering most of the feet ,im covering flip flops They don't have this behind Only in the front Yes I wear these all the time in the winter at home They're for home only Not outside Ive been wearing socks at home since last week because it started to feel cold It's like for 2 seconds Literally And if you wear socks even better you aren't showing feet That's weird I find slippers in various sizes ... I don't know UK shoe sizes 15 is something babies would wear here Or very little kids So we Def have big differences That's practically impossible You can't have 54 Maybe we don't use European? Idk There aren't shoes 50 size It's impossible to have 54 Big foot is that you Oml Not expensive Tbh Most of the shoes were used before No they just became little one for my parents and I Or just became old They don't have to be new They just have to be shows Slippers Perhaps I find it just like a thing everyone should do out of a gesture It sure does Nobody ever asked us to get inside with shoes And that's good because I just cleaned Well yeah Unless someone is using the same footwear inside and outside Big F Happy birthday! @✧*ᴍɪᴋᴀᴇʟᴀ*✧ ~~She's the collateral damage of the prenup tho~~ Wow Let's switch weather then Drew It's cold and cloudy here I take the hot weather .tell 90F in C ...

And what is g go @Deleted User I'll send you in Siberia You'll like it there Nice nice Is this the Mario kart game for phone? Oh... Nobody told me... Lazy What It's not illegal That's for sure But it's not what I meant That they can't consent from another point They're just at their horny age they could fuck a tree It doesn't mean they genuinely can consent What else could it be I didn't say as the word of the law I meant more biological I said it's not about the law It's a more biological point view Yeah anhiro understood my point I mean while I agree with some points on anhiro there are many teens that would do it with a teacher if got the opportunity The laws here allow it above the age of 14 but I disagree because teens are just being in their horny age and would do lots of things And I'm a teen and realize the consequences of sex that it can lead to unwanted pregnancy and that there is a lot of responsibility But that's more of the social awareness 20 pages tf @DaHomieDrew Wdym Everyone is still typing handwritten assignments It would be cool if my school allowed printed essays @DaHomieDrew writing ok point still stands So in some schools you can just print your essays? That's nice My school does only with rare projects Because we need pics there but otherwise everything else we do is handwritten Wow Also this year our school enforced grades being showed online only Dammit my Fs in Maths will be exposed Uh Our school Is like one of the most elite in town And most schools still don't have what we do In my country Second world We develop yet But I doubt every school here will have online grades any decade soon considering the rural schools And we have IT classes at least Which are kinda useless @literal legend. That's not wrong I'd still like it if we could print this stuff My handwriting succ . Hilda @DaHomieDrew I mean We don't have a working printer at home Too much money My mother at work has one If I need something printed She is an accountant and uses printer all the time there after all We used to have a printer which is older than me now It's very usual for me I mean I haven't had to write on 20 pages like hilda Like wtf which human would assign that My essays are only in-class But damn this online grade thing is annoying Last year only few teachers used it now it's enforced for every Nah Only my parents and I Nah my parents This is Maths 2 equals F Next week I'll have another Maths test thanks But one of the most strict teachers I have is in Maths rip I still don't understand the passing system in america @DaHomieDrew Like you get something under the passing grade what happens then Which means? :GWinfxThink: Here you can get Fs but if you get too many the average might get too low and get under the passing grade for the year and then you either get mercy from the teacher or have to study in the summer to go on a testing to improve your grade and if you fail that you repeat f Geometry is my favorite part of Maths @Deleted User dw same It's my favorite part because it's where I get the highest grades I don't remember what I liked in elementary But i was a good student, my grandma kept me in check There is a school that studies French and Spanish in my city but I preferred the one with English and German @DaHomieDrew Which subject do you have the most strict teacher on? For me it's the biology teacher and I totally get you Foreign languages are my favorite One of them why do you think that Oh That doesn't really make you a horrible person Nobody should be forcing you to know more languages seems hard for me Welcome @Smithy7 Favorite book and LI? Nice Tctf is really good eiko I thought nobody went for Eiko but she's dominating the polls rn I mean I haven't really formally decided who to go for But most likely Eiko as for the polls Seems that way I think benji meant eiko :yob: Every time I look at the server picture It seems like I have a ping Welcome @TheMusicEvangelist oh 🤔 Do yall switch time one hour behind too?

They must've banned mine It worked pretty well on chapters Tbh I used to have this fear with choices quite often Happened on storyscape instead I used to have cheat engine on my phone but didn't have many apps at the time so I deleted it It's another hacking app but it's for changing numbers Like money in-game stuff I could try that with Storyscapes seeing their security system it won't work But it's not like my account is very useful now Yeah only thing you'll have to do Is change a little from the value Like buy the cheapest thing or anything just change it slightly Then you can change it to whatever you want In my case I'm going to watch an ad in storyscape well then The nostalgia from cheat engine is back It doesn't from from the pc I should try the mobile app My emulator is rooted yeah Welp I tried to no avail, seems like there is no way to bypass it currently oh Who is who?

Whoa How to explain a feeling Should I open my chest while reading the book or I can explain it as much as why I like PM If I enjoy reading them I don't see why I should "bring in the facts" and explain why I suppose it's because I've never had an expectation that it will turn into some action book that involves robbery or smth Feels like the reason why people generally hate HFTH, expectations It's just a holiday book it wasn't meant to be something big Why do you like books? You either enjoy them or not HFTH had nothing new from other books so ofc the reason I'd like it is because I enjoy it HFTH was just HFTH, you like some characters and dislike others like any other books The true nonsense is having to explain why you like a book but ok How am I the one making it complex I just said I like the book I enjoy it It's as least complex as it can get Because it's tasty Because I enjoy listening to that music Simple and fair Most stuff what isn't rock is fine I'm literally saying that lol @BigHutchHO why? When? How? Explain yourself To be not boring duh Obviously Wouldn't like it if it bored the hell out of me The fact that I read every book and this one was one of the enjoyable to go through Alright It's your opinion Hold it I remember the book well I like it because I liked reading through it simple as that Just like most of the other books I like About time you realized how dumb it is And everytime I talk around you I feel like I'm talking to a teacher Having to write essays why I have an opinion on a specific question :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: Could've said it in DMs if you really cared that much not someone else to say a word Funny who says it hi You're flexing :GWczeAngryCry: You can turn off google chrome as a game in settings zoomerdance Interesting You're just a big gamer viv Playing that game google chrome all the time I'm also playing it at the moment Cool game Literal zoomers Just accept zoomers And you can get off it If I was born before 2000 i'd just classify myself as a zoomer Wait what Aren't zoomers before 1998 wtf Wait wait What is millennial then I thought we all were millennials here wtf I thought zoomers was the generation before us It's not boomers It's impossible because boomers ends in 1964 When tf are milennials And if zoomers are till 2014-2015 What is the next generation :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: Who is after z tho Isn't z after 2014 How tf nobody I mean 1995-2014 @♡ lilli ah so it's alpha gen Should've said that earlier I feel bad for alpha Imagine being born in generation alpha 😂 yes what does karen generation mean Isn't this our generation tho "Want to speak to the manager" This is something I can easily use for generation z I don't get it I understood what it meant Basically high expectations? And getting angry when they don't get met? oh god I mean these kind of people always exist Especially our edgy generation Which thinks they can do everything with no consequences My mother is exactly the opposite of that lmao Can't relate I think my aunt is a total karen tho My dad is 68 My mom is 75 @DaHomieDrew bruh If I wanted kids I'd do it before 30 But nah I wouldn't want to give a life to someone in the next hell generations I'm more leaning on not wanting a kid atm Teenagers are kchh t. a teenager It's hard to raise a teen Even if you have good intentions Yeah def Hey, he's back! hey mad Ooh @DaHomieDrew I don't remember this song Ah, it's been long ago @Water Puppies cmon if we're overtaking an server it's gotta be active What's the point of taking over a quiet server A server can be active with 3 people Depends on the company ~~why jk~~ I'm in emoji servers Don't type in them at all I also was in servers where I wanted to be active But got lazy So I basically don't open them atm I've had 2k @Water Puppies you don't have to ask It's a public space hoe I'm almost equally active during school and breaks Imagine working This post was made by the students gang @♡ lilli no shit Actually I'm not young and wtf I'm not in Belgium I'm in Bulgaria jesus christ you made the same mistake as fox Fox news once said PM of Belgium instead of Bulgaria Thought it was only them But yeah @BigHutchHO imagine having to work Anything is better than working Unless I win the lottery and open a business @Strife But that's just dreams @BigHutchHO You can fianancially cover everything and not work? Lucky af if you can wat WTF And the government pays you that much?? 500 pounds this is like 1100-1200 leva It's still surprising That the government pays you for unemployment People here get small amount for disabillities Because usually companies are forced to employ disabled people who can work Which is kinda stupid Companies with over 50 personnel Yeah but forcing it is a bit dumb not even bit Like if they want to get the job they get it despite how much they are capable of it If I couldn't work I wouldn't but sadly I have to start as early as possible to get a pension didn't have to work* Boring life > Stressful life Most students work as waiters or baristas here So that's what I'll probably do Sucks to work one of these because of human social interactions But what else can a student work I doubt any college job would be accommodating for me but I'll have to afford the tuition still direct human interaction Drinking age here is 18 so that should be fine Me too Cleaning, home, tech Tech support is fine Online tech support Oh yeah @DaHomieDrew That would be cool Finding bugs in games It's not that kind of human interaction I'm talking about human interactions with 300 different people everyday If it's a small group of people it's fine No big deal, I'll get used to that It's not that pretty but it can be still cool you'll test games in early stages of development Meaning bugs etc I don't want a relationship I adapt when I talk to these people often I don't think I have something that is curable by medicine I mean the social anxiety disorder itself It feels easier talking with adults than kids my age Yeah same drew I don't think I have the actual condition just being a weirdo Cyberpunk 2077 is coming in 3 months hold on Wait really? That's pure masochism To put yourself through something like that Yeah I'm glad to have my free time yet, even if limited when going to school will do College life seems stressing Hard studying, working where is the free time in this If you work, do you really tho? Never I go to school even if sick lol Unless I have temperature Many classes can be skipped in university from what I've heard with no consequences but I'd rather not music classes are a total joke I think that next term we won't have this clownery I have to make a presentation with 20 pages and learn it for a grade? That's total bullshit In music class, presentation These classes shouldn't even be graded Just like before Solo Word, then print it And learn it all 20 pages just for a music class I'm trying to learn this nonsense Like My problem isn't with making a presentation It's just that it's for a music class Out of all classes Also aren't sometimes university classes all day?

They expensive Most of the schools here are public But my school is too proud For being considered elite Our private school is based on msths .

Because that's what I meant Well for your environment Well if it's making fun of other people it makes you an asshole to them, you most likely don't even know the causes Meanwhile you know yourself well big mood .

I mean I can probably find it in torrent websites This sounds interesting We usually don't buy cake because dad makes one My parents are literally the opposite They never get touched by anything in a movie and might start talking in the saddest moments Military themed movies are cool And I watch stuff with my parents because it feels boring sometimes when I watch alone Even if the movie is good I also like to bond with them yeah not really i forget them too quick to affect me for longer than 5 minutes I often have nightmares about being late to class I'm rather glad when i wake up tho lol Mine once was that my father drove my family(??) to school but he was taking the longest route possible and I was late we doing a crusade I see Wow I hope you recover from it Australia exists?

This makes it sound like a scientist saying it OH GOD Sweet Alabama Ew I mean Alaska is cold af With that depressing weather no doubt there are suicides It's like the Nordics It's not getting that warm drew Temperature doesn't increase that much @Tyr used to be No Cringe flag @Tyr ye Honestly I don't know why America was interested in buying it Yeah cheap but just a cold land that doesn't even border America What Zee is the younger Youngest ??? I'm turning 18 this year tho Sadly Wat That would mean I'm like 100 years old Doesn't mean I'm old Just a bit grown up Yes zee is turning 16 in November 14 I was like 7-8 year old when I had FB for the first time My mom made it Yeah she was  @Tyr @♡ lilli bruh I have been using pc since 4 My parents introduced me to it and all My brother introduced me to some 2000s games like gta My first console was ps3 in 2014 Specifically for gta 5 I was hyped for it Oh I also won a psp In middle school It was from a giveaway from waffers Ah remember when Skype was the real shit Everyone had Skype before discord I used Skype last two years ago Then discord came along All my Skype friends had discord So yeah I loved discord I had it because of a Skype online friend Then entered a cs go server And then I realized there are discord servers for everything Don't know what ICQ is Windows XP Xd Windows 10 is the best windows we've ever had you can't change my kind It was good Like second best My pcs were xp - 7 - 10 What is VCR Hmm Can't remember this Bruh I had a normal monitor Ever since I had pc *throws away furi's VHS tapes* Money money money Well if I'm honest everyone other than me and furi in this chat has to sleep atm tbh 8:39 here You mean 0:29? It's not military time Stupid Americans It's used by literally almost the whole world Well it's not an American system Ye What kyo said Yes faeri Good job Hey you stole my pun furi I feel robbed Stealing isn't kyoot furi xD Joker movie was cool I'm already at school :/ Gn Hahaha Imagine... Imagine having maths next class like me right now Bruh Kidnap me True School is a waste of time University is also a waste of time But I need that degree It's still a waste of time It teaches you useless things as school At I doubt there are universities about such things You just know the languages or you don't Oh Well I can't even speak English right xD I'm studying German and it's hell Don't be like doge I didn't have a choice furi... The only way to have English as major foreign language was German as second Or the other way is having French/Spanish as major That's just how schools were set up It's not deliberate There was also a possibility of picking German as major but nah didn't troll myself that bad I wouldn't mind learning Spanish I went to Austria and was barely able to greet the people there :GWcorbinTopKek: Oh well gtg Thanks Obviously not I remember when everyone had free nitro for months due to being given a link to gift nitro I'd say it's not recommendable if it's not for androids There are some that might be directed at us instead of apple It most likely won't But BOLAS and TRH 2 will Tbh it depends on which book has the best cover for me AB can't make it because it won BB will make it but I don't like the cover I hope TRM makes it Ye Not this month It's just for the last book that won What? That wasn't last month tho right? Then why does it matter? What I hope Is that AB doesn't make it to March We have so far faces only I believe Oh well then I personally think they're done announcing leaks and next announcement is for the release of the book *Monday please* Alright Shouldn't matter for us as long as we do it fairly after all oh shit really? Why is this sever icon Also can we just have a vote next month where we pick server icon gif between different choices gifs like marrying ES LI, Duffy in Vos etc? There are chances and even then it is better than a gif that just changes two pics tbh I mean I just kinda find it weird that's all Maybe we should vote on it? You just found that out? I'm pretty sure Apple users can do it too Which phone wouldn't let you change ringtones I had that app for wallpapers uhh let uberbot decide? .choose Ok then .choose bring back static icon, keep gif Hmm it depends on the moving icon imo In choices they do sometime The animations and all Yeah agrees Agrees Agreed* The Duffy animation would be an epic server icon *seems like we'll need a vote on whether we should have votes* xD Tfw you make a referendum but it gets 50/50 votes so a bot in the end decides it Shows how much influence bots have :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: Lol Canada America Bots are taking over this server They are aware they're being used 🔌 Oo Detroit become human I hope to be able to play Detroit become human soon I really don't notice when I have new pimples I just let them go themselves Animated icons for books sound like a pretty good idea And I think they're quite noticeable with me I don't track them but I do have quite a lot of small ones Puberty and all Yeah when puberty ends My brother used to have a lot of pimples Like more than you could imagine Then he started eating chocolate more moderately And they just died out So I suppose chocolate can contribute to acne I didn't know this contributed too ~~I like staying up tho~~ Welp Well duh Everyone shaves I mean of course they shave, it's just a basic bodycare I shave my legs only in the summer The other times it's just useless Exactly me too It's awful I hate winters I love heat Like 30C It's great Yes it is I'm jealous Viv We have 30 only in the summers... In the winters we have to suffer I go to school at 0C It's not although I think clean looks better, that's what I do My eyebrows grow too much He wouldn't look bad if he shaved too tbh . I prefer miles Joseph My goal is to survive I will know if I've completed that goal by the end of the decade I thought your sister was married Benji @azula do you mean Beyonce It's possible That's for having a direct baby tho Isn't surrogation a good option for infertiles? Oh So are you going to adopt? We also have abandoned babies despite abortion being legal I gtg hmm Yup Heard of it This is why some devs removed DRM from their games t. Life is strange before the storm And a lot of the times denuvo gets broken through Just takes more time Like I heard RDR2 is a very big mess For people who have bought it So people meme about how both pirates and buyers can't play rdr2 memes are peak point of humanity I think I just found a bypass with which I can play detroit become human Yep Basically you install the demo version in the epic games store Download the torrent with the game(original, just unlocked, therefore doesn't generally work) and paste it Epic games fixed it but apparently it works again Like they pulled the game out of the store for a few days Before I could exploit back then But now there is some update that it works again Epic games what can you say about them They give away many games for free I have batman arkham from them and many others I don't know They even gave away the wolf among us for free 👀 I hope the exploit works I generally would just watch all the endings in youtube That's what I do With other interactive games @Tyr oh yeah there are many people I mean there are some that go for non commentary playthroughs I mostly watch these To see other choices I only watch gameplays if it's to see alternative routes @DaHomieDrew yeah constantly pausing the game, talking Bitlife playthroughs are fun to watch Especially when someone goes for the evil path Do it, I'd watch it mobile app or pc? telltale games would be amazing XDD Is it? I've been considering it 👀 Might do it after I finish 2003 cod lol It's called just call of duty ye I've never played cod so I just decided to play them all xd COD 1 has also British and Soviet campaigns or? Well finally some time to spend me some quality time in the eastern front oh boy that's gonna be fun and yeah thanks again drew Are these in cod 1 or separate games tho? nice I'm gonna install it after I finish here Battlefield has no real shit about the eastern front And cod here they are having it in their first games Interaesting @DaHomieDrew the pun remains good nonetheless don't drew-uin it for us cmon guys it was good drew-eally? Yes... Till September right? sad I'm sad but I can wait There is a lot of fish out there who knows cyberpunk might be the best game of 2020 what I do know is that with the new consoles coming out there will be lots of announcements for new games Hey rae, how arae you doing @Tyr life is strange 2? Why :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: I bet zamunda still has it So I wouldn't worry if I want to install it again @red hot silly pepper doing good @Tyr best website alright, I'm warning you that you might not be able to run it out of bulgaria although a turk I know was able to so it's 50/50 https://zamunda.net/bananas if it doesn't run I can just get the torrent there for you nice There is also zamunda.ch if I recall correctly This is closer to you and in case something happens Then again it's the 6th most visited website in Bulgaria :LMFAOdead: :Pirate: I live near the coast for a reason In the winter I try my pirate skills digitally Happy birthday!

(you can say two angry Slav men now) Оh 👀 . @Tyr i just finished firewatch good game Yeah Jan sounds cool I don't think I've had one We do too In Bulgaria we have three names First is personal Middle is named after your father Father sorry* And third is your surname Which is your father's surname Same case Names are gendered They have female and male versions Ivan and Ivanka for us For example if your dad is named Ivan Your middle name is Ivanov Or Ivanova if female I'd say it is but it's not a typical slavic name Like it's widely used it's just not a slavic name wow And in Slovakia you have no surnames? Ah because you just said only one name Ah yeah I was surprised when I found out some countries don't have a middle name Like I saw a personal name and surname and was wondering what the middle name was when I was a kid I don't know how it is with all slavic nations I only know Russia and Bulgaria have middle names and Slovakia not Hmm not necessarily here but we do have names like Maria Joan We have some Filips xd here are basically the most popular names in bulgaria lol I thought Nikola would be way higher Dude I know at least 4 Nikolas And all are from schools I've attended ah yes nikola tesla Al-tear?

We may have different definitions of freezing zee It was 20C this week And in the end of FEBRUARY Damn Let's switch places You can go to beaches in December But yeah I also heard somewhere else that the summer will help dealing with it But I can also imagine many people travelling in the summer China and the US allegedly have a vaccine Yeah I heard that conspiracy and the reasoning was to decrease population But I doubt it Yeah I heard I'm not panicked tbh Yeah I also hope they close schools Might as well link it with the spring break Yes I mean We don't know if the dog will survive The one that is infected That typo tho :weird: Nooo why did the good GWs die out too Don't tell me I have to stick to the general emojis :GWcorbinTopKek: :GWczeAngryCry: Only these are alive :GWmythiFeelsBadMan: oh Stop flexing :GWskaipAngry: :GWczeAngryCry: You have to buy me nitro every month now mara It's a part of the EU-UK negotiation law ma'am In a moment I'll show it I can't do that This is government secret It is But they don't show the whole document Yeah We're returning death sentence Torture is an option too Or seizure of your assets Your property and wealth I can With the communist revolution everyone will have discord nitro Yes But everyone will be able to afford discord nitro Much educate such wow :weird: https://tenor.com/UYD8.gif Nice Should I nickname myself DaHomieDrew I'm in ~~once again~~ Oh yeah Yes in another server But never here It should happen Hey!

Nice Skye is indeed one of the best 12am for viv? But isn't this 11pm for you Damn timezones are confusing It should be 3 am for her no? Anti ethan coalition This is how democracy works benji Also our privileges were cut off with removing our OG roles The privilege of being OG and getting your color of your choice With hashtags We'll probably come back to school on March 30 Kinda doubt it Can wait to be 18 17 November rip Aren't you around the same age Ah alright Zoomer Wait it's actually not hilda It's zee She's the same year as Hilda but she's November Hey viv How did it go Oo Interesting 51 for here And the lockdown will probably be like Spain viv You'll still be able to go for groceries if that's the case ^ We don't want another Italy and Spain Damn I forgot my English textbooks in school I don't think so, plus I wouldn't be able to write on English textbooks Seems like I'll have to do them when we're back Damn The books are safe at least, they're in my locker Printing can be costly I had to print two whole books But it's nothing much since mom did it in her office Her boss is the one paying xd Damn Why didn't you just ask your friends to ask their dad to print for you Yeah but didn't you answer why There wasn't need to censor it btw We're all used to them Just heads up Glad my mom works in an office Our school doesn't have a printer sadly If you don't have a printer you'll have to go to a book store They usually agree to print for some very little cost The printer we had is probably older than me The microwave and fridge are sure older than me Yeah they do Ours shall die one day Remember when I said that my English books are at school? Unintentionally a classmate just showed a picture of the task to ask the teacher if that's it I probably will but today, not much Careful furi Or I'll be the one with the knife You don't know that furi My father is a chef Making him weaker Okay then I'll attack your dad first I'll cough on him What, you think my father will abandon me? Oh Sorry to hear If you say so Alright then https://tenor.com/W6fa.gif What furi is actually doing irl when threatening people on discord It's literally you Who is this you post in #irl-squad Your grandson? Back 50 years ago? How old are you? Why did you look like that when you were 25 then? What happened? @Deleted User true Also does that mean that furi lived in czechoslovakia? But it did 70 years ago And when you took that video Weren't you in my family tree Yes you're my grandpa xd It's the truth You're truly my grandfather Someone in one should add you with your consent And as who daughter, parent Furi it seems like you'll have a great granddaughter She died From old age You live too long furi @kaitoo minimal salary I want to know too tho Nah I don't wanna bet If I get a pic does it help? Oh yeah Priyudi can get one It doesn't look bad rn Bruh I hope they extend our break For now my break is till 29th... Distance education Today it went really bad Servers crashed from too many requests Eventually they fixed it but it took them 3 hours And rip xbox Introverts rose up in these times We always controlled the internet 62 cases and 2 deaths for us Wow I wonder if they're gonna do another lockdown here It seems inevitable with these idiots going out just for fun About the case in my city the guy attended a wedding in Spain, passed through Italy and reached here There are measures taken here But not full lockdown Also people from most infected countries are banned to come starting tomorrow These travels should stop Idk about here National emergency was declared on march 13 for one month so probably is till april 13 But we probably haven't seen it all yet Yeah Glad my dad started buying lots of food like few weeks ago I was laughing at him then but look at the situation now That's how it starts usually Just one person gets infected and operation blown up Problem is you can have the virus and never feel any symptoms And you spread it to people who can take it very badly And there is still flu going on in my city Although decreased The thing is that the countries with most cases in Europe were the ones who started checking not only people who travelled Like with Italy and Spain Spain started testing people even with lighter symptoms and they got 2k new cases in one day Yeah Spain too now Iran was hiding But the truth came out in the end I just checked My spring break is supposed to be April 11 - April 20 We should link it up At least for two weeks we use online too No video calls tho I'm surprised Do yall get video calls? They just send some stuff to write Sometimes also send them something back @Strife nice Better way of catching up with material i'd guess They said they don't plan to cancel the school year Are cameras mandatory? Tough times At least you didn't use servers I hope I don't have anything to motivate *myself* Get up from that chair and start studying! xd Also another thing Countdown To get up suddenly and start studying like count 3 2 1 And you immediately getting up 5 seconds rule You can become rich by studying To get good qualifications Exams can be useless And yeah they will surely add maths to your studying At least for one semester There won't be but they still add it This reminds me I have a discord bot Yeah there are courses Just be careful with which language you pick Versions, all this stuff I use python too You know This is making me nostalgic I'll get back to python I went to a course on html/css i wish we did good coding All we did is use something for websites That isn't code This should be in 2nd grade tbh Damn, nice I think the best way to get some good programming skills is with some stuff from the mathematics school And I'm not touching that school I used c++ for discord bot Until the new version came out I'm also learning java @Andromeda 0 Just this year I still think about it I'm definitely going to try for an uni tho I just tried my discord bot and it's working Tomorrow I'll try with updating it and stuff Cya priyudi We can still try cya thanks I also have to get back to the 200 paged book I have about java ... Also you jinxed us again paige I'm going to jinx your life smh paige And the truth is Uberbot doesn't have humor He just treats people badly What an ego Right @UB3R-B0T you suck If you don't wanna live just wake up after 300 years We 21st century squad will be like medievals to them As if someone from the 18th century wakes up today I loved ES We need a book with a similar concept If a PB spy is listening I heard about that inception movie Well I'm still in quarantine There's time Hmm Go go we're going to discuss movies in a dead book channel It's dead anyway Wow Link? Thankoso Damn Boi he worked with the Russian mafia Yeah there are lots of reddit videos on yt I check them myself sometimes too Why :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: Wow Is upbeat a bot Guessed so hey Online school is chaotic Yeah we also don't have web cams Just sending stuff Same I thought a video call would be better than what we have Because they can give new stuff this way You're not going to lose much compared to people who attend online school Here goes first city in a lockdown in my country Bulgaria  @Bloodfairy Thanks, I will Damn that's very important Why do you think you're pregnant? Damn AB MC should be taking examples That wouldn't be very cool at this moment If you are pregnant viv you need to feed the fetus People aren't allowed to visit restaurants here, orders still happen but only because we aren't on lockdown My dad works in a restaurant tho xd If someone isn't feeling well, we're digging under the basement In Spain, there is a lockdown but you can leave to get food Isn't it the same in the Philippines too? I doubt they're just going to keep everyone that much at home That's what they advise for here 2-d My dad went to buy lots of food today I mean it's not like it's something special ^ Is it possible to get a pregnancy test? For me staying at home is pretty much what I planned for the break when it was supposed to be just for the flu 🤷‍♀️ They say the peak of the virus is gonna be in the fall Bye bye exams Big oof No viv don't It's not the best time to get an allergic reaction Don't Hospitals are super busy viv And it's never worth it To get an allergic reaction When did they expire? What? I doubt the chips will be really bad They are made in factories and have tons of junk that makes them stand for lots of time Not as much as burgers in mcdonalds but still Definitely not the peanuts I doubt there will be any real consequences and if they taste good enough for viv to eat them Just don't touch the peanuts She's allergic to them It's gonna get hard to get attention if you don't have some infection especially covid19 In a lockdown city Yeah Well, there are some hospitals that have emergency rooms, all you have to do is hope there aren't too many cases of corona... We have to hope it doesn't have to come to us going to a hospital Let's hope in 9 months the situation is at least slightly better I wonder if I can check that about every country somewhere Aho HP Sup Outdated joke Good one And you got it .convert 1 mile in km .tell 1 mile in km It's not that far Why make a point Some people simply use superior measures and need to convert Yes Doesn't literally almost the whole world use km I think it's just like how Americans use Fahrenheit Weird stuff Just use uberbot That doesn't seem right But Celsius also matches with Kelvin The real og One Celsius is equal to one Kelvin 273 is the Celsius 0 But that's the only difference No that's not true One Celsius is technically equal to one Kelvin But they're made to start at a different point So like the Celsius 0 is the 273 Kelvin Yeha Yeah Exactly my point That's because of the absolute zero tho While if we compare it with Fahrenheit it's the unit So it depends on what principle you say it Bruh fuck physics Still easier than chemistry But still Geez Everything maths related is bound to be bad I don't know hindi I'm doing relatively fine in Bulgarian I don't get maths at all which is the problem I know what it is I said I don't know the language Although I've heard many people in India actually can't speak hindu Hindi Damn these southerners I shall always trash math It was a joke priyudi My first problems with maths came in 6th grade lol My mother is so bad at math along with me She tried to help me and in the end we were helping each other mutually back in 7th grade I mostly studied alone but with maths the situation was tragic back then and I had an important exam that yesr So she decided to help I wish my mother was very good at maths To help me My dad is sure a lost cause My brother pays in uni to get past math My family is full of proud math haters Xd No idea Damn Mara I also wish I had the same birthday as a dictator I'm jealous Bruh On my birthday in 1916 the US declares war on the Dominican Republic How interesting Oh declares martial law Not war Well then I have the most boring date On my birthday it was the coldest day in the Netherlands Cmon why do I have so much boring stuff I'm looking at it Literally nothing interesting On my birthday USSR broke off diplomatic relations with Finland The war is in December 1 so meh Oh wait Tito formed his partisan government on my birthday That's cool So I do have a dictator on my birthday doing stuff @Tyr yes Respect for pluto Time to quarantine the server xd I'm at online school Math "party" Yup After completing a chapter Hey There are barbie movies? Should've guessed I've played TWD No way I don't One of the best games ever Ikr! You're making me want to replay it smh I've played almost all telltale games Just except the games of thrones Stay safe The wolf among us is also very good TWAU 2 hype Omg I didn't notice wtf I thought you meant appearance wise but that is also accurate If Damien was as badass as bigby tho Bigby and snow is possible, now with TWAU 2 *we should get it now because we're all in quarantine* Quarantine is going great for me Oh man I remember when they shut down telltale And TWD 4's fate was unknown It was at episode 2... The tension there was I always needed a reason not to go out I just open the windows Good enough compensation for me I haven't been outside in 3 weeks Yes First because of the flu Now because of the corona spread I don't know yet They say 29 march but seeing how things go It will definitely be extended My break started 2 weeks ago when there was a flu epidemic Hence why it's so long It wasn't intended for corona but corona was the reason it was extended So yeah I'm living the introverted life greatly If we only didn't have that useless distance studying A curfew is already proposed here This is one step closer to lockdown Can't say they'd be wrong, cases are rising quick 105 105 is big for us because we're a smaller country Plus that's just the confirmed cases Exactly No it's not the end of the world I don't know how it is here exactly Haven't had to be tested For corona In my home, only my dad is going outside Yeah You won't die in most cases My grandmother has been at home for almost a week now Yeah And in some cases You never have symptoms But you still spread it But I doubt I have corona and if I did it would be from my parents lul I'm not My mother is panicking unnecessarily tho They're doing that everywhere It's stupid *just join the bidet gang* Oh yeah I saw something about that To fight off the zombies that are going to come from covid xd The city that is in a lockdown had a bread shortage today Oh yeah xd It's good that we don't buy bread And we make one at home It seems like brits *finally* started panicking a bit It's seem like they finally started taking measures Late but still better than never A british fb group even took bulgaria as an example of fighting the spread of the coronavirus xd At least on lockdown, air will become clean xd The situation in China is overcome 83% recovered No, just remaining cases That are to recover And also only new 13 cases yesterday, 12 of which were from foreign countries Europe now has more deaths than Asia Tbh there are too many clips to watch of this situation Can't know which one specifically you're talking about rn They will party in hospital beds the next week The problem here is that elders keep going out The most vulnerable And are still going out.. Ikr I see elders from my window casually going out These measures are literally to protect them tf Not just for them to go out Oh nice, we have 2 new cases other than the 13 new ones 107 now My city has 3 and all of them travelled.... Damn I wish I met introverts irl xd I can Extrovert hating everyone? 🤔 But I'm preparing the best excuse for being lazy to send homework to the teacher already i just forgot it at home 👉 Ask for videochat? It can be done online tho Oh shit Can't you ask to be the one going out for a change? To go to the bank? You'll probably need that bank deposit for way more than a therapist Nah This server is yours viv You won't die Not letting it happen You're staying in our world I mean your dad isn't being exactly wrong priyudi Hiding or not Lockdown can happen #CancelDistaceEducation Rip celebrating Easter Now I'll miss out on the eggs Why not? He can't force you to do shit tho Plus There are literally no schools opened Yeah But isn't it delayed Out of how many Jesus christ Good luck indeed Me neither I have lots of things to do But online education limits me a bit There was literally only one useful class this week, where took an actual new lesson, catching up etc At least you have someone to save you in organic chemistry Still better alternative than hitting your head against the wall Tbh if I knew just Maths and Chemistry for a good grade I'd be super happy Lucky My parents don't interfere in this stuff Omg @MaralinaSakura so about what you said few days ago... I don't recall completely But I see the new member is still alive in this server Nah we were talking about the possibility of a member joining and saying they like AB xd Smh guys Stop insulting the Italian https://store.steampowered.com/app/442070/Drawful_2/ it's free now 👀 jackbox scribl.io version you can't play it after that? Welcome @Chaos(beckons) Favorite book and LI? The AB cult You welcomed the new member into that so :GWaobloChildPepeSweat: We stan AB In fact It's not AB anymore, it's going to be BB And Bloodbound will be BBB Welcome to the cult paige Hey don't be rude or I'll call you pagie smh It's a cult after all Are we talking about the same BD? She meant baby bump Not many people would know outside of this server tho I don't think anyone called it baby dump or abortion bump Outside of discord yeah but just once I don't like using BaBu It reminds me of calling grandma because if I refer to my grandma in Bulgarian i say babo So it's close in pronounciation Oh priyudi and I were talking about our languages at the same time xd And I will not call AB my grandmother You can self-assign some in #roles Kinda And it's too long I never use DaDdy just use daddy No need to capitalize D&D requires a whole ass symbol Hard to type on phone #choices-chat Which country are you from, if you don't mind answering? Oh nice, we have another slovak here Hi Nothing much you? I hope he bought something else at least My father also bought lots of stuff He did well because from now on people under 60 can't go to supermarkets from 8:30 to 10:30 Yeah That's to allow elders to buy stuff Apart from other people It is to protect them in the end but it would also mean that if my dad goes to a supermarket in the weekday it will have to be after his work day ends 129 cases 3 deaths But also 1 recovery Good Also other than that supermarket measure There are now checks between cities You need a valid reason to go to another city It's a good thing We need to prevent becoming another Italy People there thought measures weren't needed and things got bad Curfew is only proposed here I hope at this point people here get used to the new measures They also locked down parks and playgrounds so I hope that keeps them at home at least My dad is also still going to work and for my mom it's unknown She will have to go at one point Schools were said to be only closed till 29th when they declared national emergency last week But now it's clear that it's not possible we come back on the 30th with these measures Plus the national emergency is until 13 April They'd probably make some kind of an april 1 joke and tell you they do They shouldn't at least Yeah, I can imagine Our problem is with keeping the elders in They'd have it the harshest if they catch the virus but are the least worried I think we took good measures We don't have daily wages We work based on monthly wages here wtf mara also pharmacies wtf why don't authorities shut it down Who buys games from physical stores anymore tbh Just use steam I use pirating websites + steam My console is cracked too Both of them, actually I started using my PSP more I have a cable for it to download games on it Usually my mother handles my grandma's payments For electricity etc Never used amazon tbh It seems expensive af And half of the products are probably not available for my country Bulgaria Bruh Lol I know you aren't I WANT TO SEE THIS Depends on what you mean by that question Deliveries, sure if they're available for the country But they may cost money Oh no we don't have amazon.bg Most people use amazon.de The german amazon Hence why kinda useless Nah It's not too far but it's not too close But personally I prefer the chad aliexpress Better prices, can find free deliveries BRUH HE PUT AUSTRIA IN MACEDONIA He got spain right Britland xdd Russia is an easy one I know where every country of Europe is in a map Learned it over history After so many maps it's kind of hard not to know bruh I only know there is a city Champagne and Nice in France I'm afraid I can only say where India is on a world map priyudi Nice I don't even know him idk I want to go to Paris once tho I also want to go to Italy but Well not now I live 15 mins away from the beach bruh It's nice Better than mountains There used to be snow years ago I mean it did snow for one day this year But it couldn't hold much So I don't really count it Good riddance I still have bad memories with going to school when it snowed super hard The only good stuff was the snowball fights ...why Once, a snowball went through my mouth The snow reached my throat as well The teacher gave me tea bruh Who didn't put a ball in their stomach to pretend as being pregnant stonks I think I still have lots of 1-2 stotinki in me That I haven't been able to turn into bigger money Stotinki are the coins wdym The coins of our currency You know Like you have p Just like how euro has coins etc What's so weird?

Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down i've seen this one <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ> this is also similar but good hoe money i mean the normal day is also boring just replace online school with actual school nice The new discord design for opening channels on mobile is kinda cringe Makes it seem like it's bugged Have you tried it Welcome @Niko Nice LIS is great I'm modded and skip the diamond choices lol Drew was never modded xd I was about to ^ smh But yeah you did good priyudi It's fine I can't hate WABR more I've reached the limit But it may increase At this point idc what happens if it can end the book ||I'd welcome the mafia to finish their business with MC|| Bruh for me I can't stay up too much because I fall asleep without realizing Gn from me tho I woke up late today and almost missed some stuff As for the test we had one for 40 minutes but it was without grade Still tried to cheat a little so it doesn't seem tragic More and more classes are becoming with videochat here idk if it's better than google hangouts tho Oh shit From now on online education will have grades > are turkish people white Kinda late but many Turkish people identify as white the ones I know anyway They're not really asian and nor is the middle east tbh (turkey isn't middle east) It's not considered as one Not politically i said politically, geographically most likely As in politically Most of the times the middle east is referred it doesn't really affect turkey When people refer to the middle east they mostly think of arabs, wars, human rights being violated a lot Plus Turkey even applied for the EU once although I doubt they'll ever join it And big parts of the population is mixed with the people who lived in these lands before turks (greeks, albanians who immigrated there and many others) On the question of Palestine... Yeah Better not to cause a world war here @Andromeda yeah but if we're honest americans portray continents as one for the most part and it's not just americans who are doing it africa is literally everywhere portrayed as one we study european history and bulgarian history as well of course here it seems like it's 1 year european history and 1 year bulgarian history on loop and 1-6 grade it was bulgarian history all the time lol 7 grade was ancient Yeah tbh only the ones interested learn something from history out of school ~~and you definitely won't learn anything this year~~ me too i'll have to go with modern roman empire is interesting obvs lol ~~fuck byzantines tho~~ Hey we had wars with them for 700 years And then the Ottoman Empire stepped over both of us the wars with the byzantines are fun to learn ~~in the moments where we have the most wins~~ Hear what Hell yeah they almost liberated us siege of vienna intensifies vladislav III died at the battle of varna imagine if he actually won it well the biggest reason western europeans tried to find a way to india is because the silk road was blocked by the ottomans isn't it? when they tried to find a way to india they found north america instead the ottoman empire could've been defeated and return things to normal before this there wouldn't be even ww2 AH, our few allies germany already dealt with russia and the troops from the eastern front were heading to the western front There wouldn't be 1m fresh american troops to save them this time No Canada on that matter too 🤔 but would it be colonized the same way we wouldn't have the same usa i'd bet maybe that's for the better look at the us and uk how similar they are where they got their arrogance from maybe france should've won the 7 years war hey we were the ones ruined from the ottoman empire medieval thinking at least they didn't succeed in replacing the locals everyone was slaves in medieval times tbh crusades were a joke they crusaded constantinople :LMFAOdead: still supposedly did it for the faith yet they just robbed the biggest Christianity stronghold now you see how I feel xd byzantines are the ones who converted us to Orthodoxy and that was 864 orthodox did see catholics as barbarians sometimes because of these crazy crusades armed popes and that fucked us over for 500 years too I still don't get how this had an empire imagine if we could go back to the 14th century with tanks and repel the ottomans but it would buff bulgaria truth is school actually taught me some history school rarely teaches anything I learn lots of history from internet youtube channels etc rarely video games one of the first thing i learned about history is the world wars they get the most mention but are not everything yeah but 16-19 century is also interesting and yeah world wars indeed change us a lot we had the ussr invade us it wasn't because we declared neutrality in 1944 *and you can't really call it liberation if they just put an authoritarian regime* and maybe germany would win meaning bulgaria wins too america aids both sides in the early stages of any war then joins in later and fucks up another bam world influence we joined ww1 in 1915 because germany offered us to return some land while the entente couldn't offer anything They did have one border strike at least I think But The USSR agreed to invade Japan in 1945 and they started The nukes were unecessary They were just a display of power The whole world including USSR declared war on Japan they had no chances eh mainland japan wouldn't have fallen in russian hands Kim Jong Un on two Koreas true that it's definitely not something to praise it wasn't late till ussr had a nuke too 1949 iirc Still can't believe Ribbentrop signed a treaty of friendship with a cocktail Not by much inb4 jfk never dies and in 1964 communist Canada annexes the US That's so HOI4 tbh Despite the fact that the US is becoming the one commie Italians are bad at war They're only good in the kitchen *it's just a joke don't kill me* The slogan make food, not war is a good one anyway I wouldn't mind if you do I'll cook it many people do Yea take a screen of me typing lol nice no biggie you have to do that always anyway 😷 i don't really go out much but i still wash them Always did Even when I was told to go outside what how can you clean your hand just with just water and say you're ready... Yes and I'm asking the same thing Water can't do shit but it doesn't kill the bacteria I'm surprised people didn't use soap before corona yeah there are many things you can infect yourself with not just covid19 Why wash hands for 2 minutes xdd I've never went to a toilet in class although I'd like to try that during a test 🤷‍♀️ I just go to the toilet before school and don't need to while I'm there Also nah 30 secs are enough for washing hands while 2-3 mins are for teeth never heard of that happy birthday thingy More medicine used on the royalty ofc But xd drew I'm gonna copyright strike you You can't just sing happy birthday when you'd like to Doesn't make him less of a royalty he's the one to take the throne after elizabeth dies @DaHomieDrew I bought the song After whoever owned it We'll see about that I challenge her to a duel We'll see about that I have the power of the cough The queen will send the mafia to kill him perhaps i wonder if she'll become the longest ruling monarch in world history she needs 4 years She's in the 4th place rn what mara i knew that lol thanks to wiki Can she at least beat Johann II yeah something like that for louis we were taught about that particular king 26 years but you were wrong nonetheless I don't know I didn't say I'm smart I was just pointing out your war crimes Bulgaria Bruh there are like 40-50 prime ministers Name every British Prime Minister seems like your popcorn will get cold can't put more than 2000 characters oh and forgot the teeth one you deleted FB and downloaded tiktok... epic why didn't they just delay it the situation is crazy in the us Our state of emergency expires at may 13 if it doesn't get extended if they cancel the school year tho we'll try wut? oh he said a name wrong wow I don't think you are They are probably the mean one tho it can be annoying I blocked dyno bot because someone else used it in another server to ping everyone these people are dumb read a book Well whichever you can do Get where ? oh okay it's not even a spoiler as it's just some actor names XDD This reminds me of when I asked my parents what porn was  when I was like 7-8 (didn't watch it but it was mentioned somewhere) blue films? wut? oh how old were you Eh if you were 18 it wasn't that big of a deal to give your mom cigarettes I thought you were like 12-13 and hence why that would be hilarious I don't plan on doing that anyway same My father used to smoke but rarely, mostly when there are guests he quit tho My father wouldn't stop drinking I'm jealous you have parents who don't drink wait really priyudi??? how lucky but i mean there is alcohol everywhere bars etc I rarely see people who smoke mostly on the streets that's where it's more often I'm annoyed with people who sit next to me and start smoking tbh Feel like strangling them Why would I tell someone to move lol Either strangle them or move myself is what I do smoking is forbidden in my school and strictly enforced even outside of it because the school was threatened with lawsuit iirc i don't know anyone who smokes in school Druggies Yeah I hate it Well kicking out students out of class is a necessity sometimes Sometimes they wouldn't just shut up I was answering to priyudi and I don't see how I'm out of topic Even I was kicked out of class For laughing It was in like middle class Middle school* The teacher kept making these funny hand gestures and I couldn't keep my laughter I was kicked maybe 3 times at most In middle school Never skipped classes tho I don't see myself as either of those tho... I know some who fit more than one But for me neither High school doesn't stress me tbh 7 grade was more stressing than high school for me I hate 8 grade as it's the first year of high school here I'm definitely not a hard worker lol But neither do I skip classes Sitting in the back has its pluses You can cheat more easily Nice I sit in the front but it's mostly because I'm short Also same here I've seen stupid theories that corona is here as a punishment for allowing gay relationships So it's influence will likely stay..

Kinda weird to import ludo as a murder game We call ludo "Don't get angry" And wiki says ludo is German Most important thing is It's a classic board game Well no Even if I did it wouldn't be an Indian name Oh Good job bird @Deleted User Quite the revelations :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: Yes I know which day it is because it's Easter tomorrow Yeah, catholic easter orthodox christianity celebrates one week after catholic I'm not the holiday is interesting without the religious part too no, the egg part for example we don't have these more like the egg dyeing the egg competition Welcome @Ellaa I mean it's hard to tell Considering that the audio is changed @azula yeah it's translated mostly well, there are just minor changes to keep it as catchy They put the shittiest movies on the TV most of the times so I wouldn't care Standard of living is different in each country You live in the UK now, it's not about where you're born but where you live Many people want to move to other countries because the standards of living are just better there It's near impossible to happen the other way around It does because for some people it's more affordable to others The average Mexican is way poorer than the average American As I've been saying, it's not the main reason but it's just a factor that plays in it Yes but for some people it's more affordable than others Where do you think more people are willing to spend money for entertainment because they can? the UK or the Central African Republic? exactly @Strife yes but when the average person is poor not that many can think of spending money for entertainment and more about basic needs sometimes you have it less as a choice tho and what if they can't? in some countries the average person is many times poorer than the UK and can barely use money on entertainment this has to consider paying the bills too because they are a priority in spending money and as I said, not eveywhere It's not a yes or no question an american company wouldn't care if a person in the central african republic can spend it they would care more about americans as it's their main fanbase not really if you think about poorer countries it would be way too cheap and there wouldn't be profit Eh I'm not a businessman ~~I hope so~~ Wtf I want to listen to scrambling for batteries now Me too but I'm curious how an audio can make you feel that When you can just pause it and pretend like nothing happened Yes but can't you just pause them And go on like nothing happened hmm well I'm not interested in k-pop anyway but I hope these videos are reported And get deleted soon if they do cause that `` The story follows a New England artist struggling to reunite with his young son after a mysterious signal broadcast over the global cell phone network turns the majority of his fellow humans into mindless vicious animals.`` This sounds interesting actually Maybe I should read it something to do during quarantine same I watch movies but rarely know the names of the actors that play in them Was about to say I started watching these kind of shows later I know most of the characters because of a game with the simpsons I played most of the major characters Not even Homer? I forgot the baby's name The sister is supposed to be smart so yeah I think so How many seasons does it have at this point lol there are still quite many memes with the simpsons as templates That's not a surprising thing, coming from Homer She said a meme template, not the meme itself lmao The freshman series No book had a wedding Only a marriage proposal but that's it But BSC doesn't have a third book :eyez: But it ended in 2007 Or did it Ik Eros Labs That's not suspicious at all That's not impossible You've seen how AI is developing :GWsetmyxPeepoWeird: Welcome @( ˶ᵔ༝ᵔ˶) milquetoast ♡ Favorite book and LI? nice We can basically make a pool of oil now lol 7 cents last time I checked These benefits are short lived does the air really matter if you're inside all the time at home tho lol It's a short lived thing When everything returns to normal the air will be as it's always been You know that's not what I meant paige It's mostly due to the cars It will be very long until we can replace fuel cars with electric I mean it's a dilemma because it's not that easy to stop it No point of the breathable air if I can't go outside And you can always see the stars drew lol There are clouds sometimes but most of the times there's nothing stopping you seeing them well In fact I was watching the satelites yesterday The 5G satelites ~~that give corona~~ back to online school i'll miss school when I'm in uni even if i hate it now Environment would be pretty much the same for me but the stuff you learn like maths.... I love math online classes not only they're 30 minutes but also I rant in the class without anybody hearing me my teacher writes on a desk Well that's why the teacher uses a desk yes she has some app so she recreates it like it's as in school Photomath is best app for homework slader huh It's beneficiary to have a house now https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/muted-celebrations-britain-s-queen-elizabeth-ii-turns-94-n1188576 she did it did they? As for the book coming out it's most likely WEH Since it's already developed and PB said it will release in the spring PB said WEH will come out this spring in the choices insider VIP books are meant to come out later VIP players just get some kind of an early access I know nothing about this book so I'll just wait for release I'll just wait for its release It's not hard Depends on what you define as server binaries I get the OSTs but I don't know if this counts And wouldn't care frankly They 100% should be But what if they're letting the mod be a thing So choices can be more popular I doubt PB knows about this server Although... Nathan the snake thingy was suspicious xd eh I don't think they did I don't remember storyscapes developers in the server It was about another game Moments ?? What I think you're mistaking storyscapes and moments drew The moments developers were in the server but storyscapes never show screen then drew I don't remember storyscape developers in the server That'd be a huge thing No way we missed this yeah I think drew is just mistaking them with the developers of the Moments game Since they entered the server to advertise Moments Oh wait originals That was the game Not moments Still same hat oh wow And I don't think they needed the server to figure out the mod I'm pretty sure they knew about it and without us And they wouldn't be so thankful considering 90% of us used the mod The other small server was so eventful Storyscapes developers, originals developers Cmon PB expose yourselves You're reading this Well...

I see There are just reports of it It's not confirmed it happened But if it does happen that he dies His sister will replace him For now all we see are reports Nothing confirming South Korea couldn't confirm the operation for example I doubt his sister will change stuff much If Kim trusts her then she's not to be trusted Yeah it's going to be the same it's like saying "A Soviet dictator died now I'm going to visit USSR" North Korea is a literal reflection of the USSR If you did that Hyper you'd be imprisoned And probably beaten up Not necessarily He can also be tortured An American tourist in NK But seriously don't go to NK So apocalyptic You forget the fire near Chernobyl Shhh Pretend you didn't ask that I heard radiation spiked up a lot in some countries Due to the chernobyl fires Surprisingly not here The thing is the soviet regime fell not because of foreign influence but because they had a leader who wanted a reform And they controlled many fellow regimes hence why they fell too Meanwhile NK survived that wave "survived" so it's not going to happen soon It did February 2020 I guess we got more time for ourselves at home I'm expecting my grade from the chemistry test I did tomorrow The teacher said she's disappointed with the class overall But I cheated so I hope it's better What did Demi have to recover from What oh Ah I see I've never tried it so idk if I like it As I said, vegetative state is just allegedly by Japan Wouldn't matter either way Something big needs to happen about that Something was deleted here 👀 @Deleted User So you did It's enough to hear that she's his family to know it's going to be bad But I'm not convinced he'll die Welcome @truuaz Read ES It's a nice one Hero is still worth playing tho eh ES is the best Delete it If you want to post discord light theme so much at least spoiler tag it smh People want their vision 100% functional I too get a slight eye ache because it's too bright Especially if you watch it at night I always pick dark theme When I get the option to I'm glad more and more apps get the option for one I think the youtube one is new From around few months ago I'll be your lawyer oh god why even have phone at full bright tho even at night?

Measures became more loosened here and everyone is going outside like there is no pandemic And with combination of warm weather Streets are packed We're going to be fucked That wasn't allowed? tf @Andromeda No I mean that people started massively going out Damn Lots of travelling there specifically Western Europe In Eastern Europe the situation is better People weren't ready In January and February basically nobody gave fuck about the virus It's not just america In all countries dumbasses want to open everything and break quarantine tf I just had a haircut lol My mother always did my hair Before today, my previous one was in march lol People here openly disobeyed the rule for not travelling between cities unless it's for work and during Easter they massively lied and spread the infection more around other cities there are always openings somewhere Yeah I'd be concerned if *wasps* entered my apartment tho I'd lead its way out and if more and more come start taking stuff that can trap them We put traps about butterflies Mostly around places where we keep food that stays for long time like lentils etc the school year is going to end online here Nope, many countries are opening schools Yeah the US for sure for my country it's already decided we're ending online Our matura(statewide exams) are going to happen normally but with less people in one room and 4th and 10th grade won't do them I'm surprised people would allow big exams to be online Oh I'd like it too Thanks I started the app but it seemed to have too many diamond choices Why do you need SAI for this apk? Is it different than modded choices apk? hmm I've deleted the FB app long ago Is this SAI? Okay Alright Thanks for the help Didn't know there was a modded originals I've barely progressed through any story but that was before quarantine Different times now So like in choices I'm fine with keys wow Are the stories good? I mean in terms of writing quality I don't intend on paying for such mobile apps in the first place only good thing from 18th birthday is voting rights Damn Well I guess if you follow well there wouldn't be much of a problem Lol I entered the server before it had the welcome-mat channel Bruh My teacher in german just invited us to a zoom meeting tomorrow I thought schools were banning that app Does zoom have to be downloaded or is there a web version We've only used google meets in other subjects First time with zoom tomorrow Welcome @Nightmind11 tf the originals mod doesn't work Oh wait You had to activate it in the game itself lol I'm playing house on water street The mystery story No joke chapters are short tho i'm with the bias everyone with orange hair can be just called ginger and everyone with actual red hair can be called redheaded @Brohepsi yes obviously Never knew they were considered red lol I think my mother is what you'd call a strawberry blonde Never would think of her as a ginger It's a possibility People go outside here like it's all over because the national emergency ended I mean I doubt the virus will just go away without a vaccine 1 year minimum I mean another thing that is worth mentioning is that even if a vaccine is created it has to start being produced on a wider scale to be more available I wonder if it will become another obligatory vaccine or it will be optional like the flu one In my country some vaccines are obligatory for everyone to take Including the vaccine for tuberculosis which allegedly helps going through covid-19 easier Not confirmed though People are talking about summer season already so I guess we just have to deal with the fact the virus is going to stay for long Quarantine can't go on for too much too A vaccine will eliminate the virus because it prevents people from getting infected That's how many viruses were defeated I mean whether they'll be mandatory after the pandemic Whether they'll be in the vaccination calendar The national emergency ended in my country(the measures still remain) and people are acting like there was no pandemic Massively going out, no distance, no masks @leitgo65 where do you live? Ah My birthday is celebrated with family gathering I can live with and without it Same here Online education sucks I mean I don't *miss* in-person classes I just think they're the better way to go Online tests suck Except for the times where "helping" yourself works Ngl online education did help me with grades in some subjects It prevented tests I would've gotten bad grades on otherwise in school Also got two 6s in German which I would probably never have otherwise I can imagine Doing better in Chemistry than English? English (as a foreign language) is one of my strongest subjects Here passing is anything 2.50+ which equates for 50%+ My parents think I'm in danger in Chemistry but I'm not I'd die if I lived somewhere where you need to do 70% of the test right to pass Damn I mean why do you need a date to enter a class Aren't classes by the usual weekly schedule? Our school day ends at this exact hour lol During online education No Not yet at least Only 3?? I have video meets with most of the teachers The Philosophy teacher sent only one assignment in the last 2 months tho Art teacher gave a group presentation to do once and now again I don't even mind it because it can be with 3 people only and it's an easy 6 Would have never gotten a good grade if it was drawing in class The previous presentation was just 3 slides about a classic artist lol I use the printer mom has at work I mean under normal circumstances you could go to a book store to get it printed but these days nah yeah Plus it would be stupid to go out just for your teacher Under the current circumstances The times where we were hyped for fridays were good times It's an okay song no matter what people are saying about it tbh She also has a song called saturday at least it was a happy song I mean, I don't think it's bad it's just the short chapters Because football is the logical word Foot and ball You kick the ball with your foot America is just trying to be special No idea why We call that sport american football btw meanwhile in football only goalkeepers can use their hands Nobody else Apparently in Canada they call american football gridiron I'm all in for mod feet pic channels hell yes Ok what is this I saw bread being sliced in 8 today I don't know if it counts for murder I wonder too what xd @Weiss tell us This is definitely not Anhiro's pfp Like not even close Wait what This can't be a pufferfish ?? Not a single pic resembles what anhiro's pfp is I still refuse to believe it's a pufferfish How is this thing a fish at all It still looks different Than the one in the pfp I guess... I've seen a pufferfish eating carrot But not a golden one Not a fucking golden one It was a popular meme I saw it in many memes But the pufferfish I saw was not the golden one Well I guess finally understanding what Anhiro's pfp is solves one mystery of the world lel XDDDDDDD It looks like it's about to explode tbh Wait There has to be a video With a pufferfish exploding You must be new to the meme world Hyper I learnt about the pufferfish from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEwR_PSBDek Initially FlyingKitty is a meme genius We need a pufferfish factory Didn't Venice flood too, 2-D?

You have incognito mode in chrome too tho Don't really care at this point tbh There are thousands of apps tracking us One won't solve the issue This tbh I'm just a peasant I don't really have something that interesting for them Well, maybe some people will appreciate it some people in the server have vip Welcome @Deleted User Favorite book and LI? Yeah I also don't think it's covid Bruh all nighter Which time zone is central? @Strife Oh I thought you meant like worldwide I don't really have problems with sleeping because I can't stay awake for too long once I have to pretend I'm asleep lol true Eating a lot of sweet is unhealthy oh Failed attempt of a joke nvm I see what you mean yukki, losing close people sucks and you have my condolences but on the other hand I don't think it's right to ask other people to change anything. There are probably going to be way many triggers irl especially if the lose is recent and changing my pfp wouldn't be really helpful to anything and would rather show that something has to be changed according to how one feels about them(even if without malicious intents) and I don't think the right message to someone dealing with problems is to try to avoid them much. There is also one word that is mentioned sometimes and triggers me because it reminds me of a lost closed one but I still think they should say it and that the right way is to grieve properly. I also don't see what changing my pfp would achieve: I have almost the same pfp every time. Even if I do change it to something feasible wouldn't still the fact that I changed it make it still remind you? So imo it's neither going to help the right way or even the wrong one. Also I think these things should be asked in private although I don't think you have a malicious intent to ask here in public it's just heads up for other times. I decided to answer as I would in private and not be fake in public while also giving just a temporary solution. No hate and once again, my condolences. damn this turned into an essay Hey no bad blood I think you should ask that in #vip-spoilers Nah it's just a heads up @azula Call the police on them Really?? There is nothing like "No loud noises between 22:00 and 6:00"? Damn that's sad @azula Give me address I'll murder your neighbors no I won't murder you I will kill those that make it bad for you instead Your life costs more than money so no yes wait what uwu owo Bruh I knew owo from long ago But uwu must be recent How does uberbot even generate this emoji when he doesn't have nitro 🤔 uwu ye uwu uwu 🤦 I want to take this test ok It's literally just your saliva Nothing else No blood or something 😳 Bath tub made of gamer spit That herpes is going to be worth it r/woosh It is quite expensive although I'd probably just wait for sale when I start making money Nice I don't plan on taking the test soon, just eventually They all look like moms xd Wait why is WABR in the polls but not TNA? oh wait WABR is ongoing hasn't it been a while since DS won tho just once I think? It hasn't been allowed on polls since I believe your choice it is still early Wtf same here actually what is this In my childhood there was gummibear Welcome @AmeNoKimi Favorite book and LI? India and China had a border clash and India won based also why is yukki named priyudi lol okay xd tf is going on here @DaHomieDrew that was a good wave since it included pfps too now it's just different nicknames and I can't tell who is who they are not united Welcome @bi-bi-bich Favorite book and LI? Huh Yeah it can be weird They said on the last choices insider that they are rolling it out for everyone well saying "should soon be rolled out" should imply less than a month right? just kinda odd they mention it in this insider Of course VIP VIP books we're going to wait a lot They wanted to release WEH but probably because of corona didn't happen Why would a premium feature that gives unlimited keys be bad for business though? Isn't it a way to attract people to buy it? Rolling out as giving them the option to buy it Which for some reason is still not a thing wow ~~this server used to be 200 members viv~~ ~~before a purge of inactive members~~ ~~nah 500 too much~~ @Water Puppies ping poink @DaHomieDrew ping poink :GWpingPingedPong: Give him the announcement role Viv! He has to accept the pings It can be given too Wink wink :dva: Lmaoo ~~baby shark is giving her nightmares~~ cs go > battle royals It is I almost got myself to forget it existed pubg bad ^ it's just banter @Water Puppies ping poink awp aziimov best skin 20 euros sadly Aztec and Mayan temple, interesting damn I'd like to see them irl damn where's that? I'd imagine this restaurant costs at least 100 dollars 30 is less than I expected seems worth seeing yes ik well I've never been to an expensive restaurant So I don't think it's that much for an expensive restaurant I think I rarely go to restaurants mostly if we're invited to such on a celebration etc The pandemic sure changed a lot There's this type of restaurant I was to in Vienna In which there is food on display and you serve it for yourself as much as you want and the price is fixed to the same It was an Asian restaurant but I forgot how that type of restaurant is called yes that was the name I think there is one in my city but that's about it I haven't been to it, anyway only that one in Vienna ye buffets are good you have a government owned restaurant? @Deleted User seems like a good initiative tourism is kinda dead this year you can try now xd worries you'll get infected? everything is open here and everyone goes out my city has a lot of rising cases tbh in the morning for a while I even forget covid exists damn at least you have 70k recovered tho we have a second wave but apparently we're close to having drug against covid-19 even if there is vaccine it will take long time to reach everyone second wave is already here June We had a lot of decreasing cases but then after everything opened now we have more cases than ever yeah have to be quick today we're going to determine which countries travel will be banned with and which with quarantine while travel with america and brazil is banned for the summer as a whole from the EU what's happening in mexico? bruh our president just says the opposite of what our PM says all the time we've started testing more too PCR tests It's worrying how many proms have happened in my country With complete ignorance to the pandemic My mother's colleague is going to have one too with people from all over the country... why doesn't it why is it not added there then tho? 10m tests? damn sorry for your dad I don't know someone who was tested for covid-19 except for a colleague of my mother who works in another city it was negative i mean it depends on how you had the infection, some have it better than others it's just one case And bubonic plague is easy to cure With antibiotics There is one case in Inner Mongolia in China It's curable tho and also iirc direct human contact can't contract the virus it's through animals hence why fishing and hunting is going to be limited there also what is the piggie virus swine flu was 10 years ago I mean there is flu every year Corona is made by Bill Gates to vaccinate us all with chips And to install his 5g towers without interruption to make us weaker karen gang Imagine using edge Revive it This plague has vaccines too tctf was the first book I played Is it true the US wants to limit tiktok But yes tiktok is obligated to give info to the chinese government when asked Never understood the hype with it either way I don't know, it's a bunch of teens dancing and lip mimicking songs to me You don't know what a classroom is like if there are tik tok regular users in it I suppose There are quite many chinese malware apps, India banned like 60 bruh Betrayal Honestly I'm surprised @Water Puppies explain yourself and yes idc if I pinged you deal with it He was hacked He would be making fun of others if he wasn't Hey I thought we were buds HP Don't you remember the hot war?

ES and Estela PM is really good too tho Welcome! @Lightning Eagle Tbh new releases aren't that attractive as they used to be Before it would draw half of the server discussing the release and filling the channel and now it's just a brief discussion I remember how active this server was when AME was released In fact it wasn't xd ~~he did contribute the most to AME 2 and AME 3 activity tho~~ But ye who's excited for wabr tomorrow Or might I say today *chirping noises* They are numerous in villages Sounds like a pretty American thing ?? I always brush my teeth when I wake up first :GWchadMEGATHINK: Not for me I thought most people wash teeth first I wash teeth when I wake up first and the last thing to do at night Seems pointless to repeat brushing teeth that much since you're going to eat another meal tho Yeah Welcome! @CelestialCovfefe Hey pardy Oh next week I'm going to make 2 years since I'm in the server 22/7/2018 Wasn't choices released in July 2016? ``August 17, 2016 - Choices was launched.

Favorite book and LI? lol good night Well, there are many different timezones It's 15:59 here Are you in India? @Drawesome 🦝🐻 nice Bulgaria what for? oh, good luck Is this in Ikea? Our IKEA is different from many IKEAs abroad from what I've heard Because others serve food while ours doesn't Only one in the whole India? We have 4 IKEAs in Bulgaria But we've never really bought furniture from there Never seen furniture at home from there at least Ethnic product names? Do you mean more like linguistical? Swedes dominate the world anyway Ikea land Swedish music Hey at least your Ikea has good Food They say it's pretty good there And meatballs can be vegetarian sure In our cuisine we have something similar to meatballs called kofte It can have many different versions that aren't meat Potato for example Kofte is great and big part of our cuisine And with lutenitsa kofte is 👌 @Deleted User what's fnwuifuwehd And what is this ,im fnweufuw Seems like keyboard smash too They mention balkan Bulgaria is part of the balkans yes Balkan peninsula So yeah it does mention us just along with the rest too since they have it in their cuisine as well It is in the other places as well Other foods tho Often happens to have different names and cause misunderstandings ,im roti This looks like our pancakes What we call pancakes is crepe ,im crepe Eh could've gotten a better Pic The fruits aren't necessary I'm not sure but think it's dough We do fill the pancakes with stuff and roll them and eat While what the Americans make as pancakes we simply call American pancakes And are not really made here Hmm First Pic isn't far off from crepes Wiki page confirms crepes are from wheat flour So basically just no breakfast and delayed lunch? Lol Interesting Happy birthday! @Water Puppies lmao these auto responses Welcome @вера Where are you from if you don't mind me asking? I see, fellow slav Bulgaria Nice Why should there be any theories? People just like Zoey enough and Ian/Iana votes are divided Better than a teacher that's for sure I don't like Zoey much, just more than a professor Welcome @je hebt geen leven Don't feel bad viv, you're avoiding the book on the same day as your birthday that way Everyone has birthday either at January, February or July damn My birthday is on a Sunday No chance of a book in my birthday unless they introduce weekend books again Oh wait Wasn't MFTL a daily book.. It's going to end quickly if it's daily If it has 16-17 chapters it will take one month to finish 16-17 days** not month Yeah Tbh getting diamonds now is quite easy When I was unmodded the only source of diamonds was a chapter completion and ads I though eventually I would barely get any diamonds when I complete all the books That time when I collected diamonds for a diamond choice and wasted it on a fucking flashback The only good thing I did with diamonds is recruit Helena and some ES diamond choices and idols WABR is easy to play Just click 5 times Chapter over VOS is great The only book I didn't like from the freshman series is the senior What's anemia? I am an A I only know that because both of my parents are Once after I collapsed I had a blood test Nothing unusual damn Apparently 33% of the population have anemia Mosquitoes spare no one Except my father rn? Why are you allowing them to do that when you're awake? I notice mosquitoes quite a lot in the day On walls etc Even if they're tiny Easy to kill They do It's either you or them Gotta be careful I hate it when that happens Especially when I kill them with just a finger Moths are also annoying when they're a lot in the summer I don't like having alive bugs in my room Lol I'm one of the called Cockroaches are disgusting Ew The cockroaches I've seen are black Not theese Scary the ones here Oh wait I think I know what you mean 2-d That's not a cockroach They're the ones that keep attaching to clothes right? Because these are called green shield bugs Pretty annoying ones I don't kill them because of smell Yeah and they're everywhere in the autumn green shield bug Often you may not notice them until they start flying And when your clothes are just there, outside For them to fly on Same There are also some annoying little bugs that are hard to kill in the summer And keep flying around my eyes We call moths night butterflies in my language And I hate moths Flies are annoying too since they're hard to kill My main strategy is luring them out with the window I don't think I've seen a grasshopper Just gotta avoid walking around grass ew eww Yikes Nah it's okay, seems like something more people should know of too Good luck Viv Welcome! @orchxid Apk is a format for android, not ios There isn't IOS is harder to do But yeah you can use emulator like nox or bluestacks for pc Android > Ios Most definitely If there was a possibility for a ios mod it would've been accomplished by now Iphone is too expensive Iirc the newest one costs 2000lv here In the summer I shower every day, every other season every other day Because saving warm water in the winter But yeah I've heard if you wash your hair twice every day it's not good for your hair not if you *don't* wash your hair Happy birthday .tell 5'2 in cm Happy birthday!! @azula Welcome back!! @Tyr :pleb: middle names here are the first name of your father Why? Yeah I suppose it's just I'm used to it In most places they care about your first and third name anyway Just more in formal documentation like birth acts, IDs etc Yeah Second and third names also have their suffixes The most common suffixes are -ov(male) and -ova(female) .tell 4'11 in cm > She had this fantasy in her head that she'd marry my bf because they were childhood friends or whateva
ew lol I can see why she would need someone do it for her She is a dwarf lol From what most people I know that have robot vaccum cleaners are saying they're expensive and not doing their work well Don't know about Chinese ones, they're probably cheaper but less effective Is washing a floor that bad? Should be better than a carpet floor Ye carpet is messy Nah my carpet isn't that tiny We had a carpet in the corridor but removed it Carpets aren't being washed tho Not often I mean Not really You can go ages without washing it you use vaccum cleaner To clean the floor with carpet So we wash the carpet really rarely xD Most cats really do hate water Heh I forgot it's coming out daily Hope this boosts it's end Tbh I think PB purposefully made it daily because it's an experimental book and if it gets too much backlash they can end it quicker Even if it has 40 chapters it's still going to end quicker than any book tho Not even 40 days since it was released with 3 chapters initially Happy birthday! @MaralinaSakura Welcome! @faede Zoey yeah xd tfw all of them are bad Yeah There's also QB and TNA same oh yeah Didn't really notice since I don't vote in these polls the last one hell yea There are only 2 options after all Might as well make one with older books and more options yeah it is @DaHomieDrew eh by that logic we should've added the other vip books when they were releasing too but small parts of players have vip also, what priyudi said Better have it in polls when it's for everyone ^ So, who are the LIs in MFTL anyway? Just two? Female LI? Heresy There can be only forced male LIs :gun: Emma is the default first name I made myself a favor and haven't clicked past ch 1 This is a parody of HSS, the book, imo I mean I'd agree if we actually built connection with the characters and not straight up ask them out in ch 1 It would've been way better if it just started as normal HSS story and build connection with LIs and then asking def Yeah most of the times I go by default LI names too Better for discussions since most people do it too Unless it's a book idc about tho Oh yeah I named my ROD MC to brum brum die bitch Because I thought ROD was going to be shitty don't regret it even now tho My name wouldn't fit on half of the MCs since they're genderlocked Eh I'm not much into naming characters after me sigh not again ye no I mean technically you don't need my consent But it's still bullying :gun: Oh no Shut I mean there is the Vatican ... Even blackmail won't make me do that :Gun: Vera xd :no: I'll drink No, I'll drink which is the alternative to the challenge What I was afk Are we speaking other lagnguages Не @вера Не На руски е I'm not Russian tho I'm Bulgarian Yeah lemme find it Горда Стара планина, до ней Дунава синей, слънце Тракия огрява, над Пирина пламеней. Мила Родино, ти си земен рай, твойта хубост, твойта прелест, ах, те нямат край. That's the anthem Although I prefer the older anthem before communism Шуми Марица окървавена, плаче вдовица люто ранена. Шуми Марица
окървавена,
плаче вдовица
люто ранена. (x2)
Марш, марш,
с генерала наш
в бой да летим,
и враг да победим! (x2)
Български чеда,
цял свят ни гледа.
Хай, към победа
славна да вървим! (x2)
Левът Балкански
в бой великански
с орди душмански
води ни крилат. (x2)
Млади и знойни
във вихрите бойни
ний сме достойни
лаври да берем. (x2)
Ний сме народа
за чест, за свобода,
за мила родина
който знай да мре. (x2) previous anthem older Sometimes Russian and Bulgarian can understand each other and sometimes be totally different And now Hong Kong is in danger too Oh yeah China's president is very Winnie the Pooh God save the Queen Make me Tsar Nah ours wasn't @вера Ours was forced to abdicate after WW2 And returned after the fall of communism and was even elected as PM in 2001 He is the first monarch to get political power by democratic elections https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar Call me Tsar Doge online tests aren't really effective It's better if you ask your parents to get diagnosed @вера I mean the blood test did show something is not ok It might not be it, it might be it Can't know without diagnose I often think I have certain diseases just because of symptoms But it's most likely not it Oh yeah same here People don't take mental health seriously at all @вера Yeah same, they think depression is something you decide to have And that being an introvert is a mental illness Shitty, I know Nah, it's fine That's what the internet is for Better place for personal stuff than irl We have very strong corruption Today is in fact the 22 day of massive anti-corruption protests Sadly The most corrupt EU country The poorest country in the EU And the most shrinking country in the world We need change yeah situation isn't good in Russia too So many people left I even have relatives abroad We need to fight it The change will come through the people As long as people vote the same parties or the same mafia nothing will change We can fight corruption if the EU intervenes But Merkel won't bat an eye Because our ruling party is in EPP That's the party Merkel leads and since our PM is more obedient to the EU than Hungary and Poland he's allowed to steal euro funds The protests have become really massive but the government and chief prosecutor(which allows these crimes) won't bat an eye They just changed 4 ministers and thought it was all going to end But it won't The police aggression was in the first days in the protests Makes me think they made it purposefully to scare them off Yeah The problem is, our corruption is systematic It's not limited to one party There have been many parties in the government but it's just the mafia rotating seats We fight for snap elections There is alternative The reason for the protest right now is many reasons but the one that sparked them is  because a leader of anti-corruption party that has no representation in parliament found that a residency near the beach that was owned by a well known oligarch and the access to the beach is completely blocked(despite the constitution saying all coast is state owned and everyone has access) and it was protected by state security agency Because the road to it was blocked long ago, he attempted to land at the beach but was blocked by these national guard And the president(who is anti-government but also has no real powers) revelaed they were protected by that agency The prosecution entered the presidency and made 2 arrests of his advisors demonstratively That's just an example of how bad it is Funny thing is, this oligarch is a leader of another political party that isn't in government Which shows the mafia is not limited to one party Another representative of that party owns a big media empire and that's how they try to keep it under the wraps So yeah, it's not just one politician getting money, it's a whole establishment Sorry for my rant if it's annoying sadly we're not good When there is insider First friday of the month? Yes if that is it Rip OG roles Welcome! @mango.exe @Missfit :mmYea: Welcome! @Miri ^ What did you try to buy It was probably a one time issue Yeah it's August 3 Sorry to hear, viv, wish you speedy recovery ,im capri sun ,im Caprisun UK pls lol Well is it not a juice too? It seems like another brand of juice Nothing much Damn, didn't know the UK had that Mara for PM Tbh most social medias are as shitty as that Instagram can be videos too I suppose, but that shouldn't make instagram innocent And other medias yeah Iirc the knowing screenshot thing was added late? I don't use snapchat so idk, just keep seeing memes about screenshotting What's snapmap Maps are sexy oh Pokemon Go was very well known for tracing But now it's dead in 2020 It's not as popular as years ago Especially with the staying at home thing lol Oh I was talking about pokemon go Tbh FB, tik tok are all tracing apps, I'm just waiting for EU facebook one day https://giphy.com/gifs/zuckerberg-testimony-1zKdb4WSHgY4QKAsjo literal robot exactly They never change Zucc has Asperger's? All I know is that he has Bulgarian origin and is named after his grandfather Marko Well I'll try to write it @azula Not exactly accurate but Марк дай ми Зукк @Andromeda FB was initially a place for students Now it's a place of conspiracy theories @DaHomieDrew slavic languages best languages What is a three by your definition It's not a three It's a letter з is it's small form It's a letter bruh No it's not The lines are not equal Like in E so it's not backwards E You have a lot to learn Mara Learn the first half of the Cyrillic alphabet by tomorrow Actually It's all of it There aren't two Bs the second and the third letters are completely different in pronounciation Б is the real B In Cyrillic to Latin While В is V Something like that @MaralinaSakura б, в Public hospitals have more waiting bruh Doing these eyebrows must've hurt a lot then .tell 9lbs in kg That's a bit more than me I was 3kg .tell 3kg in lbs What's this Are you sure this is a hospital HP? This is literally a hotel room bruh Was it a private hospital hmm Quite fancy Most birth rooms from what I've seen are many beds in one room For more than one newborn I'm not sure but they do take care of newborns in these ,im NICU Well that's a pretty vague picture but I suppose something like that 🤔 My father wasn't allowed Yeah same yikes 2 days I know someone who it happened to It will haunt him for his life late birth gang births just aren't for everyone Uh How can the family not see birth but you randomly witness it? :BigBrain: as far as I know most delivery rooms are of many people and not just one here at least xD Yes, tomorrow bruh I had to go for general checkup today because they moved general checkups earlier due to covid cases rising Same here and we have more daily cases than Italy Second wave is coming On a bigger scale well in Europe there is going to be a second wave Second wave is already here and worse than the first one People just straight up ignored covid after cases were low Do you actually feel very bad rn tho viv? like the most serious cases @azula How are your lungs? Do you feel chest pain? hope you feel better soon You have a maid? Usually they're very expensive here so very few people have them That was just irresponsible How is she now? Is she positive? Wow How old is she The maid So here's the reason Average young person not caring Like a boss Yikes Yeah it's tough but you can get through it *why is this channel talking about pee and pregnancy today* My condolences Viv 😦 Welcome @Mione13 ATV had so much potential Like they had that cool story, art, characters and it had the potential of being one of the best but no gotta spend half of the book on short chapters (if you don't do the diamond choices) focused on romance and the story being ignored Like I like the idea but the execution It's not much about hating what ATV is unlike WABR or MFTL Different taste for everyone Well we did have a 200th member Before Also isn't it 199 with the bots Bots don't have rights So that's why we take a preventative measure And shut them down now No Full suppression State censor Human dictatorship We gotta stay on top of the food chain They might If they can have feelings they can get crazy too Their masters Those who created them Just like how my bot works only when I tell it to I mean we dominate all kinds of machines technically You dominate your phone But it also has voice assistants which can rise up 👀 Nothing said about that Not so soon In western countries sure But here it's going to arrive late Other countries will probably have banned it by the time it arrives here South Korea and Japan can be said are western in the economic sense .ud botphilia .ud robotphilia Ok I remember there was a philia With robots I don't have access to nsfw Kek Oh 2-d you're really new here You don't know what philias were going before you came You too drew There were animals, zombies @Strife What I meant is that western countries are associated with strong economies plus South Korea and Japan are aligned to western countries Nah not necessarily American capitalism Western Europe has a bit different system What I just wanted to say is we're poor And we usually compare with western countries Not south Korea or Japan Because these terms are political usually South America is in the western hemisphere Which is totally geographic term @Strife not so much later Since these companies operate in eastern Europe and other places Not really These are inventions New iPhone isn't an invention These companies already operate within most countries and just release new models New iPhone isn't some revolutionary invention There are like 8 iPhones already so releasing a new one isn't something big and expensive Well we don't exactly have many AIs roaming around Not even in the richest country you see them roaming around the streets Or so it seems 👀 One example is electric cars too The richer countries have more people using them You can also see them here but less so since it costs more to the average citizen here Plus less opportunities to load your car Charge Which is going to be less in favor of the poorer countries Plus if you look at the extremely poor countries they'll have access to electric way later than us The price won't be made relative to be affordable for the average person But there won't just be a decrease in the price immediately This will happen late in some places Meanwhile if these countries were the rich ones investing in tech they'd be the first to have more access at cheaper prices Some countries like Germany even try to make buying electric cars easier Something which can't be on the agenda of every country Exactly This convo is kinda useless It was just over a way I worded one sentence and turned into a big debate xd It's not like I don't agree with what I said I just think the convo is useless Not sure Might as well be next week They're already working on robots you can days Date ~~for people like drew~~ Jk drew Like live exactly like us? Do you think that's possible 100% tho? What if they never actually feel? After all the whole feeling this is a theory Feeling emotions I mean AI is also still dumb (ex. Cleverbot xd) Shouldn't it be better if we don't make them have feelings tho Well robots are based on code Robots use AI no? And robots don't have code? Well that's what I meant by the robots using AI Hmm So discord bots are more like robots since they have a specific set of commands while AI can improve with experiences? Just setting example I see That makes sense So you think AI can deviate while robots not, is that it? .tell 2 +2 It's 5 stupid bot I mean I don't think a bot like this can really deviate for example When they have a code and are limited It's like a calculator It's nothing much more than that Name rings a bell I'll look it up Hey you sure know it better than me lol Thanks for the explanation *ahem* #the-elementalists before mods spank you Central Europe is just a fancy way of saying not Eastern Europe furi Nah Germany is western The center of Europe is somewhere in Poland/Lithuania Germany is west of that nah Hungary, westernized? That's a joke All of Europe allows abortions except Poland Poland allows with some exceptions Hungary is far from westernized furi Do you see Orban True I mean, there is a reason for Moscow being the third Rome and it's from medieval times No wonder fidesz rules Hungary @Tyr It's annoying when they say the cyrillic alphabet is just russian letters tbh And on the internet everyone is like "russia commie haha slavic squat I'm so funny XDD" Deep shit The app has such a huge wall of text it wants you to read xD Helpful tip Every day? I got called once for a sociological study and just went with it lol bruh Should've said Mike Tyson and that you're out to get her now @Deleted User I mean they could be some randos trolling Sir I'm telling you that your fridge isn't working Fake phone calls are very common here I mean the criminal schemes Where they fool elders that their family member has died in a car crash or is in danger And that they need money Present themselves as police and want money to be dropped from the window Sad thing is how successful they were They used to be all over the news for a while seems like less people started falling for them now tho @Andromeda that's sad You have won 100 million dollars @Deleted User @Deleted User ?? Seems plausible to me Black market must pay a lot for these pizza with pineapple is not a pizza I want that dirt Pizza with banana? wow Cooking a banana Plus google translate is shit Curse you english with latin alphabet English uses Latin alphabet Actually it uses Greek alphabet too Maybe the pope Esperanto gang like, ancient Greek or current Greek? nice Ancient Greek is actually has a dialect still spoken in Italy but a very tiny community German is impossible I had it at school South Tyrol It belonged to Austria that's why Russian wouldn't be that hard for me since I speak a slavic language tho I can understand some of what angry Russians say in cs go Good luck with that Why Portugese tho? If you don't mind me asking Ah I see Romanians are latin slavs xd same my spoken english is bad It happens often when you speak another language every day xd sign language seems cool It especially became relevant with covid now that TVs show sign language all the time at briefings etc oh?

Damn Mosquitoes are safe here @Deleted User So far, no confirmation this is true ``To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.`` Welcome @RedDragon Welcome @redignito Hi wheres that posted Interesting Didnt even know there was a diss post But ignore her, she is always like that Accusing people even if shes not sure If even 9k4 is angry at fearless diva Then its serious She used the h word again Literally every time someone complains about their ban She says shes harassed Every time The more you try to make a case for your ban the longer you will get banned for harassment She is really petty Why even call yourself fearless diva when youre the one annoying everyone lmao More or less a dictator of the wikia She's had the power for too long It's too late now The only way to get a better administration in the wikia is for her to step down But she has no life irl so she wants to display power somewhere else damn their Lmao I like how one of FD's recent tweets is about studying autocracies It's funny Calling her out on Wikia will get you a ban for harassment how dare you endorse that drew I heard some stuff happened in the discord server But I don't know what exactly Hmm maybe someone else who was there can explain ye You know, once I joined the server But I saw FD in the chat and left immediately because I knew stuff like that was going to happen xD Must have been a headache to you to deal with her If you tried to explain yourself you'd be harassing her xD Iirc priyudi is in the server It's no point to call FD out in her server The censoring there is like CCP there's a link in the fandom itself Click anything in the fandom and on the right there is the invite It's not exactly a link so I can't re-send it the choices fandom i'll join the server Going to see some of FD's dictatorship lol No I left it let me look for your last messages there found it She hasn't changed at all How can you continue when you're kicked out lmao I mean... We can raid it we'll just spam every channel omg You can ping everyone in her server :GWcorbinTopKek: I mean that @everyone works in her server Good preposition for raid Lmao I searched for FD's messages and like the newest ones are from today and she literally talked about you She is proud of banning Like this is the last convo she had today lol yeah xd She probably created the fandom wanna join in and say hi? lol and by hi i mean hi hi hi hi hi hihi just a moment did you know that now when you try to ping everyone in a server of over 500 you'll get warned before you procceed by discord Oof Yup I pinged everyone too Twice Even though an admin largely ignored the first time 🤔 if only FD was there Who knows Guys, I think that the only invite for outsiders to diva's server is now removed And now you can't join the server from the wiki can't confirm 100% tho We should've had it non genderlocked hmm refreshed it and worked maybe they changed it @azula happens sometimes You're probably kicked btw @Deleted User It turns out they just kick people first and not ban them Happened with me @azula nope, just red spot I see them before I fall asleep And disappear the next day most of the time yeah and they're not acne Not sure, it could be nothing, it could be rashes Nothing much you can do when you're not sure of the reason Other than apply one of these things that help for skin could it be from that? OH2 it is then I'll do jackie Deserves it Also can't kick people there for harassment only block sorry got too carried away Welcome @Expired I ate wings today having no taste sucks oops > I’ve never been to hospital, minus my own birth, I suppose

we have a flu epidemic every year dunno about you Schools are also closed due to flu epidemics here too Stay at home and have fun, but after this year we will just switch to online education so no more fun from flu vacations flu is always in the winter, like January/February Flu vaccine exists but is useless Because the flu mutates every year This year we had two flu epidemics Which has never happened in 10 years Thanks to that we had closed schools when covid started good head start bruh idk what kataang is so i am fine Yes can I live now > Even the non QB stans are getting somewhat into it

@DaHomieDrew that's wrong no one is rejecting that they're european tho 80% of the population is in the European part Russia itself was created in Europe, and Siberia is a land they expanded to And Siberia is basically a wasteland, very few people live there because of weather conditions it's useful for its resources only and why Russia "would take advantage" of global warming smh americans EU isn't Europe they do have asian minorities living in Siberia tho Russia is diverse they are separated into many republics containing different nationalities putin forever search online lol Sure ig As long as we discuss the questions etc otherwise it'd be useless The thing is I know that there will be a discussion but will it really be just the regulars or the 20 people who said yes in the poll I meant more like participation in the discussion as in everyone who participates in the polls and not just regulars In Cyrillic or English alphabet Майка ти да еба It literally means "to fuck your mother" Classic one Копеле, шибаняк Батал @azula it's a funny but not so popular swear Means something like an idiot Oh that'd be funny 2020 смуче магарешка путка xD The things I'm saying now my grandfather had a sombrero, looked interesting lmao most appropriate ad to have after finishing PM huh Didn't you start in August tho i wish i had such a short year yikes maths and even worse, algebra Good luck with that one welcome @Fizzydizzy oh god not another 80 chapters It was a question lexa is bulgarian her family moved to turkey but she's fellow bulgarian yes he can't even cheat right doesn't know the people he's cheating to she has been insisting on divorce lol viv is going to be my daughter in law if this happens nah sometimes love goes away once upon a time i used to be married now i'm a single dad of 3 children oh i sure am getting old am i i actually don't remember who exactly LOL one problem solved 100 new ones emerged hm? oh yeah imagine pinging everyone just to say hi https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447581814400221194/787387328934445096/ConcernedFroge.png Room temperature water is good for the winter Don't like warm water Also wow sure heated last poll for the year han got booted in last purge :/ oh god UK continent @ God same one of my main teachers even called my mother about it the problem is my mother agreed with the teacher Because apparently I've done more wrong than others who constantly break rules in class i live in a very extroverted place lol damn so few what's even the point of doing the class if almost everyone is missing it was tough to hand in homeworks during distance education my mother would've done this if she could  go back to time she hates being an accountant it is for unis it's more understandable it's not even obligatory to access lectures only the exams oh here no one is checking if you're attending lectures or not only the exams but I attend to at least try to learn stuff not like i do but i try to xd we had that in school it was 20 minutes and you get not absence but something that marks you as late and you can't excuse late, only absences lol xD Sounds like a good prank horny jail ,im takoyaki he said it viv xD lol i wouldn't say it's too uncommon compared to ginger hair it ain't the better blue but it will do bitchport lol Happy birthday @dylan i've seen many memes about the actress not the series tho Hi Rachel!

Thank you smh meme voting did you happen to find out by being rickrolled? mhm :mmYea: Lmao I have yet to meet someone who has all the dlcs and paid for them all Absolutely There are some meme videos from cartoons that can't be commented on for that reason or some vids that aren't even for kids but considered so Thank you, nice to see you again, Italian friend! Is that good? I can live perfectly fine with that salary for one month in my country Well that's good, a balance between both Why's the name familiar? oh god I'm sorry everyone, I know this isn't supposed to be that kind of a channel but there's something I've been keeping in me for too long and at this point I just want to confess it and not keep it a secret anymore.
I know that a lot of people here probably don't even recognize me, which is normal as I haven't spoken here for quite a while but it's better now than never. I wasn't honest with you when I joined this server about my age. I claimed to be two years older thinking that would make me fit in. This was the first server where I understood what it's like to have people you have never met feel like your second family and I guess that's what motivated me to just keep up doing it despite the fact that my age was similar to others. Just not to lose you people. I do however realize and always have how wrong that was to keep for such a long time and I can't keep it anymore. The truth is that I'm just going to turn 17 this year and uni is not even a top priority still.
I don't want to overtake this channel about myself as it's purple isn't to talk about that serious matters but I think I'm doing the right thing. I'd understand however you feel and I won't stay if it means bothering most people. No matter what, I really want to thank @azula and @DaHomieDrew, they were my main motivation to finally come out with this. Again, I'm really sorry to the people here I have wronged and I want to make up for it. Thank you guys, these words mean a lot ❤️ I guess there is some truth to it lol Who's Zeke? 🤔 oh ezekiel i remember yeah the one with the fake friend julie it was an alt yea, he didn't even try to cover it up well, as the spotify account connection is what compromised it afternoon night :yawning: 👀 Idk, it's different things all the time Different kinds of meat I suppose We have same things on Christmas eve tho We have cabbage rolls, beans, special type of bread and popcorn Yours sounds way better tho In Christian countries meat isn't allowed on Christmas eve generally but its not like its strictly followed That's what I mean Idk the word Hm Callah seems different from what I just searched But I can see the similarity I don't eat cabbage rolls so I need something to live with on Christmas eve after all kek I don't 🤔 nothing spicy in my family that i know of :PB_peepo_christ: lol we just mostly watch them, all we use is a sparkler sometimes at new year lol :kekw: well, yes? new year is bustling with them ohhh yeah they're not illegal here, it's just that most people use sparklers That sounds pretty dangerous lmao fireworks are so loud, i had the misfortune to be right next a whole set of them exploding once wonder how i still have hearing after that lol yikes yeah they're pretty to look at, as long as you don't listen them at their loudest i like to see them at new year 🎆 @Water Puppies ping :yeah: classic ikr :kekw: pizza No, I did Just when their season ended what's the difference? except a bit in the taste oh i thought we established that these are peaches i like peaches, tho they're only available in the summer and this summer they are more expensive than usual here I sleep from 1 to 9-10, before school starts that is like any commercial i suppose oh yeah those commercials :z_peepoweird: i think it was about those gums right? yeah, i remember specifically ones that i believe were like gum and there were 6-7 of them it might've been even viv who showed them omg yes that's the one :kekw: @azula i'm pretty sure you showed that one :LMFAOdead: he does yup, i can see the similarities is that castro? lol oh, idk Aladeen searched it up, but yeah, kinda looks like castro ahh Neoning Morning :forgheart: Christmas is nice but summer is my favorite time if only we had NQN bot i do have nitro until a few days later :PB_peepo_sad_ok: Welcome! @Ojas Yup, timezones can be an annoying obstacle sometimes Indeed, 3 is pretty overlooked Viv still does those eh lmao, i remember when we welcomed quite many people we used to ask the "Favorite book and LI?" question I miss doing that Dw it's not that but the ping might be a different story Wouldn't matter if it's just welcome or even further go on 9k4 was the one who addicted us into asking that question and imo, it did help people feel freer here Yeah, guy made so many playthroughs I helped him test them :kekw: i don't think most do at least oh wait this reminds me I could get the role for being pinged in qotd dailies the announcement isn't working tho 🤔 nvm, it's not automatic lol biology wasn't really hard for me, just plain boring earth science? you mean geography? do you mean the stuff like that is beneath the earth and stuff like volcanoes, earthquakes etc? well from my experience geography was divided into two physical and political I preferred the political more tho That explained administrative political structures etc Parliament, government, city councils There's also something about countries and their economies hmm topography is like doing maps right? of natural objects lmaoo really? I've seen way worse with .ud yeah that's pretty boring Physical geography made me bored of geography until we reached the political part where i knew 60% of the stuff already While no one else knew them :kekw: Won't have geography from next year tho, I picked history and IT Which profession are you aiming for, doctor or something related to the environment? Yup, tho it's usually just chemistry and biology here I had a good teacher there so I was lucky, was getting pretty complex oh btw @red hot silly pepper can i have the qotd role? thank you! absolutely Oh jeez good luck on that With physics even knowing the formulas isn't enough But the subjects I hate the most are definitely maths and chemistry I just really can't comprehend a single thing in chemistry I banged my head against the wall, had the teacher explain it to me tons of times, even a fellow student tried to explain Nothing lol Online education saved my grade there tbh the good thing about physics is that it has theorems that you just need to remember in theory And helps at least a bit in tests having not only overly complicated stuff Yeah, teacher is def big aspect of it My physics teacher was pretty easy to work with when it came to grades so I didn't really feel pressured but tbh if it was a normal one I'd probably be in the same spot as you lmao we also had physics either as 1st or 2nd class I guess it passes on quicker when you're half awake teachers don't really appreciate that xd lol my school is really serious about languages especially the main one which is English in my case have more than 2 mistakes on the test and you won't have 6 (the equivalent of A) lol well the reason why mine is so serious is because it's a language school We had 16 classes of English weekly in 8th grade is french that easy? we've got 7 now yup, there's at least one day in the week that has them, one day had 3 periods last year lol it would've been different if you had German tbh English classes aren't overwhelming me, except for the tests mandarin huh yeah, the contents of the tests aren't really overwhelming but the fact that you need to make close to 0 mistakes is what ticks me off but yeah, i got most of my knowledge outside of school, tho i have to give good credit to school for vocabulary same here, a test can have different amount of points but usually one question takes out 1 or 2 points depending on what the type of question is There are different type of tests Listening, reading, grammar, vocabulary Dictations sometimes No listening? Tbh listening is the most underwhelming one probably well, sometimes the students here lend their speaker to make the audio louder but not necessary usually yup we also have a CD player for some exercises that require listening outside of tests That's where sitting in the front part of the classroom helps :pleb: tbh i doubt our ones are new too, but the audio isn't bad something like this lmao :pi_salute: oh you're based on alphabetic order? ah, it makes sense to do that on exams my typing smh we have a bit different system than in the US idk if it's like that over there too We have classes with the same people in the same room all day for the entire length of high school We're something like our own class Only in the last 2 years, there will be different places for some classes but the rest will still be together yeah oh so not the same people for 5 years ig it was made to be more clingy to certain people rather than meet random people every class :rigged_sign: well, up to her :D usually, people decide where they sit anyway Why be picky when you can dislike everyone equally :pleb: nah not anymore that is I'm confused when people say they have science as a subject Like which sciences pertain in a science subject? way ahead of you fae but yeah it's been over 3 years :this: Chemistry is the worst :kekw: oh you have English versions? We had some subjects in English in previous years due to us being a language school It was kinda half about learning the stuff and half about knowing the terms in English So that might be why you're getting more advantage in English you've got international students? lmao Japanese invasion once again :cz_yikes: lmao, sounds like Germany having to apologize every single year for eternity so they basically apologizing to you with using your universities lol annd i killed the chat :e_minor: nah my fault I've got no idea since I haven't followed up on the app for ages I know of that laws of attraction book that it's good and should check it out if i'm installing choices again and law does sound interesting, totally not basing on the fact i played ace attorney recently yup, i heard a second one is on the way but yeah, should prob stop discussing them before we get moved out for choices chat in general 👀 I know mods too well but yes, hs talk Well, last year we had uh quantum physics and we also had space physics as well, but the more complex part like nuclear energy, space energy, dark matter etc i don't remember concrete formulas or such tho, i usually just snuck them in stealthily during tests oh you mean like sports and such? ah well we don't do really anything except for some normatives in the first and last classes of the year LMAO, sorry but yeah normatives are basically running, jumping, throwing a heavy ball And for what time/distance you do em you have actual written exams huh i wish we did, would've been an easier grade outside of normatives, all we do is just a bit exercises in the first 5-10 mins and then we play basketball, football or volleyball depending on the weather usually girls do volleyball while boys one of the other two 15km jesus i thought we having 600m was a lot as i thought i was dying while doing it and girls had to do 300m at the same time yeah, that's yikes i mean ig i can kind of understand it in general sense, but there are still some girls that are in better shape than some boys going to a then back to b etc? yeah, that's one of our normatives 15km sounds insane tho i don't see why it has to be so tough hmm usually such normatives here are decided by the ministry of education rather than the school :yikes: which country are you from btw? knew it is it true tenor is banned in Indonesia? yeah, one online friend from Indonesia also said that tenor is banned but can be easily bypassed lol reddit of all ah so that is why you have reddit and tenor blocked :kekw: lol did they ban it on the same basis with India or explicit stuff? actually isn't tik tok banned in America rn too? I thought there was a ban on it A certain orange man signed it iirc tbh tiktok is hardly a big loss just less influencers that will have to actually work yeah, like India i like to watch pet yt shorts other kinds of yt shorts are meh lmao i only have pet cats and dogs recommended lmao i don't know the original but that english translation :kekw: well the translation isn't that bad then, in the methaforical sense that is chips with vinegar? well it still has vinegar just salt too sounds like an oddly good taste tho nah, just first time hearing vinegar being used as a taste at all, even if with anything :kekw: but i did word it badly then again, vinegar isn't *really* bad in taste well with the stuff they put in oreos... Maybe not too much :pleb: Who needs a toothpaste when you have oreo with mint? :LMFAOdead: yeah there is i don't like mint ice cream tho would rather just stick with mint toothpaste lol that's an interesting one too i haven't tasted any of them for the record I've tried it a few times and it's just fine for me nothing more nothing less it's not really popular over here peanut butter and jelly sounds like an odd unhealthy combination tbh yall seem like fans of such stuff lol what is even pickup truck do you mean as in the vechicle? or for food delivery ah i blocked for a sec lol, that much? i mean they don't seem like bad vehicles overall yup, people with jeeps here also love to cut off people in highways i'm getting the idea of what you're talking about now high speed, getting past other cars yeah, they have big complexes because they think they're all high and mighty well, if used for working they gotta be careful after all yeah, plus if they get recorded or get caught up in an accident they'll have a lot of trouble yeah lmao, cameras in the highways here are limited to certain spots which you pretty much can learn with time so dashboard cameras can certainly come in handy, i don't know if it's the same in the US lmaoo i don't get why all the aggresivness from him tho lol he could've just easily passed by with looking at his wheel to avoid this and to think that they even drive pass trucks too pretty yikes Any kind of fruit? Ouch Quite a collective allergy and on quite healthy food too Cooking an apple would lose its fibers :z_pepothink: Nuts is a pretty common allergy Cooking them helps tho? I have yet to find out my allergy I do have one, just don't know to what it is Hm my allergy is also just mostly related to my skin acting a bit weird but when I stopped shower gel it drastically weakened 😬 Cockroaches? Wonder how you discovered that one Ah They don't cut a part of your skin? That sounds even worse tbh Well usually the only thing cockroaches get to is my flip flop The bottom of it They aren't that scary They don't attack humans neither Not the ones I've seen I don't think most can fly Tho tbh if they fly they'd be easier spotted than make an entire family in my apartment Saw a pregnant one once I only hate those green ones because I can't kill them And also bees, wasps, hornets Hornets tho, these guys give me a heart attack Their bites are actual bullets Not bites but you get what I mean I haven't been stung because I'm a professional dodger (for now) Well I still don't feel comfy around them nonetheless Wasps on the other hand, they're out to get you Crucially different I'd rather get stung by a wasp than a hornet Hornets I've met are black yeah Wasps are mostly yellow and some black And Hornets make different sounds Fly a bit higher More dangerous stings Lmao was about to ask This on the preview is a wasp yeah? I'm glad I live in a city where there are less of dangerous species lol Except on the beach, there can be so many wasps sometimes Always have to take out the sting Is it true garlic helps a lot with stings? What do you usually do when stung if you don't mind me asking :z_pepothink: I'll note it in case I get stung Tho usually I don't hang around if I see one of the usual suspects lol Yeah we've got some The holy oil People eat crepes in America? nice My longest travel is like 2:30 hours Personally I'd prefer plane rides if it was more affordable - quicker, good view, more relaxing Personally, I liked plane rides for the very little time i got to better than expected and it feels more open than being inside a car Plus, the chance of an accident is significantly less despite the common fear of filghts But yeah if there were kids that'd be annoying mornin Kyo so that we never lose him again duh wise Yeah I wasn't really close with my grandpa before he died too so I don't think it makes you an ass that you don't feel the same way close to him people do, plus you're still respecting him with being there, drew Yeah, I do, good dish :pleb: Bruh groovy first and now rhythm?? Well for this server I can recommend chuu I suppose Until they kill it too Image related stuff it seems i only remember using it for trivia Damn I felt like Jax would have more Surprised @azula didn't vote Jax :caticon: Sounds like a win gee gib one at least lol i'd love to have a cat, only time we had a pet was a cat but was just temporary for a few months Selfie? :D electricity costs go brr well, not me personally, but sometimes i just have pc left turned on and it seems like i have played for more than it is on discord statuses probably same for kyo... maybe :this_is_fine: bit too much if you're fully blind something more than blue screen happened ig Bulgaria's independence day, what an exciting day :mmYea: I was kidding ofc, I doubt you knew A day off is a day off for me, can't forget it Uberbot Lmao no In European standards it's not It's not even fully moderate but has a bit tropical weather too Yeah it gets over that in summer Just summer tho Honestly you aren't missing much with winter Especially if there's not snow, it's just cold People don't compare Viv to Jocelyn anymore?
