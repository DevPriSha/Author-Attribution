then in my last year of hs we hosted girls only and it was the chillest ever. they cooked and cleaned for themselves and were quiet and respectful haha i’m sure even if you hosted a boy it would be fine, we had like 4-5 at any given time what country are you guys planning to host from? i don’t remember a single one shdghfjkh
