i'm indian and literally nobody uses t-series 👍 i gotchu Yeah, the origin's from the iconic Jasmine Masters. She said that when she hit her balls on a table and interjected with that phrase. I'm not exactly sure about Jasmine's pronouns (Wikipedia says "he" but the Drag Race wiki says "she") but the phrase gained popularity on gay Twitter and black Twitter. But now it's been overused, mainly because of VSCO girls and other people using it randomly. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm :ethink: v s c o i'll play \**** games wot my four-legged friend is not my valentine lmao uwu uno clue > uno it's the best board game ever. You solve a murder. Who committed the murder, with what weapon, and where OMG you're missing out FUCK MONOPOLY It's called Cluedo outside of North America @Deleted User https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo I have like 2 versions of Monopoly and 5 Clue versions. I like the gimmickiness of the Empire version of Monopoly Chess is good but I lost all the pieces Lol I never met my grandpas Lmao lmao my mom won't play clue because it has murder in it clue + ludo = cluedo hence the north american name @oge Yes. That's literally why the creator of the game named it that. It was originally in the UK, but in the 60s it was imported to the United States as Clue.
