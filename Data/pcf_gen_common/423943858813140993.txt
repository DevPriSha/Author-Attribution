Such as a tv show season ending on a cliffhanger only to be cancelled I actually usually prefer light themes but Discord's is just so blindingly white when ur light theme works better than a flashlight i didn't know until a few days ago LOL i swear my eyes are like genuinely acting wonky now, it doesn't help that on top of how bright discord light theme naturally is I have my brightness on full because I like it lol. Every single device I have is also on full brightness barring any needs to not such as to conserve battery life mid is ok omg I can't noooooo it kills me I don't like this dark theme especially the switch to orange instead of blue ü§Æ it reduces the blue light from the screen, which somehow makes it easier to look at I've never actually used it boomer i hate the darkness reeeee I am not afraid to admit that I am afraid of the dark. Especially if I have to walk in the dark, it's not really about being afraid but I naturally get tense in the dark because of the vision loss. i can sleep with the light on, tv on, etc I once went to sleep with headphones on listening to youtube üò≥ I only watch cable for one show rn because NOTHING is coming on *misinformation
