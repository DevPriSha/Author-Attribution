After introductions, he asks the new neighbor what he does for a living.
The new neighbor says, "I'm a professor." The first neigbhbor then asks, "Oh yeah, what do you teach?"
"Logic," the professor reponds.
"What is that?" the neighbor inquires.
"Well, let me see if I can give you an example...you have a dog, right?"
"Yeah, that's right," neighbor #1 responds.
"And you have children too, right?" says the professor.
"Wow, right again!" exclaims the neighbor.
"So, then you must be married and that would make you a heterosexual, right?'' proclaims the professor.
"Unbelievable, you're absolutely correct. How do you know all this about me?"
"Well," the professor says, "I observed there was a dog house in your backyard, so you must have a dog. I also saw bicycles next to your garage, so you must have children. And if you have children, you are probably married and if your married, you are most likely heterosexual... it was all logical!"
The next afternoon, the neighbor runs into his old friend. His friend asks if he has met the new neighbor. The man says that he met him yesterday.
"What's he like?"
"Well," the man says, "he's nice and he is a professor of logic."
"Oh," says the friend, "what's logic?"
"Maybe I can give you an example. Do you have a dog house?"
"Why, no, I do not," responds the friend.
"Well, then," proclaims the man, "you must be gay!"

Why bioware They just forgot to hire a decent animator for people Nah fam Just make all games a hl2 mod Division 2 comes out in like a week and a half Bruh division is a good game, i would play metro but they moved it to epic store so fuck that i dont care enough to go to shitty platform to buy it Tfw its wednesday not friday Fuk u :tfwn: trebek has cancer :tfwn: Throw it in the oven on low for a bit :GWqlabsFeelsComfyMan: Ride or die rp when We can be the cars kachow :GWqlabsFeelsNinjaMan: stealy whealy automobiley What and why Oof cleric nah i can just read :mmYea: violence oh why so mean to danni i mean real homie questions whyd you make a short thats essentially danni gettin hurt But y tho :tfwn: theres a weekend between me and monday releases Hwat is that No way is the tambourine a pokemon Im shook Wew Its a legendary, literal gods that created the world are on the same level as a ball of mercury Bruh moment The evolution better be 10 feet tall I havent watched pokemon since diamond which was also one of the best pokemon games That might taste made good but if offered to me like no way "I dont like sea food just fish and squid" like sorry for the call out but most sea food is fish, tho i get maybe crustaceans? you dont like

Sushi is my jam. I got like 10 sushi joints around me, one bein all you can eat sushi and i dunno how they make money cause its good sushi This guy over here eatin dolphins 

Sushi mad good Oof I dunt get it Knife to meet u :rainbowbulli: kool Its the drama channel Usually its pretty safe but you can help yourself out by making the exchange in very public areas or near police stations or the like. In some cities in america, local police have set up online exchange areas right by police But in hp theyre murdmermaids No pictures but theres some pretty worthwhile choice of games 
They might cost a few dollars tho depends I kinda wish choices had a user made story function
They probably have enough assets for it Well its not like i want the app to be plastered with garbage but some of the recent books are making me think gimme the assets and a decent creator and i could probably top some of this Well duck me then i want user made stories cause i dont like some of the writing coming from pb so an idea contest then pb writing it doesnt really solve anything Idk maybe but the diamond scene push is kinda ducking books now so i wanna take a bonk stick to pb Play choice of games
No pretty pictures but some emphasis on some of the writing is really good and fun Ive played lost heir a lot
Keeper of the sun and moon came out and was good
I played rebels a few times, idk i probably llayed tournament I've pretty much played all of them except for the ones with like 2 stars on google play I like arcana too but their diamond system is a lil expensive. It also feels like they put negative 5 thought into how much things should cost Theyre are probably cracked versions of cog but i mean they only cost like 3 dollars if you cant find one but wanna play one or i think hosted games have free playthroughs with ads Theres romance in some choice of games
The class system in lost heir is mad good tho and the romance is tolerable No romance and choices dont matter but out there chronicles is a good sci fi game I'm only good at making characters and ideas for rps when it gets to how the story should go and stuff i just go back into the bush Tbf atla has a simple but great world "How'd they get bending powers"
*smokes doobie*
"Big fuckin turtles gave it to em" Korra was alright i admittedly didn't watch all of it but it was good enough Aubrey plazas character was hot id let her ice murder blackmail me into a relationship Yeah Tfw no eskimo gf Im okay with that Idk atla was so good but idk if it needed lok. Like i was fine where the story ended but then they were like what if cars and shit.

This isnt in the players handbook Isnt simlish like danish gibberish or something lol My man https://v.redd.it/fgbk8y8bw6m21 Everyone believes Ant-Man could kill Thanos by shrinking, going up his asshole, and expanding. I thought about this, and I cant think of a worse death.. for Ant-man. Thanos is pretty tough, like can take some punches from the Hulk kind-of-tough, well his butthole and insides have to be hulk-level strong too.

The way I see it happening is Ant-man crawling up his butt, expanding and then whatever I can describe as the chunky human soup that would come flying out of Thanos ass from Ant-man trying to expand into something that just wont budge. Percy jackson was my jam when i was younger watch it in french Watch shield hero or slime anime :monkagun: Mythological story of kaguya is basically sokka and yue Kaguya was a princess who turned into the moon and her lover was left down on earth to wait Reeee no way im going through 160 chapters but theres a really good scene in the kaguya sama manga where theyre stargazing and shinomaya is telling the story of kaguya and he goes on to stay hed never be fine with waiting hed do anything to be reunited with kaguya and kaguya like :GWqlabsHyperSweats: When are all the kids gonna die Heck children Dead kids No one dies No kids in it :bigmood: What Oh Doggie Not much else is happening in bulgaria i guess i had longue hair in hs Light pollution Underage by us standards Most of world is 18 Or 16 someplaces You can drink at home in us at any age too :tfwn: :tfwn: :tfwn: james is leaving cowchop *looks at bloodbound* Hi https://gfycat.com/HighMedicalCoral meee hungryy I liked the art :tfwn: I dont like some of the new art that tries too hard to be realistic and makes the characters uggly Skinny smol tiddy pls No pls Nympho mc when Oh wait Aster is a dryad

then hitler sayd first vienna award puppet is the word at least its how youre considered in hoi4 sorry bubby big lel us and uk both contributed a bunch ww2 i mean soviets lost the most men but mostly cause manpower was their main advantage nah u cant fault the past for that germany had already surrender by time of a bomb he meant atom bomb i mean us basically had two options 
fight long protracted war trying to land on japan killing a mega fuck load
or drop two atomic bombs and have them surrender killing likely significantly less ww2 was hell
i mean nagasaki and hiroshima were bad but firebombing of tokyo was horrendous especially considering no nuke
japan did some reeaaal bad shit too
i think we lucky we cant really have another war like ww2 ever again i mean japan has stayed safe for centuries cause its mad hard to invade their island

You can do your best and thats about it. Its the proper thing to ask someones pronouns ye. If they get offended thats kinda their own fault I mean look you dont have to ask if you dont want to. On the off odds you manage to misgender someone they'll probably just correct you and everyone moves on. Thats what civilized people do #deleted-channel i guess? Or just stop whatever I fold my pizza slices like a taco anyway Folding the pizza like a taco is fun and all the toppings are like taco fillings

I'm kinda big sad telltale went out of business although some of the the games they put out right before they died were the opposite of good
Gotg was?? alright, but the character design was so hideous it hurt
Same for the batman one, i liked the batman one more but by the final episode I'd just lost interest Eh i stopped getting into it after like the second one
The third one wasnt bad it just wasnt as good imo
Haven't played the fourth one Was talking about walking dead Theres a sale or special offer for diamonds if anyone else is legit  I like the less i know the better Band Shit what did i call my The Freshman band
It was pretty good too https://youtu.be/lLjBQQ5YZYk :yob: Yeah french people don't like opt out of tipping its just not a thing culturally. They usually have a service charge or factor it into the prices, not to say they don't like the occasional foreigner throwing some extra euros their way.

Paris is kinda just like any other city. I enjoyed seeing the sights, but i ran into like the same kind of people I'd see in my own city, they just spoke french instead of english. 

Don't let awkward stop you from enjoying your time there, most people are nice. It's funny tho cause there's a thing called Paris Syndrome or something in Japan where tourists get this really big, played up idea of Paris and then they get there and they're like yo wtf this is just another city culture shock time I mean sad history time America basically did tipping so they wouldn't have to pay minorities back in the day I mean don't assume everyone in france speaks english but your waitress/tour guide/museum staff/hotel person won't mind if you try english first Worst case scene just start gesturing Jab at the menu
Non speak franch Nibba thats ww2 I mean you gotta know what ww2 is
Nah history aint useless Unless you're a hardboiled egg Dropped on the pavement History is mad cool Nah there were countries with slavery long after america abolished it, we were just one of the few to fight a civil war over it

85 questions is what we had down here in our standardized stuff in ga Multiple choice :GWqlabsThisIsFine: AP is wack tho what u wanna do is find like a nearby community college and dual enroll and just take courses there cause it doesn't all come down to one test and its usually easier imo plus if ny is like ga, the state pays for it Yeah buts aps are shit
They're usually harder than actual college course
Everything comes down to one test at the end for credit
Takes two semesters instead of one
If you play your cards right i mean i was only at hs for an hour or 2 a day by senior year You have to pass exam for credit
You can take college courses that count for hs online
Idk about gpa in ny

Idk it made thinga easier for me but idk what ever you wanna do im sure theres an argument for ap I got a 3 on calc and theyre like u dun fucked up son u wasted a year now for no college credit so i had to retake calc in college Heh No one cares where you go for undergrad tbh so i mean you can flex and try and get into an ivy league or just go somewhere you want, with like nice opportunities for what you wanna do

I kinda like pools mostly cause if i get water in my mouth its not salty and full of fish pee, also they're comfy especially if they're heated
Sole exception is hot springs in iceland which were the bomb but dont get ur hair in the water lel Pool water tastes better imo if i get some in my mouth im not gulping it down I like looking in lakes but then i step in one and i cant see through it and i get lake mud on my feet i freak out Modded game: *deletes saves* *dabs* All of you are weird

more obscure but strange days at blake holsey high im gettin mad nostalgia how do i go back too early for me
my sister watched alot of it 19, 20 in june jonas bros are doing a concert or something i saw an ad for it i try to go like first or second cause its easier to present when the bar hasnt been set too high yet lol if that were an option haha the best is when the smort kids take too long and they got to move presentations to tomorrow so u get another night to fix your hot mess of a project more than one would think i took engineering (woodshop) in high school and one of my big end of the year projects was this gaming table i was making with a buddy of mine, we had like two months to do it so being smart cookies we didnt even start til the last week, it was pretty sweet, nice sturdy table, stained and laquered, computer monitor in the middle for displaying maps and shit, phone charging ports, halfway decent cover on the table proper, the problem was we took so long so being responsible seniors we skipped two days of hs including our set presentation day to finish it and the teacher was like fuckin smh alright present it on friday that was a wack class surprisingly enough my social anxiety didnt care about that in the moment
by senior year you get used to it tho tbh cause they make you present like 3 times a month eh thats why group ones are good cause u got some homies to take the spotlight off you and you only gotta read like two slides and then say the end Sad Helo Uhh Oh yeah for hs Colleges love that calc
Its not so bad honestly just gotta do alot of practice Why tf college have pe Gimme like 30 minutes to remember calc and google i could solve that I basically took calc a year ago and then im lile bye bye knowledge What majors need stat cause all the sciencey stuff wants calc Integration is calc Im probbably switching my major to game design cause im a hard boiled egg that likes making my life hard but i think i might actually enjoy it Wew Tfw u wanna make the next witcher 3 but publishers want you to make fortnite 2 for iOS Abby normal We need less ame 
To be honest Hmm Bost it
If u wan "So why is there a choices and a general" Yup Its a round about discussion
Mostly because people dont wanna talk about general stuff in choices chat so they made general but now that theres two channels mods dont really want choices stuff in general
Tbh i tut a little when people get too finicky but its the mods perogative Eh
It works and mods dont really tell people to move out of general unless it starts getting spoilery or going into a big book discussion Heres where the roundabout comes in
Its like you can get weed in small amounts in Amsterdam coffee shops even tho thats technically illegal still there What does that mean No I don't get it I don't think so hmm? nice Ive done what i think is an interactive murder mystery once and basically audience members got identities and like clues and worked with the hosts/cast to solve the murder well its more like "we've found this cipher" and then peeps work together to solve it Who tf doesnt like persona 4 I wanna cuddle yukiko I wanted and still want to murder the big bear thing Nah yosuke has some serious scenes but teddie can go flub himself P5 tho

Cool i feel old now  Do you play on android or iphone? 10,000 upscapes and we become a storyscape server :pepohmm: do they have more than a demo on iphone? Uh don't quote me but probably have to wait til more early access spots open or the app releases I thought these were supposed to be fun My personality was error
The quiz told me i answered the questions wrong "You agreed too many times and we can't pick a personality to give you or you have many personalities at once" in the basic words of the quiz Here's some bar graphs that don't mean much unless you buy their book Sadly no I prefer the ones where its like do u wanna read a book or do you wanna do sport I like theses ones 
https://www.visualdna.com/quizzes/ https://quizzes.clickhole.com/which-one-of-the-kids-who-i-sell-samurai-swords-to-are-1825124981 Nice I think Oof i understand what doge is saying but I don't agree with it. The point i think they're trying to make is that regardless of what the law says, a teenager is not developed enough to understand the consequences of sex, even with other teenagers. Like I said, I don't really agree with this I think you could argue more on the basis of education. When I was 16-18, I knew that unprotected sex could de_stroy your life, children, stds, etc. and that there were healthy ways to prevent these things, but that's because I received sex ed at some point while in less developed regions and areas with rather conservative point of views that don't have access or choose not to provide education about this, you could raise the point that two teens can't really "consent" when they barely know what they're doing. Anyway, thanks for coming to my ted talk That sounds like a fair bit of work just to accomplish taking notes faster but I'm a pretty bad student lel Poll Lel haven't touched moty but sounds like eiko is popular Nobody loves levi i guess Future server icon to reflect my own :yob: the poll will decide Oof Eiko won  oof i thought i'd use the promo pic pb released Poke moms Welcom  Thought I'd try some storyscapes

I enjoy the universe itself more than the original movies tbh. The kotor games were my real jam It's not everyones cup of tea but ive got like 400 hours in swtor. The base game story is great GOOD game  Yes

Pretty good and big sad Shore Same
Honestly while the arcana had great art the gameplay was very meh. I still haven't finished any of the routes. Obviously yeah but the decisions were mostly meaningless and the diamond scenes varied in quality and iirc the costs were kinda random
It was more like a visual novel than interactive fiction imo Ah well, mighta just been me If they don't show up in 10 minutes legally we're allowed to leave Mendes City skylines? :PeepoEh: 
I wish simcity was the simcity we all wanted Honestly I've tried it and yeah the learning curve is definitely high but from the other paradox strategy games I've played i think the only way is through and once you get over the curve it's gonna seem really easy. I'm just not there yet haha

Don't play chile or something but Hungary or even germany are good starters

Vic2 isn't that bad once you get the hang of it and its way better with friends

Ck2, your ruler can fall down some stairs and its game over goodbye 5 hours of gameplay Italy is a good starter country if you don't wanna play germany. Just gotta keep those ports garrisoned and trudge through africa Its easy beasy, ussr can steamroll ai germany just gotta deal with naval invading allies Go through canada honestly Hoi4 has the best mods too tbh
Kaiserreich is great
Old world blues is an omega good fallout mod Yes germany won ww1 and lore lore lore theres dirty communists everywhere

Bulgaria is stronk Ottomans are still there Ottomans have a revolt from middle eastern puppets but unless one of the puppets is a player they usually lose Its basically
One state is gommunist and in France's sphere
One state is democratic i think and in Austria's sphere
Theres another democratic one in the south thats mostly independent but not the legitimate government 
And the legitimate monarchy has been exiled to sardinia Pope can either be neutralish and be southern states puppet or go paternal autocrats iirc and the pope declares war on the gommunists with the primo focus "kill them all and let god sort them out" Sad

Gosh frittata https://youtu.be/9hhMUT2U2L4 We have different brains I see Not even baby teeth? Weirdo Nah
I mean
Parts of a filling are uncomfortable 
But it shouldn't be painful Cavities are usually noticeable by a sticky spot on the tooth

The dentist numbs your mouth with a topical analgesic
Tastes not so good and if you get it in your saliva it'll numb the back of your throat which feels weird 
Then they inject a stronger anesthetic into the mouth to numb the area where they'll be drilling.
They drill out the cavity removing decay
Add a bit of medicine to prevent decay
Fill the cavity with magic tooth stuff
Blast the magic tooth stuff with uv to set it
Then they file it down to match the corresponding upper or lower tooth
Avoid leaving any sharp edges
And then you go home with a numb mouth and filled cavity ready to continue not taking care of your teeth They use like tooth clay
I get the tooth colored because the silver fillings are unappealing Nah What People like dimples https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OA0asXeUgsU jealousy, jealousy is good water u studying same
had it as my major for a while
but i uh
stopped attempted to swap
college messed up some paperwork
kinda gave up after that so vaguely dropped out
still debating going back
this is not an encouraging story
doing better now tho so that's good well
idk how it works at your college
but i basically stopped taking classes and eventually they told me if I wanted to continue I had to reapply to the college and that was significantly too much effort for me at the time to graduate?
just pass the classes
classwork, some tests, and a final + midterm exam depends on the class
usually just a cumulative review of everything we covered over the semester
some classes had a larger written portion
some classes had mostly multiple choice flight attending is supposed to be a good job
at least in the us get yonked out the plane for some computer jobs now adays too
companies like google/microsoft offer certification that can help your resume

probably the easiest too are you still mormon because i was about to start roasting mormons in the general chat what pog
besides all the other things wrong with the church of mormon
my favorite bit is the story of how Joseph smith stuck his head in a lead box and got the golden tablets from the angels that form the basis of mormonism
so he goes to a printer and transcribes the entirety of the tablets by sticking his head in the lead box but the printer's wife is sus as hell so she tells the printer to hide the transcription and tell joseph smith that it was destroyed

so the printer does this and tells joseph smith that they have to re transcribe the entire thing and joseph smith goes uhhhhhh the angels are angry and now i can't access the tablets anymore

and the mormons are like sounds reasonable to me

story poorly told by south park and then poorly remembered by me Mormons are in a cult Do ur family come from Utah
I heard Utah is Mormon country Uh
Might be an Asia catholic thing cause I've never heard of this oof I was raised catholic but I stopped going to church pretty early on Stopped when I started high school

It was two blue pills and they took me in
I was conscious while they did the  big needle to numb my mouth and I was making conversation with the dentist and I blinked and was like "when are you gonna take the tooth out" and they're like "we're done" I had one wisdom tooth that actually erupted and was causing a problem but the other ones are still in

It was like 8,000 dollars to remove all of them or like 2,000 to remove just the one so we went with that option I may be overpricing it by a few thousand but it was deffo way more expensive to get them all out

I saw hamilton a month or so ago but I bought the tickets sometime in 2019 lol cause covid Normally no
Would be the second concert I've been to basically ever
But it do be Mitski
The whole tours sold out lmao I am a fool and I bought a ticket
Looking at the tour list and seeing the wall of sold out erased my idea of waiting for cheaper tickets I know True Europe has it rough
Although
If you consider travel time one stop per some states is basically one stop per country in europe I don't go out often so not too bad
Its not gonna break the bank for me as long as I don't go crazy for a while Do you have to be happy to order the happy meal Cut holes in bedsheet, become spooky ghost  
Buy cheap pair of scrubs, become nurse  
Cowboy hat and jeans = cowboy 
Bow tie + button up with pens in the frocket + big glasses = nerd  I think there's a uniform store where you could possibly get a pair of scrubs for 20 dollars which is cheapish
Easiest if you already have them Depends on if you like a physical book feeling or not
Kindle is linked with Amazon so if you have prime you can get some advantages plus Kindle Unlimited
I think Nook is cheaper and the paperwhites simulate pages better

I had a kindle fire years ago and it was ok

If you already have a tablet or smartphone you can just get the kindle app and use it to read ebooks if you're apprehensive about getting a dedicated device This is how I pass history tests

Well B was 2 pages in the textbook before A therefore... But the french revolution was before Napoleon Looks 19 but is secretly 50 Dude I'd like to friend Ough

Nearly moved to Portugal right before covid started
Never actually been to Portugal but their citizenship by investment program is so good we almost moved just to take advantage of it My Indian history is very bad, I only know like British Raj, Mughal Empire, Deccan Princes Although diamonds aren't objectively valuable, the price is just massively inflated tbf we've been stealing from each other as a species since we were cavemen Persia and the Mughals maybe Were they islamic before spain? I know Indonesia was islamic around then Hindu and Islamic
Started changing to Islamic around 1400-1600 afaik Islam had spread pretty far by the time Europeans started colonizing Kinda, the prevaling theory is we all descended from a common ancestor in Africa but some new theories are that we evolved in many different places I am hella white sadge

Warm tea helps sometimes Might be strep throat or something Hopefully you're pretty covid immune since you had it once already https://youtu.be/3eDPWsRZfEg oof Math?

and possibly a masters
still deciding having to retake german cause adhd + courseload made me crash and burn the first time
others should be good though the language isn't so bad actually

i just need to get my foreign language requirements for my major out of the way so i can never speak german again Germany is a good place to live
Living there might be neat but immigrating anywhere can be quite difficult and expensive Who are you teaching I could probably tell if someone is a teenager vs in their twenties but anything more specific than that no way Does it taste like candy Whats the flavor called Nice Intriguing Ah

Gonna pass

Good luck And this requires you to catfish someone I don't really like my image being out there that much

I might have also done pre school
