Hello there! And my favorite book is BOLAS and favorite Li Aiden. Yeah, tho I spended like 20 diamonds only in BOLAS. Lol I was trying to get most amount of points without spending a single diamond but it's difficult not to spend a single diamonds. > i spent half of my surplus xd
@DaHomieDrew many did that lol. Same. Pb has made a good book after so many days. Like, I really enjoyed the book but it kind of sucks seeing both Witness and Bolas getting 2nd book. Thank you! > @Drawesome 🦝🐻 right? this heteronormative genderlocked smut needs to end
@DaHomieDrew totally agreed. I think this book doesn't deserve 2nd book and pahh why is it getting so many chapters? Meh, I dislike this book and don't mind me and some people call it wetness 🤣 It is. And the diamond system sucks in wetness. Not to mention the bratty MC. Exactly! You know, once a user called Wetness trashy and some users got triggered cuz they like the book. Weird liking.... Loll they surely do Can't blame them. 
What do you hate the most about wetness? Actually there is something good. Diamonds we get at end of the chapter I kind of feel bad that good outfits and hairstyles were wasted here. > they're so beautiful but the MC wants to hook up on every square inch 🤡
@DaHomieDrew she does. Like she gets turned on from everything. Wtf? Hii there @azula I am fine. How are you? And yeah, Asian squad tho I didn't knew so many played choices. I am a South Asian! Yeah😅 They just forget and assume all are east Asians Yep. And they forget other countries exist 🤣 Tho I can't blame them, Asia is mostly looked by that aspect. That is Chinese and  Japanese. I want a pet but my parents say
