Ooh Wow it’s basically Choices’ twin Or sister game to say the least How do they compare? Or are they just about the same? uff I tried it a little. Some of the facial expressions on the characters are a bit cringy but it’s kinda good like from the days of EA? when some of PB's workers worked there? i miss it too. iconic story i remember was The Maskmaker, that was some sad and creepy shit damn its nearly 50-50 between Frank and Courtney XD its funny, this server has a lot of people yet the majority of them are not that active and only 10 votes still and i only ever see you guys' names in these channels aww Banana Guy shouldve been added :/ smh with an ego like that, rip i better hope its playful banter bc y'all sound like you're ready to climb out of each other's screens and bitch slap one another XD lol At least we don’t have it bad like the Choices people on Tumblr do.

Ooh! wow ehhhh idk, doesnt sound like my type of thing nothing says amazing like a creepy ass happy face 😄 Have fun here in SoCal! Apologies for the damn heat. It really be like that If y’all understand Fahrenheit, it’s triple digits currently like 106 degrees It’s basically hotter than the devil’s ass this time of the year Yeah that ^ True I hate sticky weather Freezing rain is hella better I’d rather be freezing than melting Rip Kyo It really be like that sometimes Cold > hot Oh yeah, Dorian is being a real bitch I still prefer hoodie weather all the way Hot weather, I always go with a simple t-shirt and long pants because I’m very insecure of my upper arms and legs but cold weather, it’s perfect because I basically hide behind several layers ^ You can still contract stuff in hot weather like seasonal allergies Those are a bitch in warm weather I’m prone to allergies no matter the time of year, thanks to my dad’s genetics yup im okay with that bc i dont want anything getting inside my house. hot is when a bunch of flies ambush me at the front door so then they invade my fricken house cold gives me an excuse to stay indoors and just binge-watch something or play PC games thats called a screen actually window screen more like indoors is where there's no people and social interactions, apart from my dog and family which i tolerate c: oof lol i thought we were done with those XD IMUSA why? a brand of cookware i dont think its new imo, my family has had the IMUSA rice cooker for a while now ah ok well this is an interesting turn of events Glory to Arstotzka shouldve gone into #memes tho XD but i love it!! FOR KOLECHIA she's traveling @Deleted User same here lol wish the relationship got more screen time before you-know-what happened Winston and Monty i imagine there might've been a potential redemption arc but after all he's done, i doubt it deadass i skimmed those two episodes just to find those scenes yeah xd yeah and yet Winston defended him anyway because of their two encounters so now im torn the actor tho, Timothy Granaderos is so nice and hot af he doesnt even look like he's in his early 30s and can still pass off as a high school teen Agreed @literal legend. Honestly it seems like there’s no genuine protagonists in that show anymore imo but I might be wrong Hola newcomer Like okay, they’re lucky that I grew up with no interest in hip hop/rap crap, I stayed away from smoking and vaping and drinking, I have no interest in getting tattoos, etc etc. but the least they can do is get off my case when it comes to school and such Vietnam Not to mention the LGBT topic Well I didn’t, thank God I find it repulsive Like I wanna die early sometimes but I’m not gonna do it THAT way I love them and everything but they can be very suffocating My parents have their ups and downs They’re the reason I have personal problems and then they tell me to keep it to myself like who tf can I talk to about this shit because it certainly can’t be you two Like I have to tell SOMEONE They still don’t grasp the concept of venting And now I’m having headaches because we’re discussing gender choices on a game 🙃 yeah even i moved on from it XD For those of you also part of the Choices Facebook discussion group: what are your honest thoughts about this? Ehh now I’m feeling too lazy to repost the screenshot XD I’m currently in a US History class rn and I kinda feel like our professor has been putting off the actual U.S. part off Yeah we’re at least slightly more progressive compared to Russia XD Uh huh Oof You two should get a room Damn got there first before me XD Seconded Okay, go to #thirst-channel like right now Please don’t turn this into 50 Shades of Batshit Craziness Mhm..... XD Rip Aight my professor is about to finally get off her phone. Imma leave any second now Okay ttyl bitches @Raven Ocean Eyes like Owl City’s album or some song called Ocean Eyes? Ah ok Yikes Oh boy music puns now XD rip Because money and jobs and other adulting crap Ok deadass I was bored af so I felt like scrolling up the #roast-pb channel and then while I was scrolling back down, this date pops up time travel, im callin it oh plz, its non-existent get it right wut ... idk what that means xd Vietnam War didn’t need to happen according to some historians but what’s done is done My dad fought on the south’s side. Very anti-communism. Chose to leave the country illegally along with his younger brother on nothing but a small ass rowboat to the Philippines boy did that work out well... ig when you think about it, the communism concept is slowly dying anyhow and Vietnam isnt even seen as that type anymore oof no biggie, we all have lives outside of Discord hope everything works out in your favor big shocker, ik XD oof its about 50/50 between male Avery and female Raleigh atm well rip Platinum this thursday Dammit, it’s still not available for iOS devices ☹️ Also peep that male Avery Apple will always have my heart, sorry not sorry Nah fam I drop it so many times yet it still functions, despite me being a klutz Sup can you customize the characters or is it like MW and TC&TF where you just work with an already-established character background? now im wondering if its ever gonna be available for iOS ://// oh ok still sounds pretty cool wow nah not really unless you count thievery from a corrupt businessman, then try The Heist: Monaco dear lord oof nah she gets one female LI yup Dani i mean lets be real, the MC's sexuality just depends on the player so go for the lesbian route lol RoE Katie is straight as an arrow oof i personally ship those two ye beautiful aww shit here we go again our leader is back!!! o: welcome! @Deleted User ikr i still need it to be available on the app store ;-; as far as i know, its only available in certain countries and for those who are modded on this server with whatever apk stands for i wanna say im excited for it but judging by what i've heard, only one story has a male main character so thats a letdown. genderlocked readings everywhere i go smh doesnt say anywhere lmao Lmao wait, what is that supposed to be? i stared at it for a solid five minutes and still couldnt figure it out XD ah ok, thanks for clearing that up for my dumb ass nah id sacrifice Chloe bc i care too much about the general population to selfishly sacrifice a whole town for one person but thats just me with my morals xd dont get me wrong, I love Chloe, but why bother putting off the inevitable? its clear to me that shes supposed to die but like, i couldnt kill a bunch of people just to save one person @Altair true nobody should have to die but it is what it is messing with fate ig if you interfere then boom, consequences Nathan had mental health issues well thanks to Max, there's multiple timelines so i think it was for the sole purpose of finding Rachel Amber's body and find justice for her bc think about it finding Rachel's body and preventing Chloe from dying ultimately results in the tornado finding the body and letting Chloe die, nothing happens reality stays the way it was before some speculate that Rachel gave Max the powers so that she and Chloe can find her body and find justice to take down Mark and Nathan like the sole purpose was just to find Rachel's murderer but yeah sorry not sorry, I'd prefer sacrificing Chloe than a whole ass town and you cant change my mind exactly she wanted her mom and david and everyone else to live she admitted to being selfish rachel amber dies so there's that oh and william Butterfly Effect really is a headache tho XD honestly who tf came up with that? Life certainly is oh hell yes definitely i have several songs from the LiS OST in my spotify XD oh yes her too from BTS would never have known about Syd Matters if it wasnt for the first LiS Obstacles and To All of You is literally a high school passing period mood i legit mimicked Max on the bus ride to school every morning and her walking through the school hallway XD hells yes Crosses by Jose Gonzalez, yup @Deleted User glad im not the only one XD and honestly PriceAmber forever sorry but Bay over not even Bae to begin with i liked Kate and Joyce and them David even redeemed himself well that depended whether or not you let David kill him by telling him the truth or lie about Chloe's fate Bay > Not even Bae to begin with PriceAmber forever i'd want them to be in the afterlife together happy and free i imagine Chloe introducing Rachel to William Max x Warren @Deleted User go off Chloe deserves happiness but like with Rachel ^ selfish tsk tsk she wanted Joyce to live she accepted her fate she acknowleged that she's selfish if me and Dewqs are going down, y'all are coming with us in the damn tornado bruh Amber is not even with them physically . AmberPrice in the afterlife Bay > Not even bae to begin with i see zero chemistry with Pricefield Warren is good for Max WARREN IS HOT for Max Chloe is only hot for Rachel the two should reunite in spirit What @Deleted User said Arcadia Bay is beautiful and so therefore it should remain that way Just exterminate the Prescott family and everyone’s problems are solved Warren x Max is good Nah Yello Nevrakis ancestors be twinning if thats the case or tripleting??? that a thing? XD For those of us are who are old Pixelberry nostalgics, I finally caught up but now I’m sad 😢 Ah hell 😭 HSS, Hollywood U, those were left unfinished 💔 It was. They both were When Pixelberry was all about the Clash of Clans concept except with schools and you’re not battling anyone. You’re just sending in-game characters on quests Despite those two being under the ownership of Electronic Arts But yes I remembered The Troublemakers and The Maskmaker. Good stuff 👌🏼 Cause of Death by Electronic Arts Good timezone! i dont see any rule against advertising another server so I'd say go for it just recently, a Storyscape server was advertised so i think its ok but probably only here in #general hmm, its Choices related so i guess, sure np just binge-watching The Big Bang Theory rn, wbu? ooh anime i didnt see it anywhere in the rules so i just assumed sorry that i did yeah i mentioned that forgot to mention that it was an admin xd honest to god, im still a discord noob so i never know the protocol, even after reading the rules of that server ooh viv approved anyway Not quite word for word, but dat foreshadowing tho u famous Oh ok here we go Across the Void REEEEEEEEEEEE xD High School Story Pixelberry's first ever game app as their own independent company C: And that’s it folks ;-; sorry for the spam i'll delete them if it's an issue just wanted to share these welcome! @detok Welcome! @mellamaet Ooh this should be fun BSC 2 because of Sawyer Tf That’s just downright disrespectful and disgusting to the actual people with actual illnesses smh It’s nothing to rp about BSC has Sawyer BSC has Sawyer ^ aww gawd ^ also ^ I’ll be honest, whether BSC gets a book 3 or not doesn’t faze me. I love Sawyer but like I’m okay with it ending after two books. If it gets a third book, then it’s whatevs It was a struggle for me as well to memorize some of the acronyms or initials. My dumbass thought MC meant Minecraft for whatever reason lmfao @oge found it!!!!! Damn brb Ikr lol I love Mother Jennifer and her “mother with an actual heart” antics Ikr Exactly Mommy 👏🏼 Jennifer 👏🏼 will 👏🏼 be 👏🏼 great 👏🏼 role 👏🏼 model Welcome! @papaya xd there's no states at all Kyo lmao *if only* give the baby his binky You just gotta love Russians He still won’t get squat tho lmao @oge i think that just about wraps it up xD np Happy day of birth! @✧*ᴍɪᴋᴀᴇʟᴀ*✧ 🥳🥳 Hope you get that prenup you always wanted 😏 Lmao the timing of those responses @kyo hot like Satan Jr's ass for Southern California both XD ik its normal at this point for SoCal in October but im so over this heat i want hoodie weather to come back pronto there was one weekend where we had nothing but gloomy skies and drizzle and i fricken loved it SoCal really teased me like that smh done deal rip GIMME must be nice ^actually me tho Don’t they all Agreed with Hilda, there’s not enough gay male romance out there in the world of storytelling apps If I wanted to see that, I’d play The Sims 3 or gain enough courage to play Coming Out on Top xd Oh yeah that too haha At least there you got to be the Father of the Year Unlike a certain book that’s released every Friday smh Well if you’re into MOTY, that’s releasing today (depending on your timezone) Mother of the Year, you get to see all the happy-go-lucky adventures of a single mom and a smart ass daughter Deadbeat, like the cliche literature he is smh Anyway I do hope you feel better emotionally soon. Plenty of Choices books that can help you ease what you’re going through And physically, can never forget that Ewwwwwww Are you in one of those AP/Honors classes? Rip Explains the summer homework And handwritten of all things, this isn’t the Stone Age anymore No..that’s not how it works Handwritten is using a pencil or other writing utensil. Typing is on a computer Are you kidding me? My schools relied on printing shit out I haven’t had to do handwritten writings since middle school High school is when teachers start hyping the MLA format and whatever crap For me anyway What kinda 19th century school do you go to that is just NOW using modern technology???? I’m sorry but I’m weirded out rn Grades online and printing essays has been the norm for me xd The irony is I have some classmates that can’t even afford a nice printer at home so they gotta pay to use my school library’s printers Yeah they can be Listen to me, a spoiled American middle class college student not even knowing the struggles But anyway, I can’t ever imagine writing 20 whole pages with just a pencil. That’s cruel and unusual Like I’ve written in-class essays before but they’re a few pages and it’s only for occasions like finals week The way you worded it, is the public type of format? Like everyone in class can see them? Oh bc you were worried about your classmates seeing your Fs in Maths iirc XD Ah gotcha Rip Math sucks GL We have a “No Child Left Behind” type of method Basically we have to get tested at least once every year to be able to move on, if I’m even interpreting that correctly Somehow we get improved test scores and I’m not even sure how that even works It’s some kind of witchcraft or something Something like that in the US as well. I’ve only actually failed one class that was required in order to graduate high school and that was fricken geometry so I took that one summer school class I failed Spanish III and Precalculus and I was able to graduate anyway bc apparently, those aren’t important for four year colleges Even I barely get it I’ve hated math since the beginning of time Yeah it’s kinda cool I blame my Spanish III teacher for ruining the language for me forever tho. She’s the reason why I failed bc her methods are shit Apparently Spanish They often had bad attitudes And I was never motivated because of it Every other teacher I’ve had has been a little easygoing Foreign language is my biggest struggle I’ve lost interest in Spanish and even my parents Vietnamese language a long time ago XD I’m a horrible person I just simply don’t care for the need to be bilingual tbh. It just seems like so much work and I already have enough on my plate to memorize I know, thanks for that But those people do tend to shame people like me on social media. Not directly targeting me but will say things like “It’s disgusting to only know one language” like wow okay I didn’t realize that your lifeline depended on that yeah well the only things that are gonna be on mine is Vietglish and Spanglish xd i too am from a viet household and my mom always blasts viet drama and stuff my whole life, yet my brain refuses to retain it like i can read Viet off of a piece of writing like a whole ass paragraph but can never come up with a whole ass sentence off the top of my head and i cant write either, there's also that. i can only copy lol that fact is probs true. according to my dad's home videos of Baby Me, i spoke up a vietnamese storm during that time, then thanks to being more exposed to a westernized culture at my elementary school and childhood tv shows on NickJr, my brain chose to stick with English only @azula you go girl! @MaxShadows she’s in the psychiatric ward She didn’t go into detail but that is her own business Cramming for an exam I have in an hour and 15 minutes but overall, peachy 👌🏼 YAY! 🎉🎉 Must’ve been a blast I’m the only Thomas voter by far lmao I may not be into MOTY but he is fine as hell Wish I could pursue him as a fellow single father @MaxShadows Mother of the Year lmao @leitgo65 OH 2 will be releasing in a few weeks or so, before 2020, that’s all I know. Then there’s BOLAS also this winter and DS perhaps around early 2020 Oh and HSS CA on the 30th of this month Book 3 TE is having a holiday special And finally, only one very recent gen-unlocked book was AME 3 np hola Let’s just hope the gender content gets better by the time Storyscapes is available for my country @kyo oh shit thanks for telling me that! I literally just checked the App Store and it’s finally here in the U.S.!!!!!!!!! Haha I haven’t checked since Monday and wow it took me this long to figure it out Ooh send the link plz ^ My dad and his sisters gave me their seasonal allergies Lol rip At least you’ll save money on shampoo DaDdy anyone? Tempted to keep the name Edgewater but idk Or I might rename it to Arcadia Bay from LiS @Raven SimCity 2013 Basically a strategy game where you can build up cities and watch them grow. It’s really fun and I’ve been really into it lately To name it Edgewater or Arcadia Bay 🤔 Ehh I’ll sleep on it Hehe yup Still good imo Tho not so popular with the majority Cities Skyline is the most popular city-building game right now but it seems a little too overwhelming for me I’d go with SimCity any day, no matter how much EA sucks sometimes Way better than twilight, for sure Cục gôm Ah I see what you did there BitLife 😉 Omg yes But sadly like it is stated, they’re no longer in the App Store or even available for android devices Oooo Well then by all means, try them out Oof D&D and TRM being good books LMFAO ✋🏼 I’m either diamond farming a certain day or I’m genuinely enjoying a book I’m sticking around a little while just to wait for the good content to come back but other than that, I’ve been into Storyscape lately Mhm Especially X-Files Shit is cray Same here Along with the long ass road to BOLAS and DS i mean it ended a while ago xd Literally anything else > The Royal Series ^ Ugh i hate that i cant have him as a guy i mean male MC i hate that i cant have him as a male MC its just not the same ;-; welp its a hard genderlocked life, for us the smile? oof it never really did to begin with No More like a whole ass day ago lol Ok but I’m pretty sure you were referring to that Cordonia conversation we had with Viv a few days ago At this point, it was two days ago for me You didn’t respond until more than 24 hours later why am i like that always trynna be right and get the last word xd Nah, not really. You’d just be looking to talk about something you both have in common Confidently, might I add Nothing weird about that But it might also depend how well you know this person??? Ah so like completely strangers then Well then still, I’m sure you’ll have no problem at all trynna talk about cars Oooo Yeah 😅 Subtle XD homophobia mentality continues to baffle me ugh i saw that tweet but...uh...great job with protecting unborn fetuses only for them to end up in negligent foster care, ya pro-lifers realistically pro-birthers smh or being raped by a blood relative and people are concerned about homosexuality damaging the human race LMFAOOO ^BRUH TRUE so we can conclude: Abortion good. Homosexuality good. Human Race: a huge damn mess .__. fast and *furi*ous *furi*al friends Hello And welcome @Annabelle B Oh shit and many others Yeah that freaked me out a bit ngl No worries, same lol Heyo! Oop Yello Hullo Welcome! @johnk @kaitoo welcome! This is the place to be for that! XD we keepin this server alive 😄 i was only in two or three of those and Benji just happened to be in them XD damn i only got to hear two of your voices 😦 and they heard my hideous one lol math sucks you sound so British ik i was playing dumb XD ooo nope XD That’s what it is 😉 @johnk we do about two polls per month to change the server icon Ah Ngl this is why I personally don’t like that we can pick the gender of the LIs It can be so confusing the more Pixelberry does it Welp @azula in due time, dear leader 😉 Winter I believe 2020 We have several obstacles before we get to the good stuff No srsly I wish that were an option *You have reached the end of Baby Bump. Thanks for aborting!* @essence nice introduction lol Man I love the BitLife game This is such an unfortunate name XD In my household, Christmas is all about the religious part of it .-. @KaiaLou agreed tho. I could do with less distant relatives that I barely know or talk to XD Well as a Catholic, I am obligated to say yes And mean it lol But yeah, I never had Santa in my childhood or even presents 🤷🏻‍♂️ And tbh, I don’t mind Consumerism really has poisoned literally every holiday in existence United States: Oh Veteran’s Day is coming and you want to honor your great great grandfather who fought in WWII? Save 50% off on our usually expensive cars! And believe it or not, I’m not too big a fan of Christmas music Dunno, I barely know who they are 😅 if you live alone with a dog away from the nearest annoying civilization, we can be full fledged besties oof i relate to that on a spiritual level rip idk any school that doesnt let you at least have one week off during the week of christmas mine was also like that up until college now i have 3 depends on where you live if you happen to have heavy snow, then it varies, christmas or not i have a 3 week winter gap in between semesters mine varies every year but at least my school's calendar tells us ahead of time how long our breaks are It’s practically summer still by the time I start the new year of school and it will remain summer until winter. Like we do not have autumn But yeah, August/September seems to be the main general start of the school year Not to mention the fact that my entire life, I’ve had to spend my birthday on the first week of school /: I love that game even more now XD I mean I don’t blame them They’re not as easygoing or lenient as Pixelberry in terms of that They mean business and actually want business literally scat

It’s not some made-up excuse :LMFAOdead: They have no idea They really don’t, half the time Smh It’s ok when the illness sufferer makes fun of themselves but others aren’t allowed to do it? Genuine question Fake it till you make it: words to live by Me out in public If only it was that easy @azula phat mood about the dog It may or may not have almost happened to me before Speaking of dogs, my dad named our new robot vacuum after my dog and it’s the cutest notification on my phone whenever it says “RoombaRusty has finished its job.” Ironically Rusty is scared shitless of the vacuum whenever it comes towards him All dogs are like that with Roomba tho lol It kinda does but it still can’t get into small spaces like behind the toilet in the bathroom So I still gotta sweep With my trusty broom It actually still can, which is why whenever I’m still home and he’s not around, my dad asks me to watch it closely and make sure that it doesn’t get stuck xd same i totally have not been using a probably illegitimate website that streams free movies and tv shows thus not spending any money whatsoever so is being modded on mobile games yet here you are still still a pirate to begin with back in the day https://ww1.123movies.link/123movies-4?utm_campaign=status_page&utm_medium=status_page&utm_source=status_page you're welcome kids @azula "itty bitty titty committee" a real tongue twister xD maybe they have a secret craving for breastmilk "Drink breastmilk.

His sudden appearance and apparent miracles spark a growing international following, casting doubts around who he really is, a case investigated by a CIA officer." O Medhi Dehbi right? bc if so, then u right 😳 wow Belgian AND Tunisian hnnnnnghhhhhh yeah just by reading that premise, it seems bad actor is good looking but the overall show is yeesh Humans... @azula you mean the ISIS BitLife thing? Oh BitLife is a really cool life simulator game only  it’s through a bunch of texts, words, and decision-making concepts! It’s both hilarious and serious at the same time But who were you referring to when you asked if something happened? @azula oh so you know how I said BitLife can be hilarious? Well there’s a common interaction you can have with in-game friends when they confess to you that they’re joining ISIS, you get three choices. Support them, report them to proper authorities, or unfriend them XD Oml no Lmfao He plays BitLife too so he making a joke :3 Oh damn!

Both my parents were born and raised in former Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) Sometimes My grandparents were just....there.....existing I barely understood what they said so Oop It was such a pain having to nod and pretend I understood what they’re saying whenever they try and talk to me 💀 Now that was awkward times Happy birthday server daddy! @red hot silly pepper @azula hold up, he’s a cute guy AND he hates gun girl? That’s the best kind of guy Don’t even get me started 😓 Believe it or not, my dad who is in his 60s understands more about FAFSA than me And he saved up for community college on his own All I can advise is to read the instructions VERY VERY carefully Word for word Don’t miss anything Don’t leave anything out But yeah applying for student aid is a bitch It’s a full-on interrogation about your economic background xd Anyway sorry that I derailed from your question a bit About the translating to your parents thing, this is all I can tell you My dad knows a fair amount of English so he understood a bit of it while helping me out with my FAFSA I had to help him out a bit here and there, translating some things for him But overall, we worked together despite hating every single minute of it Free Application for Federal Student Aid It’s an American thing when it comes to student loans Oh yes the deadlines vary by state Good luck btw Kyo *Australia and other various countries laughing in free university* *sends you my love across various cities bc ik we live in the same state XD* Ooh which one?

Probably the wrinkles He looks way older than the MC Not to mention being a total Tanner Sterling knock-off Probably Ooh ok Discord o?h ?Oh WB!!! "become?" its reached PEAK disaster since the beginning there are people that actually LIKE Baby Bump 🤢 they actually DEFEND it there can be extremely oversensitive freak shows within the Facebook fandom majority of them are the Facebook moms, no surprise there but sure, keep ignoring the countless medical inaccuracies, lack of women's health education, and lack of ACTUAL pregnancy struggles that DONT come from the POV of a husband plot twist: its an alien It’s demonic and evil and a genetic mutation. That’s how IT is @BigHutchHO what did you do? :0 Oof xd Lol I haven’t played it in weeks because I could not in good conscience continue playing it after the most recent nasty ugly ass update Im praying all the negative reviews will convince the developers to revert the changes and return the characters back to the way they were before Or if by some reason people actually like the new looks, they could add in a feature that switches between classic mode and new mode at any time The infants in the game are terrifying af We werent talking about TRH. We were talking about BitLife @MaralinaSakura oh shit really? Thank god My favorite is pepperoni with meatball pieces Can’t go wrong with a classic 👏🏼 SAME Anyway this is my favorite https://youtu.be/o0itR1yvj1s @azula couldn’t agree more. Ig when a series becomes milked, every little aspect of it becomes extremely irritating, including the la-la happy fairytale music XDD I honestly don’t get why anyone would do that tbh The OST in the actually GOOD books are what make the story come alive To each their own. Anyway, I personally want to hear the music, even in the most shitty books because I hate being in a quiet room That series was milked so I understand why you hated the OST It’s like me and Viv with TRR Don’t we all Since the very first HSS was released (not Class Act) I did download Choices the VERY first day it made its debut but I got frustrated with the lack of customizable male MCs so I kinda quit and went back to Pb’s previous games HSS Prime and HWU When I heard there was gonna be a Choices version of HSS, I thought why the hell not, give it a second chance Yeah that just means those books were character-locked. Not genderlocked. There’s a difference between the two @MaralinaSakura girl, your conscience/imagination is both terrifying and beautiful all at the same time owo Oh HELL no Can’t relate. I’m somehow one of the very few in the world to get a decent night’s sleep with lucid dreaming here and there F And my next class for the day is starting oop ^ The Asian family method of raising kids > WALK IT OFF Anything good or bad that happens to them meh some races are more strict than others Welcome @Lady Cassandra ! I wasn’t gonna watch it to begin with when I learned there’s no singing and no Mushu so 🤷🏻‍♂️ 123movie ftw Not for me I use 123movies.link And I’m supposed to get some FAFSA shit done today American student loan program @kyo thanks same to you Damn India is mean XD They no like getting free entertainment. Sad :/ Have fun! Eww Imagine choosing TRH2 :LMFAOdead: Or even CA for that matter LMFAO OH ftw Had he gotten more screen time, I probably would’ve chosen Raf Bryce stan all the way XD She really did Brycey 🥰🥰🥰🥰 Kyra was friggin annoying Her relentless flirting was just a big ass nope Yup That is definitely why I don’t want Ethan The creepy eyes and giraffe neck were bad enough Not arguing So yeah anyway big ass nope to Kyra 👎🏼 Oop Had I gotten the choice to tell her I don’t swing that way, I would’ve tolerated her as a person She’s still doing chemo towards the end of Book 1 iirc Hah Omfg @Tyr yes pls I- O WHERE TF IS THE BELLYBUTTON So wtf was he even attached to when he was yeeted out of the uterus? :WTFthonk: Or can people actually get those surgically covered up just bc Woah :pleb: excuse me no im more of a Drewcubine REEEEE F ^ Music helps me ESCAPE from others I actually have no shame in sharing my tastes the more I grow up These days, I’m getting more comfortable rolling down my window on a hot day and blasting Owl City omw to school 🤣 Rap and hip hop is loud noise Every other genre is fine Oof F I can respect that too Rip Damn Ffs xd I’ve taken a whole semester of ASL last spring and that can never be enough to teach me about the hearing impaired and their struggles It’s sad but also they learn to love and embrace themselves, despite whatever other people think I admire those who still go to concerts anyway and there it is, a sign interpreter up on the stage signing the music xd Imagine using music bots @kaitoo XD Jkjk But Fr tho My preference is borrowing my dad’s 2013 Toyota Camry hybrid with a built in Bluetooth device, and just straight up blasting my tunes for all to hear. But of course sometimes I’m afraid of sharing so I keep my windows shut as common courtesy to those around me XD It’s so therapeutic for me to listen to music in a car alone When I’m driving somewhere Meh, I’ve been doing it forever now. Headphones while walking to my classes, sitting on the school bus to and from high school, driving to and from college every day on the freeway. Maybe I am subjecting myself to hearing loss but idk So far I’m doing okay but ig I should take it easy eventually For the sake of keeping all my senses intact Yeah actually I never go for max volume Just like half way or so depending on the quality of the song that’s playing Apparently I consider half volume loud But again, it depends My high school plays music on the PA system during passing period and most of the time it’s just classics from the old days like Beatles and shit Idrc for the music that plays while I’m walking to my next class so of course I put in headphones the minute I step outside of my original class and on to my next one I’m privileged enough to know that everything about me is working fine It’s surprising because I spend so much time in front of screens but I never need glasses I can sit in the back of a classroom and still see the whiteboard up front just fine Cursed Ok that’s actually very good Is it the head partially covering up the Second Year? XD Yeah I wish it was real Haha it’s fine Viv I genuinely feel bad for the guy Book 2 never starts off with 2 chapters ): Ye No one deserves the AJ treatment lol Yup Benji likes none of the LIs oop It really wasn’t It was only through diamond choices where you got to learn more about him Bryce was god-tier I said what I said Basically yeah “I can be friendly if you stay out of my way” *smiley face* And people say Bryce had an ego 🙄 Jackie is just too much YAY! :pleb: Ye It’s the cover we deserve Yeah no need for the casual outfit xd Paramedic uniform good Yeet LMFAO Big oof Blurrr the necc Not confirmed ones anyway We’ll see in a few chapters Perhaps My vote is going for Lahela always DA ONLY WAY Nuuuuu Ye Even princesses need vacations Best of luck it gets old real quick i just want a book where the MC isnt an automatic gambler/alcohol drinker. that concept is also overdone in Choices most of the time, you're always gonna end up in SOME card game, and forced to drink anything alcoholic lmfao and that aint it with me LMAO deadass when i turn 21, the only celebratory drink i'll be taking is water bc American 18yos are dumb us Westerners tend to be more wild well when you put it like that :WTFthonk: Western culture is wack, ngl i could never xd i accidentally had alcohol once, did NOT care for it did NOT like it bold of you to assume i go to clubs OMFG SAME @Deleted User BUT I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE RUM WAS IN THERE I WAS CHEATED AND LIED TO you were 8 YEARS OLD???? wow anyway that rum chocolate nearly ruined chocolate for me tbh the rum chocolate i had was literally shaped like a beer bottle and it was fucking disgusting how does one ruin perfectly good chocolate by putting RUM in it it boggles the mind im very anti-alcohol oop but y'all of course can do it if you like it its just not my cup of tea, or rum xd ooh same with mine, that i know of anyway they drink beer iirc, but not enough to get drunk bc thats a big no-no for my catholic family and then there's me, a very sheltered kid who stayed in his comfort zone his entire life only ever drinking age-appropriate beverages night Woah As if I didn’t need more reasons to hate TRH Fuck, this world is a mess... ROD? Didn’t care much for that one tbh Whether or not it gets a sequel, won’t faze me The very westernized kind? XD Colt is another term for a cow iirc It actually is Oh ok And yeah, lots of male American boomers have Colt for a name Oof They are It Lives Aka a god tier series Eyyyy I’m Andrew XD True tho @MaralinaSakura I’m both I’m the ultimate Gay-sian Fear me 😂 Because 🤷🏻‍♂️ My parents’ reasoning for naming me Andrew was and I quote “it’s just easier to remember” Also because they’re catholic as hell True tho Viv Frankly, I’m glad they gave me a non-Vietnamese name My birth certificate says Andrew but at home, I have a Vietnamese name Uff Bom Forgot what it means lmao But it’s from a Vietnamese nursery song Oop XD ? O Yeah what she said I’ve never even seen those Oh wait I think I might have Now that Maralina said what they are XD Bread rolls good Not that I know of Wack No I do not xd I only ever see commercials but my parents don’t bother with Yakult It’s milk right? Ah My parents only ever drink almond or soy milk Never Yakult tho 🤣 I drink homogenized milk and I have zero shame So many people hate it but I drink it anyway It’s refreshing XD Good one Oh yes ma’am they do My dad has gotten the hang of English but my mom, eeehhhhh LMFAO YES THEY DO THO OML Basically you speak perfect American English Lol Ooo Woah you lived here at one point? Oh nice Cool 😂 :jebus: Oh god Wtf :LMFAOdead: OMFG IM ACTUALLY DYING I’m just picturing a little girl laughing at a pixelated deer dying Viv has that dark humor And I love it From a young age too :0 I was neutral at a lot of childhood movie deaths My parents never consulted somebody religious whenever I acted a certain way. They’d just whip out a clothing hanger or the end of a broomstick and wack me with it Nah the only muscles my parents have is their loud ass voices that sound like hyenas when they mad XD Prolly not Natural selection at its finest Hehe LOL :pleb: Heccin educate Damn we gotta get together to do that ): And I’m at school rn rip OMFG Mara No XD I’ve got like half hour before my next class starts Im just sitting in a half empty hallway rn Pretty peaceful tho, my voice would literally echo 😳 I said half empty People literally coming in and out XD I’m fat but I ain’t that fat :LMFAOdead: Idk whether to feel insulted or flattered Bold of you to assume I’m smart 🤣🤣🤣🤣 My brain is barely functional as it is It can only handle so much Old people :dva: But not you Viv 😂 You got what we call beauty rest At least I think it only applies if you sleep hella early Idek Pffffft nah Oof My mom sleeps at 10 PM while my dad at around midnight or 1 AM She’s in her late 50s and he’s in his late 60s 😐 Damn tho Mara My parents had me hella late tho so that explains why I’m so screwed up in the head And their sleep schedules really be like that Tbf tho, my dad’s retired so he can delete his sleep schedule Ooo My mom had me at 34 i believe What’s more shocking is that many people my age are already having kids and they still in college :WTFthonk: I’m fricken 19 and my peers are already getting married I’ve had at least two classmates who had gotten pregnant in high school BaBu just has a shitty representation is all We stan that kind of parental advice 👏🏼👏🏼 So many old fashioned parents are pressuring their kids to grow up and have kids of their own and it’s just stupid That whole “you’ll change your mind when you get older” is such bullshit It’s toxic Exactly The shitty parents are the ones that claim they wanted kids in the first place Adoption good “Continuing the bloodline” is so overrated AGREED MARA People need to overlook the whole “my grandchild should have my eyes” and start thinking about the very broken foster system and help out those kids first Oh lord... Yikes That’s very backwards and sad Very true tho If the family’s history of health is very bad, continuing the bloodline isn’t worth even MORE of those running around :jebus: Incest is still very real in most royal families and southern USA 🤮 How bad is it? O LMAO Oof XD Oh ew Istg people need to get their head out of their asses and realize that bloodlines are overrated and should not be continued if the family has a history of health problems. You’re ultimately gonna give birth to a financial crisis Well a bigger one than it already is EXACTLY No diaper changes XD Yup If you’re pro-life, you’re pro-alien :WTFthonk: Ikr Boggles the mind Like mind your own damn business It’s not your baby so it’s not your call That whole book is glorified pro-life propaganda Would’ve been hella interesting if it discussed abortion Clint Covington Because they’re stupid? 🧐 I don’t even remember Yeah but it’s a diamond scene The unintended baby making was a diamond scene lmao Pretty much Ye Like “oh rich man pls plant a crotch monster inside me because we too lazy to open up that drawer that’s a few feet away from us” Damn very nice Ugh I wish bitlife reverted to THAT version This is still ugly af Damn my class just got cancelled despite us only being in here for a few minutes I’m actually sad because it’s my favorite class ): @MaralinaSakura it’s called Animal Nutrition Oh wait where you asking “Which” to someone else earlier? F Well in response to literally everything that went down, class got cancelled, am now home, anti vaxxers are dumbasses and coronavirus ain’t shit And being sick in general sucks MEDIA: YOURE GOING TO DIE
Literally everyone else: good F XD I’m just waiting on my anthropology class to begin No ma’am I have not “The series is set in an alternate world where humans and anthropomorphic animals live side by side, taking place mostly in Hollywood (later known as "Hollywoo" after the "D" in the Hollywood Sign is stolen and destroyed). BoJack Horseman is the washed-up star of the 1990s sitcom Horsin' Around, which told the story of a bachelor horse trying to raise three young orphans. Now living in relative obscurity in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills, BoJack plans a big comeback to celebrity relevance with a tell-all autobiography to be written by his ghostwriter Diane Nguyen. BoJack also has to contend with the demands of his agent and on-again-off-again girlfriend Princess Carolyn, the misguided antics of his freeloading roommate Todd Chavez, and his former rival Mr. Peanutbutter, who was once the star of his own sitcom Mr. Peanutbutter's House.” O Cool I might give it a try one of these days Tbf, this is #general. Literally anything we want to talk about can be discussed here That’s NOT about Choices Oop I’m big dumb This is not acceptable before I walk into class Lmao Oof Italy has gotten bad.

Fr? Yikes I don’t get these scenarios. “Public must know but we can’t let them panic!” “Ok then let’s stay silent so that it explodes in an even bigger scandal!” Meanwhile US government is so worried about the economy that they poured literally everything into stocks to calm investors’ nerves and people be whining about “how we gonna pay off student debt?” “Pfffft rich people are more important than students in debt” Yes lol It’s an educated guess Paige no We wuv you Viv Nausea and gut feeling 👀 :/ :WTFthonk: Lockdown means literally nobody on the streets Ordering online doesn’t make a difference Reeee Yup My mom hoards stuff in our fully stocked fridge so I won’t have to worry about going out to eat 🙃 :c Om nom That...doesn’t help Sneaky sneak Noice Oof NOT WORTH IT Uh Viv is living her best life rn Chips are considered perishables iirc She found them but she ain’t touching them Beats me Because logic runs this world :WTFthonk: They’ve got bigger fish to fry Well by their standards anyway Rice has become a valued commodity 😢 Wtf has this world come to New Jersey accents are also smexy As long as it’s not from the Valley, that’s fine Southern accents can be smexy too We don’t got anything impressive lmao Just regular Apart from a heavy population of Latinos Whom btw Are Smexy Not just smexy but downright hot Usually tall, dark, and handsome :OOF: Yeah two weeks has been the recommendation for schools and businesses lately My mom had to come home early from work yesterday because literally nobody was coming in So she gets a two week vacation too I’m guessing the only people still working obviously are government officials and the entire healthcare system Are you guys also switching to online classes @Deleted User All my exams could potentially be online so therefore open note, open textbook, that sort of thing Viet food is *chef’s kiss* Pho especially @Deleted User You should try it whenever you get the chance They have it everywhere tho 🤔 @Deleted User same.

My parents figured THAT was when they feel the need to contact me in case of any emergency or just to check up on me, since I took the school bus to and from school Same Mara 🤭 👀 Got it all in one Paige 👍🏼 XD Just Distant Shores in April And possibly With Every Heartbeat sometime this spring no no mention of it in March's newsletter either oop ahem Priya, wanna discuss BB further stay in #choices-chat :eyez: ANYWAY anything can happen to Charles at this point and i wouldnt be fazed im one of those who see him as a scumbag after what he did to Diana AVSP sounds like more hot garbage More rich people nonsense Mixed with sex Sadly Lol :considering: No you’re not the only one All the extroverts in my social media feed are whining about needing socialization and I’m just sitting and chilling lmao My house is my sanctuary tbh FFS BitLife 🤦🏻‍♂️ Bitlife was supposed to be my escape from real life lmfao True :/ :aww: Lmfao Shit Because Anyway yeah speaking of naming countries, as an American, I cannot deny what Mara said about our very very narcissistic and self-centered education system Throughout grades K-5 we’re always taught about the most innocent version of African slavery but by the time I got to college, there was no more sugarcoating. The whites did EXTREMELY shitty things to African Americans even as the country was developing Not to mention our dumbass president who, btw, is handling COVID-19 poorly (side note), can’t even fucking point out a country on a blank map and say its correct name And he has the audacity to threaten our culturally diverse politicians by i quote (Sending them back.) Telling them to go back, whatever bull he’s hopped up on He’s honestly just asking to get roasted because every time he goes on his “Send her back” rants, people can say, “Well can you point out the country on a map so that we know where?” Way better than I could’ve done And I had straight A’s in geography back in high school I was literally the only one who got a perfect score on the final exam The countries weren’t hard to memorize at the time I love social studies The only thing I was ever good at in school I’ve had to had to study it all four years of high school and I didn’t complain 🤷🏻‍♂️ Smh I mean, whatever helps... :WTFthonk: 🤦🏻‍♂️ F for Africa XD @Tyr dw that’s pretty impressive The USA has 50 and it just allows us to run our little state our own way In many states, LGBT rights are supported and in some others, not so welcomed It’s very culturally different That’s pretty much the USA too Agreed with Bread tho Show off :eyez: I can’t for my life remember the podunk redneck states kek Like I can name them because of a childhood song I had to memorize about states but probably not point them out on a blank map “Fifty Nifty United States” 😳 We ain’t nifty tho Alphabetical order, yeah @ill miss you rae https://youtu.be/5pOFKmk7ytU Ye 9th grade geography memories We actually listened to this song in class on the very first day Hell yeah I’d be down Well duh That would be best Lmao now we have to name all exceptions and non-exceptions Because apparently, there are still “technically” and “not technically” countries to this day I genuinely find that surprising Anyway to answer your question Kyo Wales is considered a “legal jurisdiction” It’s a constituent country of the United Kingdom So all in all, Idk .-. Idk hockey :WTFthonk: :eyez: Is that just called regular hockey? Ooo Daaaaaaaaaaamn... Luckily idc for sports so I don’t bother being offended when a country is offended using sports references lel Oh ok cool Lmfao I don’t blame you We ain’t special I’d avoid people when visiting another country too 👀 *looks at American football* I mean there’s tackling and risk of head injuries, even with helmets So yeah oof I know Furi American football more deals with HEAD injuries specifically Ya yeet And the men in sports uniforms aren’t so bad looking either 👀 Ikr ~~mayhaps~~ My confidence is literally down and up but mostly down a mother pupper feeding her pups isnt NSFW its all good, i like to mispell on purpose sometimes too XD time zone buddies Paige :3 its all good in the hood now ikr imagine exactly its safe for work yuppers to the puppers have you seen the film Onward yet Viv? its so friggin good yeah, no hint of disney, now that you mention it one of the female characters mentions having a gf so im all like, hell yes which one? does it have a name yet? o tf xD oh yeah the movie about souls after death seems really cool actually, touching on the subject of death for kids but agreed with viv, thats a lil dark oh yeah i mean its death either way same oh yeah the other name for Halloween @azula YUSTIN VEEVER how so? no so basically rich people gaining clout from singing about the virus and self-isolation and resources we take for granted oy vey Oh nice I’m 175 oof You said you had medical conditions right? Damn I’m sorry Jesus ): *hugs back* You’d definitely be Jade Viv But at the same time, I don’t see you as mean and scary XD kek Ooo Tiny but mighty ~~pls don’t kill me because I called you short~~ :aww: Dipper Pines, Ian Lightfoot, Emma Hawkins, and occasionally Andre Harris That’s amazing God I miss Gravity Falls Her sarcasm is so amazing Also this XD Of course lol Lmao Misleading title :LMFAOdead: I can imagine that kek :mmYea: asdfghjkl I’m a big Squidward mood the minute I turned 18 No actually this is more like me I’m definitely Shaggy grand turismo now that was childhood 👀 Cool Ya yeet Yay It’s coming the first week of April so obviously yeah But of course, that’s up to the staff They are strongly similar :WTFthonk: Rip :pleb: Pffft siblings are overrated. My younger brother was a snitch my whole life so he’s essentially just a little shit who happens to live with me kek Praise be YouTube’s suggestion algorithm If I ever walked in on that.... Discord is being slow rn I feel another outage coming Mine are starting this week inb4 the entire information superhighway gets gridlocked from handling too much traffic as far as i know, i only have my chemistry class on zoom k god pls no Book 2 of that trash better be an April Fools Joke or so help me i will riot tends to make light of a dark subject we havent even done that but okay go off ig cool story 2020 better say sike on April 1st, i'd like that very much imagine xd calling program Paige kinda like Skype for business peeps making meetings its different for a lot of classes and teachers/professors theres barely enough room at my house so my PC has to be in the living room and anyone in my family could just walk in 😳 lol Doge "Tomatoes are generally accepted as vegetables for another reason. They are not sweet. Other fruit that is generally accepted as vegetables include zucchini, cucumber, avocado, bell peppers, pumpkin and butternut squash. There's a general assumption that all fruit are sweet and all vegetables are not." -some internet search @kaitoo wait i can make a compromise https://tenor.com/view/why-not-both-gif-11478682 do you not know the reverse jokes Priya? xd its a big meme XD when someone says "no u" you respond with "uno reverse card" i think so? ugh damn, right before my mom called me to eat lunch D: sowwy, my mama said no XD but have fun y'all bc she is one XD we're talking about namesakes from Choices Priya from BB Andrew from HSS xd it is of Indian origin after all lol its very common, yes yup ye its a unisex name so its a perfect default for both genders yeah from Hero @Deleted User deadass will name my kids using an online randomizer system lmfao bc im not creative or original ooo agreed about IL3 @kyo but its soooooooo much work XD kek nice and its blue too, my fav color but im still too lazy to learn lmao i mean to this day, i'll eat pho with a fork XD im such a westernized Asian everyone be shunning me and i'll own up to it :mmYea: welp im one of the few (possibly only) human(s) who dunno how and is too lazy to get around to learning xd Lmao Duffy in the top right corner Or better yet, fading away into non-existence saying, “Daddy I don’t feel so good...” Yeah there you have it. Puppies are your tutorial for actual human parenting (Not entirely accurate of course, duh. I’m not a BaBu writer) :WTFthonk: See the server icon? It already has 😉 Read what I just said. We’re doing it as well Just the icon anyway Everything else is still normal If you scrolled down the channels of this server, you’ll find out Exactly That answers your question Guess you’ll just have to wait and see Personally i don’t mind whatever happens for April Fool’s. If it gives me laugh, I’ll just simply enjoy it You must be wildly fun at parties Oop It’s hilarious kek Yup :LMFAOdead: QUEEF But Paige It’s Bootyful And? 😂 He really is Scary ass baby that never ages Adam, that one was actually the most normal looking and accurate portrayal to real life babies From OH Ethan Hudson All babies are irl Yes Exactly ^ Smh Lmao Human births are wack Mothers make the excuse that they instantly fall in love with it the minute they lay their eyes on it According to science, no Lying on the back is the social norm Idek I heard that science recommends some type of aquatic birth. Giving birth in some safe liquid filled tank or whatever tf that witchcraft is Cya Doge Beats the hell out of me I just saw a video somewhere and apparently a lot of people recommend that type of birth Water tank Or whatever liquid they use https://youtu.be/Xep1i_1on5M Again, beats the hell out of me Guess you just gotta hope the mouth and nose is facing upwards when it’s yeeted out Like just barely above the surface of the water Personally birthing babies is heavily overrated anyway. Why not clear the foster homes?

So the answer is yes, Egypt is a Middle Eastern country. -Quora apparently so but both ye is that considered a reasonable question? bc now that you bring it up, idek anymore very weird what place in the world ISNT the result of political collateral damage everyone tried to colonize everywhere "aww look its a baby country filled with primitive savages. can we keep them? pls?" oh wow damn woah i know nothing of my grandparents' involvement in any wars but my dad served on the south's side in the Vietnam War, he is very anti-communism and still to this day deadass he uses facebook to troll pro-communism pages its hilarious, i caught sight of his camera roll. its filled with anti-communism memes a lot of it is in Vietnamese but i get the context from the cartoons oh boy lol that movie is god tier for an old timey movie, the effects were phenomenal oooo kk 👀 going back to Hunchback, that was also in the top five def dark, def religious, def god tier right? that one is very cute i thought you were gonna say the actual sisters XD XD lmfao Viv conversation from #choices-chat continuing @azula thats what National Pet Day is for uncultured swines lol F i dont have the tech skillz, sowwy ;-; hmm night Priya Uh ANYWAY loving that new cover 😍 Kinda Idk Eh Meh Could’ve used a male MC But welp Correction: straight female population No It’s not Thank god Where I can bitch about genderlocked books in peace without some shithead harassing me about it?

Hitler was all about blonde hair and blue eyes and he had none of the above :LMFAOdead: Definitely not true. Israel is hella progressive compared to the rest of the Middle East It depends on the country Countries tend to favor their own history more so they teach that Ooo Thank Exactly, there’s never enough time to cover everything in just one academic year Oops White people ruined the UK and the USA Dunno how it happened, but some Caucasian shithead in history just declared out of nowhere, “Hey I’m pasty and pale, that makes me the more dominant race right?” :WTFthonk: 🤔 @kaitoo that’s why we have #music for that lmao @kaitoo :eyez: @Deleted User there is no such thing as too much history 😉 “Mugging up?” Ah Well Ig that depends on your motivation I love history so it was easier for me to memorize stuff Up until the Holocaust, I was such an innocent history lover Then came the Native American treatment, the racism, the treatment of Jews, I was like okay wow we were shit humans back in the day I studied both Europe’s POV and American POV of the world wars And then there are the Americans that preach neutrality up until “whoop as our own civilians died. Let’s hop in on the fun!” REEEEE I know They were secretly helping the Brits WWI we were neutral up until Lusitania and in WWII we were neutral up until Pearl Harbor iirc Ah Pretty much 2-D WWII did help the USA recover from the Great Depression tho True Doge Atomic bombs were just glorified flex-fests Bruh Tru Many people This server tends to be bustling with activity when we get excited about a specific topic 😉 Lmao I hate you Doge Because This Is Anarchy ^ 🧼 Inside good ?

They tend to stay away from that certain lifestyle I’m just trynna not to die from secondhand smoking My college unfortunately is a smoke friendly campus but luckily there are designated smoking areas. People still tend to do it outside of those zones obviously and it pisses me off But of course I don’t have to worry about that for the time being Yikes A summer school class I had back in high school almost got cancelled because some kid who was smoking weed before class wouldn’t confess to stinking up the classroom We would’ve all failed automatically if she hadn’t gotten caught Mind blowing to think she almost ruined it for the rest of us ^ It’s unfair @Deleted User yeah that just seems a bit unnecessary I don’t think I was ever unreasonably kicked out of class, nor in general Shut up :eyez: 😳 Thank you? 😳 Hard worker/stressed out/different High school was hella stressful I hated it there Not to mention the fact that I’ve just received tea that my high school was actually corrupt as hell Teachers getting each other fired through lies and conspiracy and affairs it was beyond ridiculous Of course my hometown was filled with conservative rich white people so literally anyone can get away with anything with the right connections Parents threw such a hissy fit over our LGBTQ Pride Club Lmao if y’all don’t like it “shoving their agenda down their throats,” then move Jeezus Not to mention they’re endangering themselves by not cancelling in-person gatherings Usual family values bullshit Yeah I just wanna stay healthy All the conservative world leaders and corrupt rich people should just perish :OOF: He’s about as clueless and dumb as his American counterpart/twin Natural selection joke Lol Trippy Imagine using light mode Cheap traveling prices does not equal “I should totally travel now” Ew sure why not Priya Redfield was different Redfield was the result of some dark power i think Viv meant the gift to see spirits great story, now i gtg shit my pants oooo ._. i havent had sex period lol im a forever virgin spoopy wah :WTFthonk: .

We can go live sure but only sharing our screens, not our faces I’ve yet to see a video chat option in public servers Going Live just means sharing your screen, but no facecam A handful of us I turn it on just because ~~sometimes I just wanna show off my doggo~~ That’s what we do too No class needs to hear dogs barking and toilets flushing through our thin ass walls ._.

Ooh human anthropology, nice Well cultural anthropology to be specific but that’s lowkey interesting I basically have to relearn Punnett squares in Bio Anthropology and I hate it I don’t get how the majority of my peers find them easy when I barely know whether to capitalize which letter for which box 🥴 Quarantine = irrelevant sleep schedules but eyyyy good morning back Remember Paige? We’re dumb Americans refusing to use Celsius fghjkl Oh pfffffffft 77 is nothing for California With the right amount of outdoor breeze, I’d call that bitchin weather 👌🏼 Just about right Lel California is occasionally like that too actually True tho Paige At least we don’t have it as bad as Australia tho where they literally have an ozone hole right above them But thanks to the stay-at-home orders across the world, I wouldn’t be surprised if that hole were to patch itself up sooner than later The environment is making a decent recovery after all the polluting factories closed and less cars on the road Ugh I just hope this is actually a chance to redeem ourselves. Maybe some of us will start coming to our senses https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/31/asia/coronavirus-lockdown-impact-pollution-india-intl-hnk/?hpt=ob_blogfooterold I mean this is a sight for sore eyes Amazingly This is what it looks like when corporate greed doesn’t get its way Ooh cool! Looks nice with a blue sky huh? Oop Still, gotta admire the fact that for some older peeps, they haven’t seen a blue sky in that area in ten years Did it happen to be sunset? Oh pfffft that’s normal XD Sunset skies have the prettiest colors Wuh? So what’s “purple sky” to your area? O Kk have fun! Say hi to Jake for me 😉 👀 heck yeah I’ve been awake It’s 5:48 PM where I am @azula what’s up? Nah not really. Just my mom’s which is Loan Low-ahh-n That’s as best as I can type it I’m almost certain that there are SOME but I’m not entirely sure I don’t blame the cat Ham is delish lel @azula oh shit lemme rephrase what I said because it made no sense. I meant to say that nearly all Vietnamese names are one syllable and that SOME may or may not have more than one syllable xddd Also yes Hoang is one, I’m pretty sure Curiosity alluring you rn huh? Where my mom’s family live, right in the middle of Ho Chi Minh City, it smells like seafood literally every corner you turn And the rainy days are a big “hell no” mood because it’s all sticky and warm and the streets in my grandparents’ neighborhood get easily flooded, water can get ankle deep But overall, Vietnam is aight @Ne-Rwby-On yes we’re still talking about Vietnam Anyway Vietnam isn’t my “favorite” place in the world but I wouldn’t wanna live there. Just an okay place to visit from time to time Southeast Asia can be wack as hell during their respective rainy seasons Not sure if it’s the geography that was already there to begin with or that the cities were poorly designed Fr?! Damn meh it was often a literal shit show in there anyway White Edward 💋 Ye White Edward is still a winner in my heart UwU ~~Holy chiz, that was cheesy~~ Don’t forget the essential oils and hoping for the best lmao this book is shit tier ew typical Chinese gov't oof wtf istg some people actually DESERVE to be left behind in school Zoom has been having a lot of issues with intruders with their porn lately, its revolting we know night night 👋🏼 oops wrong skin tone lmao hyper, thats what i meant when i said wrong skin tone DONT YELL AT ME :eyez: reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :mmNo: :OOF: Right?! same ): Probs just a stereotype Like how “Oh all Canadians are nice and polite” The internet is a liar :eyez: Uh huh the only Axiom that comes to my mind is the ship from Wall-E and i read every word of the lore tablets, they genuinely fascinate me and it does a better job explaining the BOLAS world's background better than ATV ever could We have And the way is wack I’ve never signed up for an online class in my entire life so it’s all still new to me to this day. I’m slowly getting used to it but it’s not easy I live in a relatively safe neighborhood with good schools, good police, and barely any natural disaster threatens my area so yeah, in-person classes have always been the norm for me There’s a pornhub song?:WTFthonk: omfg extreme wack Lmao This is so weird Sadly you can’t change the mindset of an entire country They’re stuck in their “old and traditional ways and values” and are too stubborn to progress Only thing you can do is raise awareness And if you happen to live in a homophobia hellhole, run like hell and escape and never look back Out of all the Asian countries tho, Japan is hella progressive compared to the rest They have Tokyo pride and everything They’re not perfect but they’re getting there Oh yeah forgot about Taiwan Thank god I was born and raised somewhere liberal and open-minded Tfw 🤦🏻‍♂️ ._. is this the part where im supposed to care? punny even birds can take a hint better than most humans Lmao “Tacky” is putting it mildly nope i was not on discord most of the day ): Wack Why does that remind me of Stephen King’s “Cell” It actually is It’s really good Also I don’t listen to KPOP period so I don’t have to worry about that weird stuff I still have it Bitmoji stories are the most interesting things on there and I only ever wanna see those over my friends’ stories Same hat, Snapchat version of me ~~Priya=big boomer energy~~ Jkjk :hawyee: Sure! T&HM is hilarious i loved it the mainstream shows anyway and some of y'all are really young so we cant blame you guys for not knowing what they are ^ i mean same but i still know what half those shows are xd I don’t even watch Silicon Valley but apparently I’m 89% Jared Dunn I can see myself as Nick Carraway tho. I tend to be the third-wheel and spectator ~~almost every day of my life~~ Ooh and I’m Leonard from TBBT dont know what that is xd i only watched a little bit of it, but not a lot i know who Bart is tho Same thing with BSC Wedding proposal, a glimpse of a future, and thankfully no wedding book I know Oh right y’all were talking Book 3 concepts xd My bad I skimmed the convo :pleb: Fuel is hella cheap now that less vehicles are on the road And don’t even get me started on the recovering environment (: Quarantine ain’t so bad Factories have stopped being filled with workers and those buildings are the ones pumping stuff into the air Not to mention non essential flights have been grounded so no stuff coming out of those either Well either way, factories and cars both contribute and it would seem that less and less of those are becoming unused Jeez Doge stop being such a cynic and enjoy the breathable air and visable stars 😂 🤷🏻‍♂️ Welp the animals will certainly enjoy it No you couldn’t, not in perfect detail anyway Smog and light pollution mess everything up Okay but Metropolitan ice cream sandwiches Probably Didn’t she already have that hair tho or am I missing something? The game’s code itself Oh I see And yeah Viv, they’re calling out the people who are accessing server binaries, aka the people who know how to access the code and chapter scripts WEEKS before their official release to everyone else It’s against their Terms of Service Yeah I don’t have a high opinion on WEH neither. Looks generic and cheesy Apparently it’s gaining an increasing fanbase. People seem to love it Ask them yourself PB apparently knows more than we give them credit for Nah they never mentioned diamond choices and mods I’m sure they have a long time ago ^ It’s mostly happening on tumblr according to some of the fandom But also here in #future-spoilers Doesn’t stop them from acknowledging that it’s anywhere possible Likely Like how some Storyscape developers managed to find your Storyscape server @azula If they were even legit God knows They apparently outed themselves The Storyscape developers No I’m not I remember very clearly Yes Disney Found it Yes they found out about the mod That’s why some of y’all progress was reversed Yes This was yours Viv Anyway I told you :eyez: I have a vivid memory when it comes to these things Only after Storyscape shut down 😔 I been knew Those were gems @azula lol it’s ok Viv. Tbf, you stopped being active on there WEEKS ahead of Storyscape announcing the shutdown xd I mean no offense but y’all modded had it coming. How else were they supposed to make money and keep making new stories? 😅 We’re lucky the FB moms are keeping Choices going, even it’s for the wrong reasons FB moms didn’t know about Storyscape Both a bad and good thing, Idek which I didn’t stop you then, I’m not stopping you now 🤷🏻‍♂️ iPhone > Android. Idc what y’all say Oof Kinda yeah But I’m still using my iPhone X to this day So Yeah that was sad It kinda did But I live with it Apart from formatting and dark mode which we’re into apparently xd I love dark mode on my iPhone tho. Hella noice looking Emojis are just better looking on iOS (: Cool What product DOESNT shit on its rival in a commercial I get my iPhone wet-ish all the time bc I’m a klutz AND I drop it at least 100 times per month and how the hell is my iPhone battery life still 90% :WTFthonk: Maybe my iPhone is just one of the few lucky ones 🤷🏻‍♂️ All my iPhones have been hand-me-downs from my dad and he takes good care of them so half the responsibility came from him Every time a new model comes out, he gets that one while I get his old one It’s a nice system I’m okay with it I never use earbuds while charging my phone anyway so Old Reliable here has helped me through plenty of loud obnoxious crowds at school and in public Thank god for music in general It literally drowns out the world around me Mostly Owl City, Coldplay, Of Monsters and Men, Avicii, and Lights. Heavily underrated imho so not a lot of people I know, has heard of them Of course you did lmao Oh god I’d rather not be reminded of how that little demon corrupted my childhood XD But eh LMAOOO Nice the worst is yet to come, according to certain countries in a way, we're still on the tip of the iceberg and some idiots in the USA (obviously conservative Republicans because who else) are already considering reopening the country and their selfish asses are protesting out in the streets with their CHILDREN health workers are either continuing their jobs or staging counter protests things are getting more fucked than they were before i'd never joke about something like this if Trump wasnt politicizing the pandemic, his supporters most certainly are they wear their Trump gear and waving American flags while honking from inside their cars nothing but a freak show, we'd actually make a fortune if people paid to watch it by Zoom unfortunately yes Charles Darwin is rolling in his grave as we speak @Ne-Rwby-On ' Rolling in one's grave ' is an idiom to describe an extreme level of shock or an intense level of surprise or shock, and is expressed as the vicarious sentiment of a deceased person. It is a Hyperbole. basically if an important figure was still alive, they'd also be disappointed bunch of selfish, careless, and dangerous clowns i sincerely hope natural selection takes care of the bad seeds Hence why world peace is impossible :LMFAOdead: But life goes on Wuhan ain’t a small town xd It’s a whole ass city But yeah Wack People are too focused on themselves and hating what they don’t understand to worry about the potential danger they’re in Explains the Jewish hatred during the Black Death Dead and buried while the world dances on our grave I’m very certain conservative Republican governors who still haven’t issued a stay-at-home order for their respective states have brainwashed their own civilians into thinking the economy is more important than staying alive. Florida governor called the order “inappropriate.” INAPPROPRIATE HOW?!?! Has Florida’s water got into your system too? Circus freaks But uh MAGA I guess.... Right wingers are a poison It’s like the people who don’t believe in the Holocaust ._. Oy vey California and unfortunately we have conservatives here too protesting Gn Man Scandinavia were supposed to be the good countries of the world My school hasn’t opened since March 16 How spoiled Don’t forget their hair Paige “Massage is essential” :LMFAOdead: Bruh crack your own spine And FLOSS LMAOO “Jesus is my vaccine” Well thoughts and prayers to you :WTFthonk: I’m a catholic but even I can acknowledge that prayer doesn’t fix everything People will do anything for attention “Look at my new tinfoil hat Mommy! Doesn’t it make me look pretty and stupid?” :aww: The human race is facing an exam and half the class are already failing it They think they can take shortcuts but naw ^^ lol XD I just wrapped up exam week last week Yup It varies actually One of my professors actually wants us to use our mics and cams while he uses some type of technology that tells him whether or not we’re looking up the answers Beats the hell out of me Sadly All my exams are timed as well The time limit is pretty generous Do you know how many questions you’re getting Doge? Oof Bro chemistry IS math at times Clearly Good morning yeah i too only ever go outside for school and/or errands and if the occasion should happen, i go out with friends or visit their homes those were the days but im thankful for the free time at home enjoying it while it lasts bc most of them are conservative republicans who care more about profit and the economy than well, keeping their friggin people alive Their MAGA hats are cutting off the blood flow to their brains. They haven’t been able to thoroughly think since 2016 They were tolerable at best even before but even so, they’ve been enabled to become worse But sure, let’s declare golf and haircuts essential services 🤡 I mean come on Las Vegas Throw the old mayor out. Yet another dunce cap wearer thinking closures are “total insanity” during this time Anyway rambled there for a sec, I honestly don’t fully understand the control group thing ‘Merica LMAO You do understand sarcasm right Hyper? :OOF: @Carina welcome! Favorite book and LI?

Not many of us can do enough to help out our local communities. Second of all, why isn’t THAT dude doing anything to help out his local community but has enough time to guilt trip others?

The film stars Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, Amy Poehler and Fey. It is partially based on Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 non-fiction self-help book, Queen Bees and Wannabes, which describes female high school social cliques and the damaging effects they can have on girls. Fey also drew from her own experience at Upper Darby High School as an inspiration for some of the concepts in the film.[3] The movie introduced Amanda Seyfried in her film debut." -Wikipedia Mean Girls is basically every straight girl's and gay guy's inspiration for a sassy personality. cliche high school drama and getting back at the bullies, *while* roasting them or sum. i wouldnt know, i've only ever heard things about it xd IIRC, PB sorta kinda already achieved a Mean Girls type of book with the first 4 TF books, i think this new one may or may not take it to another level xd or basically any one of the books where Becca was still mean guess we'll wait and see No Maralina ;-; Non-night owls can be strong too Imagine wasting away your day sleeping.

Both sides seem pretty reasonable But idk People will be crying socialism or capitalism or whatever tf At this point, I’m just hoping the world is rid of covid forever Obviously not soon based on the disgusting display of natural selection outside government buildings Not to mention the new school year People will do anything to jumpstart the economy again I hope they’re mandatory We have no room for anti-vaxxers and their usual dumbassery Truth Same here Prolly gonna spend my birthday in quarantine too.

It’s something you just can’t ever forget Our fur babies Maybe someday, just not in the next year or two Awie! ☺️ Yeah I figured I might need a year or two to process and grieve For some reason, anytime just feels too soon. I might just wait until I’m financially independent because my parents understandably don’t want another living thing to get emotionally attached to. Pain is just too much They definitely were Yeah and that’s perfectly understandable. At least they’re opening their hearts to more furry souls that need them ian somerhalder still looks hella young tho oh hell yeah 🔥 Cats & Dogs was cute dayum i never even heard of him until i found out he mo-capped for Until Dawn so i thought that was really cool yup! @Andromeda YES!! both Jordan and Rami are gorgeous Brett aint half bad either hehe he also plays a hella relatable gay disaster in a really old show called "The War at Home" i never loved him more as an actor after seeing clips of that show Sean same oh shit dude, stay safe things are just getting worse over there, i'd imagine Good All that were involved should be And not for protection Fr? Shit... Um yeah just because he can *barely* utter clear words, doesn’t mean he can breathe properly Bro he’s getting all butthurt that a social media giant, his preferred megaphone, is fact checking him and it’s beyond hilarious seeing him soil his diaper about it And he has the audacity to think that signing an executive order will do anything to interfere with the 1st amendment-related issue :LMFAOdead: Yeah that was a big no-no And then he makes it political by crying “REEEEE THEY TRYNNA SILENCE THE CONSERVATIVE VOICE” No child, you’re just encouraging more violence Finally twitter gave the clown the biggest slap in the face he needed for the last 4-5 YEARS “Remain accessible” Nah get rid of it completely Honestly it was like a long-needed prayer that had been answered @Deleted User he lost the popular vote back in 2016. Unfortunately, our extremely flawed electoral college system voted him into office, despite not even winning popular vote to begin with It discourages the average American from voting to begin with because ultimately, the outcome could go either way. It renders our vote useless when it goes the opposite way than we wanted it to along with many others in the past serves him right was it ever known what kind of relationship they had tho? most likely they hated each other. why else would he kill him ever so nonchalantly yeah its the last day of May for Viv yup im pretty sure she's ahead of everyone in this server I'm PST oh my goodness i love the icon Viv ya :OOF: but still adorable nonetheless xd saaaaaaaame they're smexy as hell thats such an amazing alternative bench pressing you xD HA! thats great lol :LMFAOdead:  oml *sighs* Greaaaaaaat, first we had zombie ants now zombie fires :WTFthonk: Next up for grand ol 2020, California will finally sink into the ocean thanks to the Big One.

We’re pretty much comfortable where we are, as much as we can be anyway, and I’m still a dependent But believe me when I say, if I could, I would A lot of my old classmates from high school got the fuck out of here ASAP after graduation My town’s police dept is funded by all the rich white people that make up the population so I’m not gonna expect them to quit pandering to them anytime soon Yikes I also got these beauties a few hours earlier Reality is such a lovely place When they place curfew during police brutality riots but not months ago when covid was spreading. Seriously MAKE IT MAKE SENSE sometime during the first week of June yup sounds about right ooh now i know what August is gonna be zombie outbreak they were doing that in my town, but protestors will just end up putting them back again 🤷🏻‍♂️ hopefully even paint it somewhere its like they're embracing their new reputation, not even trying to repair it what law isnt honestly i agree its unfair to treat an entire group like shit bc of the mistake of a few bad apples exactly, some even decided to march with them perhaps we'll see some justice its honestly beautiful to see some white people using their privilege to defend black protestors in some of the videos going viral where was the tear gas when republican conservatives were protesting stay-at-home orders? :WTFthonk: make it make sense oh my, now there's a twist he really doesnt his clownery was confirmed when he threatened to sign some useless executive order to control Twitter just bc they fact-checked his tweets yeah he always tweets out that he'll "do it" but actually doesnt he's all talk and type, but no do yes as i've said before, all he knows are simple small words and nothing else he should stop with the pathetic charade that he'll "get things done" its utterly embarrassing but he wont 🤷🏻‍♂️ #BringBackBernie childhooooooooooood she really is the og abg tho What Altair said, it’s an Asian thing When push comes to shove, search urban dictionary That is awesome Mara 🖤 yeah, as if Discord trusts the person to do the right thing and either turn back or go on ahead now they're cracking down they've been doing that forever after all sounds like a regular every-day American accent to me ye, west coast mainly Midwest maybe as well if you're referring to the stereotypical "valley people" then in some cases, yeah Valley girl is a socioeconomic stereotype depicting a class of women characterized by the colloquial California English dialect Valleyspeak and materialism.

Originally referring to upper-middle-class girls from the Los Angeles commuter communities of the San Fernando Valley during the 1980s,[1] the term in later years became more broadly applied to any female in the United States who embodied ditziness, airheadedness, or greater interest in conspicuous consumption than intellectual or personal accomplishment. -Source Wikipedia kek honestly he sounds like me back in high school .-. i had a mindset where i too wanted to please everyone from literally every clique, i apparently wanted to be part of the "in-crowd" but not really ngl i was a weird high school student. i was so careful about what i would post or retweet and all that jazz just to gain approval. i was toxic in that sort of way yeah true. after graduation, it suddenly but finally hit me. im never seeing some of these popular kids ever again, why tf should i care what they think about me i cleared up my profiles of people i never liked or was never a huge fan of, unfollowed so many peeps that wouldnt even care if i lived or died so yeah i was like BYE!! yeah we really needed a wake-up call it really does honestly HSS was everything i wished high school irl was xd more accepting and shit but there were times where it was all sunshine and rainbows and i was like nah, this is too much they were jealous of you but yeah that too lel lmfao that was a big oof 😳 yeah it really does sound really sleazy ~~oh that bad huh~~ I swear all the time with my friends at school but at home, I gotta make sure that I’m home alone so I can swear over video chat with friends lmao lol yum sleeeeeeeeeep think of Adam Driver sorry im a mess rn, im in the middle of a zoom meeting and im barely paying attention and im saying dumb shit oh ok ily too even tho i dont deserve love atm ;_; oof gl :uwu: oh damn partial reopening #roast-pb for that Logical You people weird me out :eyez: welcome! @yoongles Welcome! @Quell fav book and LI?

> I'm pretty sure all religions want you to be a good person, so it's stupid when people use them as an excuse to be cunts oh yeah NZ is pretty chillin rn @Andromeda yes i loved that @azula Doggos that never die 🤔 Think of it as practice for actual motherhood in the distant future After all, all dogs are bby children You’re doing great Viv i dont know any of these oy vey these days, people within and outside the community think that these people are just coming up with new IDs just for attention but frankly, im uneducated myself so i wouldnt know the whole story its just becoming more confusing to me. they definitely act all self-righteous and start throwing tantrums when we're barely trynna keep up i've definitely read stories and different scenarios, yes you get crucified for minding your own business and/or not taking the time out of your busy schedule to learn these new pronouns and such they're kinda just being extra and making themselves feel more special like personally, im all good with he/him, she/her, and they/them, but thats about it agreed nah im practically in the same boat as you thats a perfect example ngl honestly it just feels like so much effort with the multiple gender pronouns out there, whether coming up with new ones or learning them so i just dont bother mhm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Smith wikipedia came through for Sam Smith i was so happy to see this the website used "they" pronouns" "They rose to prominence in October 2012 after being featured..." eh its much easier to remember tbh i got used to it quickly ^ 2-3 of them caused fires that consumed half of my home state so yeah, i think they're stupid too straight up dumb as long as people dont play with anything explosive or fire hazardous, they can have their parties for all i care it is pretty stereotypical tbh you can have a few measly words printed on it, that should suffice i've grown to not care about surprises. like just straight up tell me and i'll react in an appropriate way. no need for some dramatic pause XDD my parents let me do my own thing. i find myself getting involved in the best of both worlds. i can get engaged in first person shooters AND spill my feelings and emotions thank god, my parents werent hellbent on getting me involved in high school activities, especially stereotypical ones yeah lol 🙌🏼 :WTFthonk: Very understandable Tay NZ is chillin rn Expensive as hell but considered better compared to the Philippines And yeah I hope that rat bastard gets his ass kicked this November In many ways more than one Because hoo-rah for the electoral college, a very dumb system yt men gets to get away with everything 🤡 Tay if this is about your || body issues and image || please don’t okay? Love you for you. Ignore the shitheads who tell you otherwise.

You right, you right And Sean Doge by that logic, literally all Choices LIs in existence is overrated You’d be surprised 😳 I still stand by my statement. So it’s concluded then. By the logic of Doge, Estela is also overrated Compared to other fandoms that are out there, Estela does indeed have more than one fan. Therefore overrated according to you 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yes :reverse: :reverse: Yes :reverse: XDD Jfc you weren’t kidding when you said the healthcare over there sucks That’s just irresponsible and dangerous Yeah I’d imagine @Deleted User welcome! :hawyee: Welcome! @iamgod420 Fav book and LI? The writers are time travelers ~~confirmed~~ nah sorry This is the dumbest shit I’ve ever read Like wtf It’s Vietnamese. Just learn to pronounce correctly if it you feel like pronouncing “fuck” will light you on fire He sounds like a diehard Christian who would burst into flames at the sight of a hetero interracial couple I hope that dipshit gets/got fired That was just unprofessional Also, “Bui” is not even pronounced as “boy.” I should know. I’ve had it mispronounced in front of my face my whole life I’ve heard people call me Andrew “Boy” on purpose just to get a rise out of me So no, it is not “fuckboy” it is simply “Phuc Bui.” Yup And Phuc is something like “foo-k” I have several uncles with that name and my parents pronounce it in such an exotic way I can’t exactly type it so I stuck with that educated guess @Deleted User they just don’t bother trying Let alone ask me first Unless you’re of the same ethnicity, you’ve no right or authority to tell other people how to pronounce their own damn names ^ think we would've remembered that guess we'll wait and see when he wakes up 🤷🏻‍♂️ It was long overdue I dare you to cough on them Doge: Hitman for Hire lel YES uwu how are you just now realizing this Doge? smh hmm uwu Shhh don’t question it uwu Aww doge got it uwu Hell yeah f We been knew woah sounds like a lot of work but at the same time.. ah mmkay "this spit belongs to a famous person" 😳 hi No me 🗿 Furi is taking a break 🤔 but he got promoshun this is literally Kyo in the heat of the moment https://tenor.com/view/press-f-pay-respect-keyboard-gif-12855017 dream crushers man.... https://tenor.com/view/jon-stewart-eat-eating-popcorn-watching-gif-5102037 That’s what’s happening here But why is his face towards the end a mood?? Yeah why? @azula ^is that the one? Ooh I’ve never seen it but that’s actually really cool. A tv show really took place somewhere that’s 24 minutes away from my house Wack Whoops they left @azula im hearing from other people that she was blackfacing/ doing things unintentionally racist in past videos like at least she acknowledged it AND didn’t brush it off like most youtube apologies end up being 2020 cancel culture is becoming trendy apparently 2020, the year where people think that they might die so lets just cancel everybody like from what I’ve seen jenna did something actually good and *acknowledged* the fact that she started her channel on a wrong spot instead of the “it’s in the past, let’s move on” kinda excuse exactly @Deleted User this should be in #multimedia-shabang Compared to Witness, obviously Good She lowkey looks like a Karen tho @azula No POC Ian, whoops Nope I remember only seeing Asian, Hispanic, and Caucasian But no black Ian Oh Hmm I keep associating only black with POC my bad Really need to break that habit It really is They’re too easily confuzzled so that’s why they feel the need to lob them into categories and groups “To make it easier to tell the difference” Ooh Pink Panther Very old timey No surprise hints of racism were in it Wow Some Christians are wack Like they need to stop shoving their stuff down people’s throats I’m wondering if PB did that intentionally xd Just for shits and giggles ~~Inb4 half of the fandom start calling them MILFs~~ Rae sounds very concerned with you Kyo XDD Like more concern than usual lel :OOF: :ethink: :ethink: she's a persistent little creep aint she even during quarantine, people be filling up the freeways 🤡 Dunno why but I’m just patiently waiting for PB to post their annual Pride Month post and it’s almost the end of June Back on that spam call stuff again?

We should’ve gotten a third It Lives instead of TRM back in October imho Rose Waverley was a crazy bitch And Cordonia is indeed invalid Too many galas :considering: I think so, unfortunately Same with several MW writers Hero is delayed simply bc of art budget issues It’s sad tho bc MW was one of the first books when Choices made its first debut A shame the majority of fans prefer romance fluff and slice-of-life over good old fashioned cop mystery I STILL WANNA KNOW WHO BEHEADED HAYLEY TULL 👀 But god I just want a MW2 already. I need more Sam and Dave OMFG COD My childhood days of playing that on my first iPad ;_; Cause of Death was *chef’s kiss* A lot of newcomers don’t know that several PB employees were former workers for EA on their SHS and COD apps @Deleted User dont worry about him. its his fun little persona on this server, we love him for that xd bite me :eyez: jkjk ily @Deleted User ANYWAY SHS is EA's other mobile app besides COD its Surviving High School and its more slice-of-life compared to Cause of Death which is all about crime thrillers @Deleted User have you played HSS the app? ah ok nvm then the lore i was about to explain could be better understood if we both knew the connection between SHS and HSS xd although there is SOME lore i can connect with Choices and COD i recently just found out that the company Mansingh Transglobal is mentioned in both Choices and COD yup iirc Natara had a relative who worked there and Blaire Hall happens to be the CEO oh right sorry my bad yes her dad is the president of the company its been way too long ;_; sadly EA removed it a long long time ago also my big dumb was showing again Blaire Hall isnt the CEO wikia just says she simply "works there" yeah xd idk its been a while since ive played both ROE and COD ;-; but ye same universe, same connection 👀 still mind-blowing that some PB employees were with EA while working on COD and SHS, the OG visual novel apps if i didnt know any better, id say MW was supposed to pay homage to COD “Allergic to WiFi” :WTFthonk: Yes I know it’s just a film title but like wot XD Hey, the only foreign film I approve of is Train to Busan And prolly Neerja bc that shit was sad and intense I don’t normally watch a terrorist focused film but damn it was good and yes I did!

ES god tier 👌🏼 Noice Rusty was middle aged when I first got him I don’t blame her. Her momma died. This is why dogs are the best. They show love and emotion, during moments where it’s appropriate Even pets grieve It just sucks ^ Animals form an attachment with their humans’ belongings because it contains their scent > She only ever gets up when she sees my mom (aunts sister) because they look alike :(

God I can read this over and over again and it’s still shattering my heart We don’t deserve dogs my parents share the same mentality. after Rusty passed away, they dont want to be attached to another pet ever again me, on the other hand, i want to be a dog owner again someday but i just need time to process and grieve and sort out my shit alongside the pandemic i prefer to be financially stable before giving my love to another fur baby that needs it ^^ they left the server... XD My parents used to give me so much shit about being barely able to take care of myself growing up so “I would be out of my mind to have a dog.” And surprise surprise, my mom brings one home. She fell in love with him, I fell in love with him, my brother did too, and my very stubborn grumpy dad eventually caved in and treated him like a third son Watching an Asian dad fall slowly in love with a dog is like watching character development on a screen oH oK wE’rE sTiLl dOiNg tHiS just breathin @Greenberry sadly no and it fucking sucks oh god, best of luck i mean it is a swedish company you're gonna get very ethnic sounding product names sorry edited that to make sense 🤷🏻‍♂️ bottom line, its not weird per se, its just swedish Might need a little more context Viv XD Happy birthday! @Water Puppies kek Nice one Priya 🤣😈 they make for good diamond mines 👌🏼 btw welcome! @вера cool oof Oh god on your birthday? 💀 well either way 🇫 y'all i just realized, my birthday this year will be on a monday and if god forbid Wetness is somehow still releasing chapters, im gonna be getting a Wetness chapter on my birthday its going to be iirc thats one positive PB is borrowing ideas from other apps yes, in terms of rewards they're already doing that one diamond/ad you didnt notice? its always been like that lol Doge for me, i need 400 minimum just to replay a whole book i never spent diamonds on Wetness is hella easy to mine and VOS god tier i mean i never read books word for word that i dont like, i just *tap tap tap* #multimedia-shabang Me not knowing any swears in viet but the minute I try to swear in English, my parents act like I committed murder Ok but even in the context of British insulting, “mad” just sounds like child’s play lmao ~~Can you get a man to whisper that into my ear?~~ It’s the accent that makes it sound so fancy schmancy Like a British man could try and insult me, and I’ll just be like That’s why I don’t bother :aww: Saaaaaaame XD Ew never mention that name in this Christian server ^ The only valid insult Mara get the VC squad role or perish Reeeee @azula I’ve literally never heard of such a thing I shower every day and I’m still fine.

XD REEEEEEEEEEEE Aight fine, peer pressure it is then O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? And here comes my family’s country’s national anthem Này thanh niên ơi! Tiến lên đến ngày giải phóng.
Đồng lòng cùng đi đi đi mở đường khai lối.
Vì non sông nước xưa truyền muôn năm chớ quên.
Nào anh em Bắc Nam cùng nhau ta kết đoàn.
Hồn thanh xuân như gương trong sáng.
Đừng tiếc máu nóng tài xỉn ráng.
Thời khó thế khó khó làm yếu ta.
Dầu muôn chông gai vững lòng chi sá.
Đường mới kiếp phóng mắt nhìn xa bốn phương.
Tung cánh hồn thiếu niên ai đó can trường.
Thanh niên ơi! Ta quyết đi đến cùng.

Thanh niên ơi! Ta nguyền đem hết lòng.

Chớ quên rằng ta là giống Lạc Hồng. ✌🏼 I mean yeah kinda xddd My dad is big on South Vietnam patriotism, back when that part of Vietnam wasn’t communist And yeah, China’s becoming a bigger mess than it already is :0 That’s awesome lol Wait but why :WTFthonk: Shksshjaahhagdhdjsjsa Bruh Not August yet for my timezone so no insider yet either But nah, we get a recycled custody battle plot in Book 3 of TRH 🤮 And maybe a male MC 🤔 :uwu: welcome! @mango.exe fav book and LI? welcome! @Missfit 😄 favorite book and LI? cool ~~Why would you post this gif in the same context as the discussion of eating fish~~ :pleb: :mmYea: @Missfit you SPEAK 😄 :aww: yes iirc thats what i'd like to know I do not want to be alive if The royal Heir: Teenage years, The royal corgi weddings, or even The royal grandkids exist none are my cup of tea. release schedule is dry imho but y'all can enjoy whatever it truly is the epitome of a high school book, something i just cant relate to anymore, and worst of all, its heteronormative 🗿 :pleb: Yeah today is August 3. With any luck, Insider might come at the end of the week lets do this hbd I’m feeling average As per usual Tis my birthday month but eh Thank :uwu: oh my god religion isnt for everyone but you're in my prayers, sorry to hear Viv Kyo’s right. An extrovert would be bored to death during quarantine. If you’re introverted like about half of us, there’s plenty to do Like Kyo said, find new and/or old hobbies to be invested in Oh god, only the first three years of high school Random ass things gained clout during that era The clown sightings throughout the USA Oh and the water bottle flipping! My classmates would constantly be doing that during lunch A bottle flipping kid really got onto the Ellen show because of it lmao Cool Was it on or off? Virtually impossible depending on the speed XD Ah teachers, they either go along with the trendy activities or put a stop to them lel O my god and the trending video games XD Pokémon Go, Fortnite and PUBG Even the non gaming popular kids were so into PG Oh man those were the shit my best school experiences were 8th grade (last year of middle school) and 9th grade (first year of high school). everything always seemed easygoing during those 8th grade bc i got to fly to Washington DC for a field trip with some of my class and 9th grade bc i was introduced to the world of online gaming and the online friends that came with it yeah mine neither ~~prolly bc elementary school was when i started getting into trouble for repeating cuss words that i had just learned ~~ i blame my dad for buying me the Uncharted game when i was still in the friggin 4th grade XD XD that game was riddled with cussing oof couldnt relate. my dumbass child self repeated them when i got angry or frustrated with something at school doing a hard math problem and getting it wrong = **Son of a bitch** ~~he did actually~~ needless to say, i was sent to the principal's office multiple times that year xd Fingers crossed Viv🤞🏼 @🥚 𝕆𝕟𝕚𝕖𝕘𝕘𝕠 🥚 welcome!

In the USA, that would be considered non-essential services Oh I’m dumb My bad @Andromeda wow Jake’s ego is more infectious than covid. The implication that he thinks he’s smarter than people with an actual education and he thinks everyone wants to be an influencer :WTFthonk: People are more worried about not being able to work and it’s just heartbreaking that we can’t even cancel rent and payment deadlines during a crisis like this Young people thinking they’re god... Hang in there Viv Pregpreg god im so sorry for your loss Viv she's in a good place now, she wont suffer or struggle anymore welcome! @Mione13 fav book and LI? and it was squandered ATV was way too romance focused than actual sci-fi stuff ^ IKR anyway liberty for bots Embrace it gross BOTS.

XDDD i too am a gay male choices player and will only get emotionally invested in non-genderlocked books lol uwu M4M romance routes good and so are non-romance genres (: ye bb's lore is pretty extensive you never really know tho i dont think Cleopatra ever mentioned a cousin named Kamilah in ACOR xd sadly true 😬 braidwood manor would make for a decent arena xD ooh noice facts i mean :uwu: and :dopeywhat: :dopeystarey: :dopeyoop: :dopeyangry: :diamond: :ally: :ame_flirty: :romance: @kyo same lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ugh school doesnt even feel like it should matter rn :hawyee: night! those birds sound like meanies Was it really that hot?

Yeah that would actually suck tbh yes #choices-chat same hat @Deleted User right on time join the Roast Royals session Ah TE good And asexuals Man whether it’s Slovakia or Russia, anywhere east of Western Europe is just...backwards Oh really? @вера @вера I see Yikes Emphasis on “somewhat” I imagine @вера https://twitter.com/queerty/status/1291619591341318144?s=21 Yeah it’s just really shitty As per usual Honestly any pride in Eastern Europe that isn’t met with homophobic counter protestors is a successful one She gives off Kaitlin Bennett vibes, gross She probably would Has the conservatism and bigotry for it Russia is such a stereotype all by itself it’s even being associated with non Russian aspects They think being associated with Russia on the internet makes them edgy Like it’s the holy land :WTFthonk: There’s really nothing to idolize other than the ridiculously large land size It’s geography may be friggin huge but they don’t have their shit together entirely Edginess is just being blind. They think they’re retrofitted for Russia’s lifestyle but nah I actually couldn’t agree with you more. Half of us are dumb af ATLA is a good tv show and Pacific Rim isn’t too shabby of a movie 👌🏼 Also sorry to hear Furi Friends can become complicated once conflicting politics and social issues weasels its way into it my brain stopped at one and half-assed Spanish and Vietnamese growing up also i could never ever play my voice on video bc i end up wanting to rip my own vocal chords out whenever i listen to my recorded voice its so HIDEOUS but i wont hesitate to speak on VC Hola y'all should hear me speak Vietglish to my parents, its somewhat comedy gold xd does anyone here know sign language, if any at all? i find it much cooler than any spoken language tbh tho i must confess, i took a whole semester of it and forgot it all completely XDD but its still very fasincating yeah because there's American Sign Language, Japanese Sign Language, etc etc yup its really cool British Sign Language (BSL), Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language
French Sign Language (FSL)
American Sign Language (ASL) deaf community really created its own culture in modern history and its really amazing i learned it for college credit xd LEAVE ME ALONE I still loved learning it tho XD 🙄 Hey I’ll have you know The deaf community does not consider themselves misfortuned They consider themselves a blessing uwu They deserve everything good in the world :uwu: ~~did i not just listen to a recording of your voice?~~ i know i've been warned by my ASL professor that anyone can become hard of hearing overtime if we keep up extreme activities like listening to loud music on headphones oof obvi ew who willingly listens to Jake Paul talk to begin with i actually dunno who that is xd :OOF: Sounds like blatant juvenile behavior Bringing back a substitute for the American 1950s “panty raid” college pranks that used to occur Yeah lemme reconfirm that that was the 1950s College boys back in those days were nothing but childish freak shows. These days they just become worse by joining frats and taking part in dangerous life-threatening hazing. Stealing women’s clothing today just makes you a pervert, it doesn’t make you edgy or cool welcome! @Deleted User fav book and LI? IL god tier RCD is meh, it kinda gets worse by Book 3 and not just because its a wedding book HSS good too personally i prefer THM over WT welcome! @unhinjed fav book and LI? oops there they go yup dunno why but sometimes newcomers leave the minute one of us pings them with a welcome XD yeah well.... :hawyee: its not only me you know lmao yeah... lol i dont remember correctly, but it was either Altair or somebody else who suggested that would be the protocol whenever someone new does enter "welcome (ping someone's name here) then ask about their favorite book and LI" idk anymore no kidding Welcome! @Emma🧁 what up fool :hawyee: what is life? https://tenor.com/view/hiding-under-covers-tired-sleepy-hiding-under-blanket-good-night-gif-13568050 or just hide back under the covers about 2:52 PM here so im wide awake obvi PM and IL god tier Choices potential and quality were indeed at its peak during the times PM and IL were releasing male MCs here and there, non romance genres, all that jazz now its just gross heteronormative smut VOS era was amazing literally just ended a few weeks ago so yeah hella dry stop :mmNo: :mmYea: yuuuuuuuuuuuuup :considering: and OH2 remains on hiatus until September F only gender-unlocked book thats "updating" book 1 was so good, book 2 was a big mess good but also mess true i tolerate it more than the rest of the schedule rn, thats for sure could do with less Ethan periodt mine is Bryce uwu they really did all the non-Ethan LIs dirty sidelined all the non-Ethan characters completely at least in book 1, the roommates also got more of the spotlight just ... he was def forced almost || rape-y || eh i think both are equally forced Doge you mean QB Ina is from QB lmao god Doge you really are sleepy lol im barely reading them but even ik which forced LI was from which book xd || rape-y || Hello :redfield: btw how am I just now realizing we got this emote jasksjjsjs im so slow :redfield: uwu Redfield @Deleted User welcome to the discord side of the Choices fandom! I wouldn’t say tumblr is “savage” more like toxic but that’s just my opinion I personally find the discord fandom more of a breath of fresh air compared to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook :heresthemf:  @Deleted User @Deleted User Instagram are a bunch of simps True Priya From THM An antagonist You should play it soon if you can It’s really good Very good Probably when they get to The Royal Grandparents :considering: Ugh I hate the Royal series because of TRH dammit pri I was gonna bring out Uberbot smh There’s just too much of that fluff Oh boy i love all the woods characters ;-; i dont have the heart to let anyone die sksksksksksksksksksksksksk it would be this one ig if you ask me, i think you did the right thing. it showed your "friends'" true colors. Nazism is seriously nothing to joke about and behind that word is a very shitty past. if anyone thinks anti-Semitism or the Nazi salute/symbol is something to joke about harmlessly without it meaning anything, then clearly they have paid jackshit attention in history class. "cant take a joke" is irrelevant. you're willingly throwing out these gestures and words that you may or may not know the true meaning behind and YET you have the audacity to justify it as joking around. its insensitive, childish, juvenile, and to a certain group, traumatizing and cruel well thats very unfortunate but typical excusing behavior when it doesnt deserve excusing to begin with ugh that shouldnt be how friends work at all you dont make excuses for their behavior just to be on their good side no, you educate them and if they still refuse to listen to reason, drop them quick wave goodbye sayonara blind loyalty is a real issue to this day, it brings so much toxicity to the table, and people suffer in silence while letting others get away with their shitty behavior wdym? oh i see yeesh Noice PM, TE, and BOLAS are all good No, September @azula quelle surprise :/ Because PB is running out of ideas... Here’s to another year with hopefully little to no more female genderlocked books, MW2, Hero2, IL3, etc but of course, wishful thinking on my part as long as there's less smut and generic romance, i dont mind welcome! @Deleted User The saying I don’t really care much for the book lets see, the oldest message was from Viv sent on 5/19/2018 about two years, give or take damn this server was just starting out when i finished my senior year of high school about a month before i graduated Damn and I figured out the date without having to use commands Mainly because I used the search feature by putting in “from Viv” and then clicked “Oldest” in general Lel You often need handholding I’ve heard of her Yay :aww: 🥳 Ngl tho, I’d be in your position as well if I owned a big discord server. I’d need help from others constantly as well. I don’t know diddely squat about computers but I know enough to download my favorite games and turn in my online homework xd Oh I see Sorry I didn’t know :uwu: But yeah, technology overall is wack And that’s why we have #tech-channel :pleb: @azula yes I have flat feet, more or less :pleb: Yes I mean my family don’t talk about feet sizes so I’m assuming it’s normal enough to not discuss about it at family gatherings 👀 My family lineage is kinda boring. We’re all 100% Vietnamese, no diversity whatsoever We apparently stayed in our Vietnamese lane :WTFthonk: Perhaps That is true. It’s not a shock that there were cross breeding during those war-torn times :pleb: They definitely were with all them guerrilla warfare and tunnels and traps 🤣 ~~Yt people being left out for once~~ Oh yes some are extremely gnarly But this is the stuff of nightmares Eh I’m on my phone, dunno how Makes me shudder just thinking about it And my dad fought on the south’s side so I couldn’t even begin to imagine what he went through Ye, he’s gone through so much to try and fight the communism movement He’s 68 And im turning 20 in a few days So you can pretty much piece together his situation Oh yeah, very 55 Decent age gap Rip my parents’ 13 year gap Oh man ): :pleb: @Andromeda ugh that plus they're Asian so they agree on little to nothing apart from when they're ganging up on me one is older and grouchier and more hotheaded and the other is somewhat timid but stands her ground but makes things worse with her banshee-like voice declaring screaming matches against each other is like their hobby but overall, the age gap is pretty obvious just by me hearing their conversations @Missfit yeah I’m fine. I just went on a somewhat triggered rant there for a sec. I killed the mood but I’m over it now @OctoberSky welcome! 😄 noice, very noice :mmYea: mayhaps 👀 hey, i say mayhaps bc im unoriginal and im a trend-follower XDD its a combo of "maybe" and "perhaps" how could you not find that appealing 😉 https://tenor.com/view/noice-brooklyn-ninenine-b99-smile-gif-11928987 Hello Welcome! @Elijah Fav book and LI? (: #announced-books It’s a long story-ish I think so yeah I got that vibe Idk, I just feel like inclusion and awareness are both equally important But maybe that’s just me 🤷🏻‍♂️ At this point, I would love to see non binaries since they’re practically non existent as MCs You forgot about Andy Hashtag fact I would love to see PB say “Eff u” to the homophobic moms one of these days and just release an all-out LGBTQ+ culture book, which addresses drag queens, non binaries, transgenders, and different pronouns God imagine RuPaul being put into Choices as a character like PB did with Lea Michele in Hollywood U Man it hurts/feels good to dream Yuuuuuuuuuuuup https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lea_Michele Yeah she bad Lea Michele is, yes Imho looks aren’t everything It’s what the inside that counts And Lea’s inside is worse than Chernobyl @azula it usually depends on their personality. The ones that I know have been straightforward and chillin. They keep mostly to themselves 🤔 Actually when it comes to talking about my ethnicity, it’s a pretty legitimate question We have our own way of life That’s why I said it depends on their personality Straight Viet boys are told the same thing all the time at family reunions, (even me before I came out): “when are you gonna get a girlfriend? And when you do, treat her like a princess, by any means necessary.” I might just be exaggerating but my straight male cousins always have to plaster on a smile when they get told that by relatives https://tenor.com/view/simp-simpin-simpin-over-pussy-spongebob-gif-18105323 They really just assumed your gender Viv :WTFthonk: This is not what your distant aunt and uncle meant when they said to treat them like a princess  hetero viets 😂 Yeah why? Kk 👍🏼 :pleb: Hehe @oge should we do it then? 😉 yes @Water Puppies relax, he'll murder me and Doge in our sleep, not you Viv :mmYea: ~~and maybe i want him to sneak into my bedroom at night~~ @Water Puppies notice me uwu .ud lobotomite apparently so uwu did you see the video Viv wanted to tag you in? lol sweet 20 soon, birthday buddy 😳 :aww: @Will Ferrell welcome and I love your username sad but true they're either asleep or left a long time ago or simply inactive Can @Purplesim and I...uh...have some birthday roles?

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.[1] Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.[2] These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash.[1][2] Recovery generally takes two to seven days.[1] In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.[1][2] @oge #choices-chat Fuck 2020 indeed Diss post? Yeah she has a rep on the Wikia site Heard she bans people for no reason off that site and makes false accusations Man this server hasn’t talked shit about Fearless Diva in forever and now it has resurfaced She’s just a control freak period She’s like the Homeowner’s Association in America.

It’s pretty forgettable Kind of Depends on what school you want to go to Some unis are picky about the standardized test scores you’ve had in the past Others don’t care at all Damn indigenous instruments and traditional folk dances Y’all foreign cultures are wack Jkjk But only that aspect I mean I voluntarily wanted to play the trombone back in elementary school because I was trying new things but then I got bored after a year and never tried any other extracurricular activity ever again lmao Ugh I can never ever dance in public That ain’t it chief It’s called Áo Dài and you’d only wear this on Vietnamese Lunar New Year, aka Tết Full view for both genders. Gotta love how the women look so happy and confident while the men look stiff as a board ~~But I actually did feel stiff growing up, idk why, I didn’t like wearing mine~~ ugh sorry, my dad is making run an errand rn literally just walked in to tell me right after you pinged me smh I’m glad to see that you love it now tho after yesterday’s session @azula you and your boyfriend should do this cosplay for Halloween 😂 XD darn oh god not that again :jebus: white people will come up with the darndest things https://tenor.com/view/fairly-odd-parents-trixie-tang-timmy-turner-pretty-crush-gif-4530310 :pleb: no he left i stan Hilda the Doggo she made Mr. Red go away she's always worth it Elliot is baby who must be protected :lgbt_heart_sparkly: omg yes some stories had more than one sibling would it be easier to only do the books with only one sibling? i would think so tbh roe had three i can already imagine a hypothetical cousin poll: Violet (ROE) or Nadia (PM) lel :heresthemf: doggos are prepping for battle in all honesty, i expected Furball to be in the automatic lead Furball and the Arylu are the only non-doggos in the poll 🤔 heh i love all the doggos i love Pomeranians even more i just didnt like TRM i feel like the Pomeranian breed couldve been featured in a better book but idk, im weird Threep ftw not a huge cat person irl but Threep is something different xd thats what makes me love him lol he's the epitome of the average cat's personality but the only other cat in multimedia that i stan is Salem from "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" Salem would kick Threep's ass i would think https://tenor.com/view/cat-halloween-witches-sorciere-gif-6583375 :heresthemf: :aww: :hawyee: @VVUser8 if you’re on mobile, just tap on Invite And then this If you’re on PC, it should look similar-ish https://tenor.com/view/halloween-happy-skeleton-dance-gif-15937345 > Let's all honor our loved ones who have crossed to the other side ❤️

Facts. Schedule has been dry af lately. Decision making barely has any effect on the story anymore and the MCs usually have no say in the matter. God I miss 2018 Choices. Back when you could choose your MC’s gender and make decisions that actually had an impact on the story I haven’t genuinely enjoyed a book since BOLAS and DS ended There used to be one and it was called Storyscape :hawyee: Now THAT was a good Choices alternative welcome! fav book and LI? cool huh? nope im not on there much ah he kinda does tho lol how ambitious of you and no not technically... just as long as you dont take it too far political talks go into #current-events-talk just fyi grab some #roles and you'll gain access to more private channels and, well, roles well your profile still says "No Roles" for this server ~~i'd make a terrible staff member, good thing im not one~~ #multimedia-shabang for games other than Choices 👍🏼 You could’ve pinged Benji for that question lmao Ah @Deleted User My family is from Vietnam but I was born and raised in the USA Pretty much But even before the pandemic, they don’t always lead you to success right off the bat The job market and economy is hella complex and even with a uni education, it was hard Usually the ones to do with corporate affairs, technology based, etc Oh and being a simple business owner/entrepreneur It depends on how skilled you are I’m not too knowledgeable on those, sorry Oh god > @DaHomieDrew bruh, I'm taking IT at high school
@Deleted User  impressive Ugh racial discrimination will never end. Hispanic discrimination has intensified in the last four years and asian discrimination intensified since the pandemic began It’s mostly the white American racists, yes They don’t have the mental capacity to see past skin color They’re stuck in their own little shitty world where “white is surpreme” Imagine white people thinking they know the different types of Asians :mmNo: No Karen and Kevin, just stop trying You don’t know shit @azula ~~I’m not entirely sure tbh~~ mayhaps? We’re just so diverse even I myself can’t tell so I just keep my mouth shut because I don’t know a whole lot myself Ice cream lol #tech-channel for that Check the pinned messages :WTFthonk: What happened? Tell the story! :marafrogemoji: All over a broken window Rich people really do be like that, a pain in our asses Yeah this definitely is considered low priority in the eyes of the American law Hopefully Filipino law sees it the same way O Hmm I mean even rich criminals have actually been given the proper sentence and so like hopefully she’s just bluffing This entire situation is just dumb Oh shit The sad reacts tho Um Well Someone gifted me nitro for a month So like :dogeheart: I finally know what it feels like to be a rich discord user :glasses: :BooParty: Do discord servers have limited numbers of emotes?

I think I remember seeing you here before Oop Meh I dont mind cleaning up after a dog. It’s just as equally disgusting and a chore as cleaning out a litter box and I’ve done both But Viv is right. Dogs get easily attached to you. Cats make you work for their approval 🤣 Good morning > I have my ways
@Rayvenrock  wdym you have your ways? It was in the November newsletter, which everyone can sign up for :dogekek: Not so high and mighty now are ya? :mmYea: :marafrogemoji: > I mean, if you have money, why not show it?
Because not only are you showing off your privilege, you’re being a complete asshat about it. I don’t care for the intentions, you’re just making everyone around you feel bad about themselves. There are people out there in the world who would do anything for a simple ROOF over their heads, or even clean water, or decent clothes. Rich people can buy all they want just so long as they don’t shove it in my face and flaunt it in front of the unfortunate’s faces I never said you couldn’t I’m not forcing you to do anything Just don’t be a complete douche about it I feel strongly about this because my parents raised me in a way that I should always count my blessings. They grew up in Vietnam during the war. My dad came from a wealthy family and my mom was middle class but even they know firsthand how the less fortunate live, especially when they immigrated to America. They started out with nothing and now they managed to scrape together enough so that I can live in a nice middle class neighborhood with a functional roof over my head, go to a good school, and well, have a decent life! I don’t ask for much and I prefer it that way. I’m grateful for what I got, not for what I want. I hate it when people do that They make countries great Me neither I’ve ridden a bike with my uncle on the streets of Vietnam and I can tolerate that Gimme a simple four door car that’ll get me from Point A to Point B any day Money for transitioning I can understand but everything else, be thankful for what you have. But if you want more, go for it. Just be mindful of those around you Lmao Nope 😂 Stay safe Viv Very American indeed tho lol Yes actually Three The standard two guys and one girl Avoid the Best Man at all costs But you get to decide for yourself if you like the || “from enemies to lovers” || trope cause that’s pretty much what Justin is all about No the Best Man It’s aight Nah actually, one is your childhood friend and the other is a dressmaker iirc There were 7 I think Godspeed Viv 👀 STD LI lmao ye the acronym is roastable had such a small role and yet she lowkey epic lol :flushedfisheye: you dont like him bc he resembles you lmao hehe me neither self esteem XD BOLAS is just that good :mmYea: :kek: hmm dont forget DS 👍🏼 :uwuhappy: :uwu: No it’s not, I don’t think....? So long as you’re not saying shit like ||tranny|| or calling the person their opposite gender Because those gestures are worse imho Yeah it all depends on the person. I know a lesbian and a gay guy who’s perfectly fine with her calling him a ||fag|| it’s kinda wack to me but who am I to judge. He doesn’t take offense and she knows Idk maybe I’m wrong and I’m looking at it differently If someone can reassure/re-educate me, that’d be fine because i still don’t know anything Yeah I figured that much @KaiaLou ignore my dumb shit Yeah thanks for the heads up and for the info Sorry if I caused any discomfort Spiders are indeed the epitome of pure evil But yeah I still have a long ways to go to learn the fine line between harmless in-good-fun joking and blatant disrespect It’s a wee bit privileged to say the least but like at the same time, it could also be considered in good fun? Idk, I took the school bus every day in high school and even I joke that I’m a peasant for not getting my license early like everyone else my age at the time Classist would prolly be revving your sports car in a poor neighborhood like Viv talked about earlier in this channel or throwing away your AirPods just because they stopped working instead of properly disposing of them Eh Idek anymore I mean personally I think they’re not all bad and they can be convenient for those who can’t afford to own cars Yeah public transportation can be a schedule nightmare but some people manage Well as an introvert, I do very much prefer to be in a vehicle by myself with no one else around while I blast my favorite music out loud. It’s so therapeutic, especially when there’s no one to judge my music tastes lmao I’m thankful for the fact that my dad is retired so he lets me borrow his car to run errands or hang out with friends (before the pandemic of course.) I’m so glad I got my license way before all that shit went down I felt that in high school lol I was so jealous of all my classmates Yeah the USA is very chillin about letting 16 year olds drive But like still with strict laws Eh not really, not the written portion anyway. The written test was hell for me I hated every minute of it The questions barely made any sense Oh yikes I myself took an hours-long online course, had to have some practice hours with a licensed professional, then more with my parent, and then written portion. And finally, my actual driving test with a DMV employee. Luckily mine was a very young woman who was friendly and easygoing and I passed my very first time with only three mistakes The day I passed, god I was practically over the moon You better hope you don’t get older people. They’re grumpy and very strict with what you have to do xd At least with my friends’ experiences The older instructors are very rude sometimes and hold you to ridiculous expectations I was lucky enough to have someone who legit looked close to my age I myself had to drive around a low income suburban neighborhood so there were a lot of hazards Occasionally I went out on the more busier streets in commercial and business districts to make it more of a challenge but I never had to do the freeway on the test. Just some lane changing on the local roads, parallel parking, all that jazz There were a lot of stop sign intersections tho, holy moly Oh damn, American driving tests are NOT that extensive xd It was only checking the mirrors, looking over the shoulder and hand positioning on the wheel for me But nothing too extra other than that Oof mine was “more than three mistakes and you failed but three or less means you passed” Yea kinda I was lucky enough to only have made three mistakes She literally told me “You passed.” And I wanted to scream happily right there and then :Dopeyhappy: You’re good lol :marafrogemoji: I mean they’re common names No name is exclusive to Choices Lel ah yes, rain while on a bus. i lowkey miss that vibe well personally, i love the rain more if im inside. when im outside and its falling hard, its not too pleasant being outside while drizzling or light rain = therapeutic but thats just me Happy Friday the 13th everyone from the Pacific Time Zone 😈 https://tenor.com/view/friday-mask-killer-skip-hop-dancing-gif-7552528 Same @KaiaLou good luck! I might not be a car enthusiast, but speaking as someone who shares a Toyota with his dad, I can say the brand is trustworthy Yikes What a douche-y move Civilization video game franchise https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series) *doge* Does Uberbot not respond to asterisks? Smh Wait _ works too? _what the fuck_ Wack How did I not know this sooner Me neither :flushedfisheye: You really just said “my head” twice Smh Yeah but not in the same message *doge* Smh Nah :nou: Average, hbu? im excited for a new diamond mine at least Also lowkey the new discord update is tripping me out. But I’ll get used to it eventually Facebook has a similar look when replying to a specific person’s comment, same connecting line and everything maybe you havent updated Discord yet. i updated both on my PC and my phone oh wait no you dont quote it you reply test there it is sjksjjkajjkas there it is hmm so its no longer called quote just reply :pleb: Ree Viv was more referring to race and features, not gender ~~Inb4 they look like Bartie~~ More scandalous scenarios lmao If we got to choose the race With the female Mayor Dixon, who knows Ugh I just wanna see a family fluff story with gay dads for once. We haven’t seen any more portrayals since Maria’s parents from HSS I think we can all agree we hate Clit lmao Even Maralina has admitted to being emotionally traumatized by his stalker-ish motives OH HELL NAWWWWWW :jebus: sjdkdlfjglrlrl If you’re unable do it, then I will. Sure I won’t be able to show the diamond scenes but I’ll step in if you and your mental health need protecting :dogeheart: True... ye, its not even called "quote" anymore, just simply "reply" xd No u :jebus: I’m honestly tired of Cordonia so like I could do without the apple obsession for one lifetime But god almighty I hope TRH3 is the final conclusion If there’s a spin-off about Royal grandparents, I’m ||throwing myself onto a sword|| Nope Mhm same hat HP eh i hear both boat and hat in this server xd its hard keeping up with the youngsters :hawyee: ~~oh wait im a youngster~~ 👀 Oh right, Kyo is the son :marafrogemoji: we still do tbh especially here in California Californian motorists think the turn signal is a mere accessory and it baffles me how anyone could NOT use it, especially on the freeway when changing lanes their excuse? "cant let anyone know my next move" tf does that mean :marafrogemoji: Ok but we have way too many people here. You couldn’t possibly be “followed or stalked” without any eyewitnesses around Still a dumb excuse Or people are just too immature/stubborn and need to grow up and start using their turn signals so that way, more lives can be saved I’m not risking an anxiety attack on the freeway all because some asshat wants to be slick and cut me off just because they can All jokes aside, it’s usually more white people who are driving erratically on the freeway I usually end up giving them the finger and secretly hope they see It’s Family Guy, try not to take it too seriously xd I’m an Asian driver and I’ve considered myself to be very cautious and aware of my surroundings and I’ve been driving for 2-3 years now or so Yeah overall, driving by myself is just so therapeutic while doing it safely Being mindful of others on the road all the while enjoying your own company with no one else trying to backseat-drive you or criticize your music tastes lol @KaiaLou got plans? lol :marafrogemoji: :flushedfisheye: Imposter https://tenor.com/view/emergency-meeting-among-us-meeting-discuss-gif-18383222 I literally sung that in my head just now :FrogVroom: :RGBthinking: Hehe Actually I didn’t pay for nitro A friend gifted it to me I only have it until the end of the month :sadbear: It’s so amazing :thanos: It brings about world peace :stickbugged: :thinkspin: lol it’s been Corn.

That’s just usual men behavior Particularly of the cishet variety I’m one of the few left in the world (tho I’m gay lmao) that actually keeps it in my mouth and swallows it whenever I feel something build up in my salivary glands. I don’t want to end up hitting some poor bystander that happens to be standing/walking nearby because that’s just plain rude Also I don’t feel the need to show off how much of a “manly-man” I pretend to be while “asserting dominance.” Stereotypical reason why men spit on the ground but you get the idea If you want @Arzaylea hi!

Now my peers are already becoming parents at 18-20 so not entirely unusual 🙃 Online classes are wack too, don’t get me wrong Yeah true but when you do them long enough, believe it or not, and this is coming from an introvert, I actually MISS going to in-person classes. I miss commuting to school and I miss my friends Anti maskers continue to clown about If you have a medical condition, then just stay home and have people get stuff for you I’ve been seeing too many Karens in viral videos yelling oh so loudly while crying that she has a respiratory condition and that’s why she can’t wear a mask. But like you’re yelling in a crowded space :WTFthonk: All essential workers do it anyway so It’s the new normal Once again, thank you for your service! Frontline workers deserve more credit and they shouldn’t have to lecture over and over again to the public about wearing a mask The foreshadowing predictions :kek: Yeah more young people need to realize that they’re not God. Covid doesn’t discriminate due to age Stay safe and stay healthy, all of you! samesies dogs are :dogeheart: lmao sounds just like a Bianca petition to un-fuckboy Viv's cat :LMFAOdead: imagine having a man who talks about you like you're a household pet sjdasdjklasdaljksa does lowkey sound like he's holding someone captive LMAO jajajajajajajajaja so demanding :smug: *goddess Jax faceclaim :hyper_eyes: relationship goals high school sweethearts :uwuhappy: AHHHHHH MY GAY HEART :lgbt_heart_sparkly: not me, im hopelessly single forever LMFAO ssdjkaldjklasdjlasdkla nah i see everyone on Bumble same XD :marafrogemoji: ive heard Benji speak but not Furi ;_; emergency VC time WE NEED TO DO VC AGAIN oh god no lmao ): we're doing accent reveals join HP reeeeee nuuuuuu come back ;_; awww guinea pigs :dogeheart: ): tbf there were way too many people talking at once so there's multiple topics going on xd Good luck my dude BOLAS is still top tier tho Looking forward to BOLAS2, literally the only Book 2 I’m invested in the near future When it hits 100+ chapters or so By the looks of things Sadly yes :hawyee: ~~But you’re Daddy HP~~ Yup from here on out, it’s MTFL daily Up until the next Wednesday of course with RT Agreed 👌🏼 It’s like a daily chore I actually WANT to do :LMFAOdead: Fine :bigmood: Another VC? :hyper_eyes: I can try, but gimme an hour or two and lemme see if the pirating website I use actually has the Cats movie yet lol :kek: And yes Tay Swift is in Cats I’ll ping y’all when I get around to finding the movie online :pleb: Gotta get some breakfast first I’ll finally have motivation lmao wb Max! kyo doing crime? 👀 :hmm: https://tenor.com/view/gorilla-spinning-funny-war-crimes-gif-18253130 Kyo as the getaway driver lmfao :kek: Petition to change Kyo’s nickname in this server to Baby Kyo https://tenor.com/view/yoda-baby-baby-yoda-baby-i-am-jedi-gif-15572435 Mhm Ahhh happy birthday Doge! 🎉 :dogeheart: :marafrogemoji: Doge: Become Deviant :dab: Clearly she had a bone to pick like the ones with the non-English characters in their username lol mhm ooo good luck Kyo!! remember everything you learned and do be careful yeah thats the one thing anyone could hope for, not an old timer whos gonna be overly critical of your every move and i always wondered how the hell they're still continuing those types of services during a pandemic Driving does feel that way for first timers but over time, you def get used to it and it becomes a basic life skill, like breathing and talking Sis same It’s just another way of saying you end up daydreaming I feel this on a spiritual level. You get so used to it, memorized your daily routes enough, your mind starts drifting into another world and presto, you’ve reached your destination safe and sound And then there’s me, a non car enthusiast who barely knows the difference between what’s a stick and what’s not :kek: :Dopeyhappy: That’s perfectly understandable Driving isn’t for everyone There’s no shame in taking public transportation Kyo same I get in this mood sometimes where my Spotify shuffle blasts a bop and I feel the need to roll down my window. Idk why but that’s a thing for me Like hey people, this is my music taste. Deal with it lol But most of the time, I keep my windows closed because I don’t want people hearing me sing Lmao same I know XD True shit Japan for sure has fantastic infrastructure and their public transportation is so clean and organized. I’ve only seen it through documentaries tho. Everyone is kind and courteous and has great manners America sucks in so many ways, not just transportation lol Japan is...resourceful Ironically their population growth is declining And not even covid Their expectations are virtually impossible to the average person Japan has its ups and downs There is no such thing as a perfect country Confidence Kyo 😤 Confidence Get it Girl You got this king Lmao Max Try try again You’re saying it like it’s a bad thing 🤣 Hehe :heresthemf: Lol same Stan the Server Mom Thank you for that fun fact 😂 Bread has not been active lately :/ Mhmm FBI OPEN UP Oh wait not America Welcome to the convo Enjoy your stay lol Dork..

That’s why it bothers me whenever people refer to the USA as “America” when that’s just highly incorrect. North America is the entire continent while the United States is just part of North America but US citizens apparently own the title “Americans” only so it stuck Nah I get your confusion. A lot of foreigners are confused whenever we call ourselves Americans but technically. Russians are also essentially Asian i think? idk Oop scratch that. Actually did a little bit of research. They wanna align more with Europe But got rejected I mean after the USSR collapsed, Russia attempted to embrace Europe, but failed, or perhaps was rejected Ugh the cultural confusion Forgive me, I just woke up *Sleepy* American but whatever Ew cats can be wack Slee🅱️ Viv Lmfao I have four more days to enjoy it while it lasts :kek: :sadbear: ye id be down for it as well either way works for me ah look at all that participation :uwu: Chó cái 2020 hút lừa tinh ranh :kek: I’m using Google translate because I’m that pathetic lmao I know With all my heart LMFAO Viv I love it Well one did colonize the other at one point 💀 Oh god yeah there’s that update It’s on the app It’s an added option They’re really experimenting with a non English language Max wants so bad to do another VC again lol You implied it when you wanted Viv to livestream it :caticon: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Google Translate is improving but still not perfect with other languages :marafrogemoji: Ooh we’re tagging ourselves now okay I’m the sand Because people are always stepping all over me :kek: Wait, you could pay for those even in the ancient days before modern technology?

I’m guessing that’s a yes Ah I see Forgetting to double check American student loan program For college Because the US doesn’t believe in free uni but they do believe in forcing students to drown themselves in debt 🤡 community college is good, cheap and good paced isnt adulting the best? you'd have to be desperate with no other options i hate it here my parents have the same mentality My finals week is this week as well Ugh I’m dreading the algebra exam on Friday Ikr Especially intermediate algebra Thx yay! congrats Kyo! 🥳 Lucky duck Baby college boi There’s always help for everything. That’s why we have National hotlines for when it gets really bad Sorry but that mentality just won’t do it for me. Asking for help of any kind is not weak and anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong, stubborn, and knows nothing A lot of countries do nowadays. Mental health is being taken more seriously, especially during current ongoing events worldwide Seriously and this goes out to everyone on this server: don’t ever be afraid to ask for help. It is perfectly, absolutely, positively, undoubtedly OKAY to turn to someone for guidance. Don’t try to do everything all on your own. You’re only human after all. Nobody’s perfect. They have experiences they can share and maybe you can learn from them Relate to them Etc new books by the looks of it and yeah, just 0 effort did PB really forget that all the MTFL LI names are customizable? why are they Mason, Noah, and Ava by default? thats just poor memory on their part Eugh Love how the convo just went from “I want a divorce,  give me your eyes.” to “Wait, I got Lexa’s ethnicity wrong?

It got to the point where one of them WISHED I talked and I’m still like “nah no thanks” “I wanted to talk about your son’s behavior.”
“Why? What did he do?”
“He’s too quiet!”
“Is...that supposed to be a bad thing?”
XD Tf Make it make sense well for one thing, my parents usually agree with any sort of criticism some "educator" has on me they dont hesitate to try and agree on my flaws and what can be fixed or improved upon when it comes to my grades/education but they never cared about my social life so 🤷🏻‍♂️ they dont have to worry about me "hooking up" or anything like that lol i was such an unproblematic child, i cant imagine them trying to tear me a new one about my tendency to root around people anyway like MC is sorry shouldve worded that better im saying i cant imagine an alternate me doing what MC is doing and then seeing how my parents would feel about it my parents shamed me for my homosexuality when i first came out so there's that :IDKher: but they wouldnt tell outside strangers about it, they think its something i should be hiding and its ok we havent spoke about it since and tbh, i prefer it that way. i dont need them constantly breathing down my neck when it comes to my orientation and something to criticize right now, its "focus on school" not "having a love life" and i can barely do either :LMFAOdead: and of course, they're perfectly okay with my younger brother having a girlfriend because "heterosexuality #1" i guess thx guys maybe someday i do want to talk about it with them just vent its quite alright will never forget the time my dad said straight to my face "i pray to God that one day you'll change" but i moved past that somehow he can go ahead and think whatever he wants, im not changing nor going back into the closet anytime soon my parents care way too much about our image and reputation for a middle class Asian American family so like i dont give a rat's ass how their extended relatives feel about me. they'll find out on their own time but really, its technically none of their business to begin with, especially if they're gonna have a problem with it agreed and im sorry you had to deal with that we all have baggage take your time, you're not obligated to do anything you dont want to do. its all up to you meant to reply to this but the message is the same remember y'all, its ok to be you :lgbt_flag: no i can definitely see your point. the world would probably be easier to live in once the ||conservative old people die out|| we're just hoping they havent forced their backward ideals onto their children or their children reject those ideals and educate themselves rather than hold on to every single word their parents shoved down their throats they do, i see them often. but they rather see more straight stories than anything else and the ones that are somewhat open minded, esepcially the cishet men, tend to just fetishsize lesbians gender of choice they've been doing that with a lot of LIs lately tbh i much prefer it that way mhm exactly, agreed the GOC LIs tend to have the personality of a piece of wet cardboard yes i stand by my statement shit thats deep like something you'd see out of a spiritual coming-of-age type of thing where your ancestors communicate with you with a blast from the past XD op.o o.op :LMFAOdead: :bigmood: deadass everytime i attempt to talk to my irl friends about Choices, their first guess is, "Isn't that Episode?" :LMFAOdead: its just the way i describe it 💀 Episode is just...not good lol yeah, apparently when you introduce the world of visual novel apps to your friends/classmates, they just assume they're all the same Episode-tier type of games lmao yes im excited for FA ngl it looks refreshing and hoping it doesnt disappoint meh i prefer the release schedule stick to the Monday/Wednesday/Friday system its easier to keep track of that way no i think mainstream society understands enough what visual novel games actually are they at least know what Wattpad is ~~its discrimination i tell you~~ :LMFAOdead: not all VNs are Episode XD its too "radical leftist" for some people MC and her sister are considered "pushy and annoying" there are a surprising number of Facebook conservatives who play Choices who just hate anything to do with climate change and LGBTQ+ awareness #choices-chat https://tenor.com/view/amy-poehler-high-five-seth-meyers-snl-great-minds-think-alike-gif-8276636 wep wep wep paz paz lmao i was XD i just wanted world peace for Christmas ;_; Armonía Oh I don’t listen to k-pop but I’ll give it a whirl 👍🏼 K-pop singer that Drew barely knows: *has the bod of a god*
Drew: Ooh me likey God almighty They do suck indeed *coughs* Oakley Clan *coughs* Birchport, nice 👍🏼 :eyez: Scarlett is indeed the bitch of Birchport lmao :mmYea: Yeah true I always spare Pierce Kate deserve a good life after everything she’s been through And Pierce owes it to her after the hell he made her go through No No sane principal acts like a mafia boss They’re usually either simplistic stuck up jerks only caring for the popular kids and jocks or actually genuinely cares about the student body and the school in general and tries to be everyone’s friend My high school went through both a good and a bad principal Started off with a good one and then graduated with a bad one But in all in all, both were never that condescending or power crazy Yeah it all depends on the school and the neighborhood it’s located in and how organized the school board/district is @dylan hbd! HSS But it’s more kid friendly-ish, so far from “freshman fantasies” Y’all can start calling me DaHomoDrew now :pleb: of course you been knew lol You could be bi but find yourself attracted to guys more. You might even say, you have a preference *within* a preference OH WAIT NO I GOT YOUR THINGY WRONG IM SO SORRY You have the He/Him role but you’re more hetero than homo. So you’re more attracted to girls than guys according to your results I apologize, I’m still waking up No, you have every right to be upset with me. I wasn’t paying enough attention This is what I get for hopping on Discord while my eyes are still adjusting Better that I acknowledge my own mistakes than to have someone else berate me for them later Lel Ooh noice :Bbay: I also hate that I memorized what your bf looks like and can definitely tell the resemblance is uncanny 💀 :WTFthonk: I- https://tenor.com/view/kekw-kek-bttv-twitch-emote-gif-15123134 God bless his poor soul He just radiates with himbo energy cool :pleb: I have no clue The Japanese terms were confusing enough to begin with Someone really got duped into thinking this server was for anything BUT Choices “Genius Inc Games” :LMFAOdead: Gobit Entertainment sounds like a scam/troll account It is quite disturbing... The person came in here with the impression that this is a 100% heteronormative game We’ve been bamboozled And so was that poor bystander :OOF: She’s a toxic slimy person who shouldn’t get away with shitty behavior just because she’s an “attractive woman” periodt No Chloe does Pls forgive us Father Furi :hawyee: owo Same but my mom’s hoarding antics are the ones that cause most of the yelling and fighting in my household The last she thing she wants is brand new expensive things. She’s the kind of person who picks junk off the streets just because they’re free and then shoves it somewhere in our home never to be used again They just take up so much space You’ll get through this Furi xd Welcome @Nocturo Fav book and LI? Do you play Choices at all? Have you read anything yet? Ah I see The quality content has overall declined but you can be the judge for yourself in terms of the older books I strongly recommend the OG books TC&TF and MW Oh and let’s not forget VOS and TH:M Lmao we’re just overwhelming this poor newbie with a bunch of suggestions :LMFAOdead: Ok but fr y’all #choices-chat before the staff has to intervene again 😂 don’t wanna do this to poor Furi only BOLAS :caticon: You get used to masks 🤷🏻‍♂️ It’s the new norm after all So long as you’re not one of them anti-maskers, you’re okay in my book LU NOOOOO Drake really decided to switch ethnicities Josh and Miranda need to be protected from tomfoolery tho Anyway we’ve been blessed once again with Viv’s wisdom Oh yeah I remember reading about that Awie Jeanette has gone through stuff as well And I’m pretty sure everyone knows this by now but I wanna emphasize it anyway. Nathan Kress is a father 😭😭 WE’RE OLD Right? Sam & Cat had only one season Raven’s Home is doing surprisingly well Victorious will always be god tier It deserved a proper conclusion YES I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE The two shared chemistry in the fricken pilot episode and I was rooting for them All those subtle times of Jade flirting with Tori were the best lmao Oh true Dan Schneider tends to incorporate a lot of creepy side characters Also correct Probably for that special holiday vibe. Since it’s the time between Christmas and New Year, it prolly would feel a lot more festive that way, like that’s our gift from PB https://tenor.com/view/being-examined-rings-hospital-staring-glancing-gif-18751242 I found leaked footage of you Viv :LMFAOdead: Lu is out here trying to one-up me with gifs smh xd F Did you not have high expectations with WB? Ah ok I see now I forgot that’s how you felt when we were discussing it yesterday indeed https://tenor.com/view/christmas-cheer-christmas-is-coming-excited-santa-dog-gif-12981674 hoo-rah furry party not that i can recall might have to ask around do it :pleb: 👀 You mean this one? Np 👍🏼 Well a lot of alcoholic drinks do have fancy ass names lol I see Eh I actually don’t do Christmas shopping Too much of a hassle and my family is on a tight budget, what with the pandemic and everything We don’t believe in gift exchanges lol My family focuses more on the religious part of Christmas Ooh noice Merry Chrysler 👀 Merry Christmas you filthy animal https://tenor.com/view/home-alone-macaulay-culkin-kevin-happy-new-year-greetings-gif-3617846 they're called synonyms for a reason 🤷🏻‍♂️ Merry Christmas! My state of California USA is still under strict lockdown orders because of our own covid surges but our police are too useless and defiant to fully enforce it Meanwhile more people dying, hurrah..... Idiots are still traveling for the holidays... I’m an introvert and I’m neither a goth nor a weeb Almost 2021 👀 But yeah some things just need to die but still haven’t, like stereotypes and homophobia Merry Flumas https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552192084455718913/791369906952208404/ConcernedFroge.png 🎇🎆 🤞🏼 Agreed. It’s been way too long since we had a brand new book with a GOC MC Gender of choice yas i always thought they were just fun names to add a little spice to the color roles just pick one if u want lol #color-role-channel read the directions first honestly im just so used to your European Squad color by now same with Furi you both match uwu embrace the shadow side note: i am LOVING the server icon ❤️ the gay bois :lgbt_heart_sparkly: Lurker Squad people are the ones who want to stay on this server but just wanna watch, read, and witness And don’t ping an entire group of people You’re not allowed to do that anyway 👍🏼 Idk, kicks, fun, etc. but it’s also disturbing and annoying for some people I don’t blame you. Overall content went downhill except a few exceptions Nice HSS is a fun read ^ OG HSS is the best The pfp just makes it obvious who you stan Uh the first statement, you mean like first person shooter video games right? Oh you were referring to your irl career Maybe don’t word it like that since it can be triggering for some people here Just spoiler tag that sentence or something https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549230468084531202/793193015082483732/ConcernedFroge.png 2020 was a huge disappointment in terms of Choices content but it gets a pass due to the pandemic Everyone had to adjust to working from home after all It’s nice to have a sense of community to share a common game app with It just do be like that How? See, I find the gender stereotypes of the video game world preposterous and outdated. It’s perfectly fine for both guys and girls to play a game like Choices. Anyone who tells you otherwise is just insecure and backwards. Have no shame. If you like visual novel games, you like visual novel games. Simple as that I’m just sorry you live in an area where that’s apparently frowned upon It’s just so dumb People need to grow up They’re raised on the mentality of “men should act and do anything tough and manly” “only women are allowed to show emotion and play those so-called girly games” Smh Some people just should not be parents That’s just toxic Due to obvious reasons... Sorry Anyway I’m just saying playing a game like Choices doesn’t make you less of a man nor more of a woman. Whatever you like, you like. Don’t let society get you down My parents don’t question my hobbies so I’m good Same. It’s a nostalgic field trip back to PB’s first game app HSS Prime You love the key limits? o_O Oh you mean in the context that it won’t cause you to be addicted lmao That makes sense Had I been VIP and have unlimited keys, I too would be playing Choices nonstop until my battery dies 🙃 See ya its a joke he's an iconic character from a movie franchise he is simply here on a mission: to love and protect doggos the proof is in the pudding obviously some heartless soul-crushing demon god now im finding all the John Wick doggo memes 🥺 Yes Of course. iirc PM has a single option Mhm Exactly what it sounds like Yeah don’t worry, it’s not some acronym lmao I promise you it doesn’t stand for anything in this context 😂 Bitch I ain’t a “she” You’re good Xd Yup in my timezone, it’s almost 1 AM Never (: See, there will be days where I feel like being a night owl and some where I’m not :caticon: This just happens to be one of those nights Hoot 🦉 Yup Wdym calculations? It’s my role LMFAO Americas squad Literally you can figure me out just by reading my roles lel No West coast Side note: I hate math with a passion NERD ALERT Jkjk I’ve always been a C/D student in any math class whoops Social studies/history is my strongest subject It comes easy for me then any others World history is my best but I also love human geography. One of the few things I actually miss about high school, if you can believe it Next to my tight knit group of friends of course Bro same In general, it sucked ass I hated it there Oh god Hoe, I never said I was a perfect genius :LMFAOdead: I am so sorry Me too tho Shut up :YellingWoman: :eyez: The ones at my school cared way too much for “school spirit” and “sports” and that gross stuff XD I never cared for school spirit tbh. So pointless and would often force me to talk with people and engage in social gatherings and ugh The introvert in me says NO to all of that That’s what I have my tight knit group of friends for Eww rich kids Just a few and I’m good with that. We shared a lot in common and they helped me through the hellscape that is high school I went to a somewhat conservative middle class neighborhood high school so like you can imagine the few kids sneaking in weed, Pride Club being hit with homophobic gestures, all that jazz Not me oops Exactly Not all of us have the same experience It was mostly the overwhelming classes and some shite teachers for me Just thank god, the peers I was surrounded by accepted me when I first came out of the closet. The one thing I was happy about Honestly if the subject should come up, I’ll mention it without hesitation I’m not ashamed and if people have a problem with it, then tough toenails 🤷🏻‍♂️ Hey no shame in being a straight ally. We could use more of those in today’s society Oh I definitely claim that title as well, especially back in middle school. It got to the point where even one of my teachers *wished* I talked more in class xd Well oof Well for me, I went through school minding my own business, keeping quiet, focusing on schoolwork, not speaking unless spoken to and just watching all the drama unfold from the sidelines I can semi relate to that. Growing closer to certain people made me talk nonstop. Basically I became annoying with specific people and quiet with others I was a bit of a try-hard with some of my crushes tho oml I was a gay disaster Pretending to share things in common, laughing at their jokes, just trying to read the signs 🙃 Eh I’m in college now and with the pandemic and everything, the only way I can meet new people for the time being is through an app :LMFAOdead: I’m going for an animal science degree and possibly pre-vet in the near future Studying to become a veterinarian What can I say. I love animals :Bbay: Animals are always better than humans, period Especially dogs Im a simp for dogs I second that lol That way, you’re able to find the injuries you never knew you had Yes I mean it’s suggested that you get roles so we get to know more about you but eh, that’s up to the staff team to decide Oh wait you were referring to what Arthurian said lmao I’m not talking about me personally but for the entire server in general I think it’s better off you don’t assume our ethnicity or country of origin. You kinda come off as a bit rude. Just ask “where were you from again?” And you’re good I’m saying others might @Deleted User You do realize OG HSS MC didn’t die right? MC just got injured, and therefore, you barely see them the rest of Book 1 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/549230468084531202/793193015082483732/ConcernedFroge.png Y’all are weird :ConfusedCat: Again Y’all are weird :IDKher: lmao What’s happening...what’s going on...who won the election 👀👀 Lmao hi, hey And why do I need rescuing? 🤔 I hate that you’re right 💀 By pulling them out of their miserable existence and the depression they pretend to have, not to mention their own insecurities, stupidity, and self doubt 🙂 But hey, good for you Kyo! I wouldn’t say deep, more like incessant whining but eh https://tenor.com/view/omg-yes-excited-yay-gif-9555834 Not “fuck.” They’ve used literally every other mainstream swear word except “fuck” I remember ass, shit, damn, and hell, but not fuck Yup Oh right I forgot about bitch Dunno why PB could do any other swear word except fuck You’ll only ever see dialogue like “Oh fu-“ but that’s it Bastard is a good one Lmao same A Viv-made Choices book. I could not believe my eyes :aww: You fought well brave soldier https://tenor.com/view/respect-davis-boreanaz-salute-uniform-gif-11216021 Oh damn totally forgot Wait wtf They are? Viv don’t scare me like that LMFAO Tumblr is a social media site. It’s not short for anything Yeah pls don’t do that The one in Croatia https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/531993-croatia-earthquake-kills-at-least-six-injures-dozens I mean obviously Cleanup will take a while https://tenor.com/view/mr-bean-waiting-still-waiting-gif-13052487 Me a Californian waiting for the Big One https://tenor.com/view/chuckles-im-in-danger-ralph-wiggum-the-simpsons-gif-14149962 You don’t have to have the app on your device just to stay in this server It’s really not that serious ^ HSS played that huge of a role in your life huh? I wish my hs experience was tolerable so I can’t relate I...just hated everyone and everything about my school Oop I hate that that’s true Especially for most American high schools Lmao Anyway homophobes often got off scotch-free, even when tearing down our Pride Club posters in order to “make a statement” and it was just stupid Just the tip of the iceberg why I hated my high school ... ||noice|| Smh Kyo :caticon: Kool kid Kyo Btw whatever y’all do, don’t rewrite the acronym for Kool Kid Kyo :PinguDab: Lu It’s 9:32 Pm 9:32 PM curfew is for old people 😉 That was....extreme.... ^ Mom, you can’t tell me what to do. IM REBELLIOUS! FIGHT THE POWER! REEE Maybe I should send YOU to bed @Arzaylea :mmYea: Lmao fine Mom said one more episode Nah I should actually get back to binging PM but i keep getting sidetracked lmao Oof I do not Have Hulu ITS NOT THAT 😂😭 Man we need to VC again, that was fun tho REEE ILY ALL Yaaaas whatever we do in VC will be fun 🤩 Hell yeah REEEEEE basically minigames you can play watch Kyo's stream enter in the code first tho go to jackbox.tv just chillin over in VC its a set of minigames DPWY #voice-chat-lurkers What’s up? I may or may not be able to help You have to ask the staff there well the 2013 Toyota Camry Hybrid my dad and i share has never let us down so far so i'd personally suggest that. im not a huge car enthusiast but as far as im concerned, im a Toyota type of person ooo It’s getting there lol Tho whether or not it’s gonna be happy is debatable :pleb: True true F Why you gotta do that? That’s the idea. We been knew. Choices is a means of escapism for us. A lot of visual apps are. In fact, video games in general. Let’s not forget books, movies, tv shows, etc. Point is, it’s fiction. Of course it’s imaginary. Not rocket science lol How is escapism depressing? I mean idk how your brain works but for me, escapism actually helps me get *away* from depression And sure coming back is hard but all in all, that’s life Eh I changed the topic to escapism so I’m good Damn half Mexican/half Japanese? That’s a very diverse bloodline That’s actually really cool You did Night Kyo Good luck Have faith or else :eyez: Night What are you gonna do with a pencil? O_o I’m afraid to ask Still not understanding the pencil reference but okay It’s an uncommon thought but it’s out there. Racism exists even in the non white countries China treated its black residents/tourists like shit during the Ebola outbreak And even parts of the UK are not too happy about Meghan Markle Because she’s biracial And people are apparently still throwing temper tantrums about the fact that a non white is married into an all white royal family Like really? It’s the 21st century. Grow the fuck up Diversity is always good. Some people just need to get their heads out of their asses to see it Well that just happened.... Anyway morning I guess Happy New Year’s Eve! Hope everyone is still saying safe and healthy! Can’t stress that enough haha Side note: you don’t have to be a minority in order to sympathize with them, just like how you don’t have be trans just to be upset with Rowling’s statements. So if you kindly stop assuming our identities like that, I think that would be appreciated Jumping to conclusions, playing a million guessing games, it kinda gets old ITS NYE 😤😤 Haha we’ll see :pleb: Actually I would be 100% down for that New Year’s VC Instead of watching an empty Times Square on tv lmao Ya yeet! for some parts of the world, yes remember time zones exist XD did someone say purge day? 👀 https://tenor.com/view/the-purge-wave-m-ask-god-gif-5636183 get some mental stability Lmao Furi, the DVD player has had enough 👀 Y’all, these muscle gifs :LMFAOdead: As a male homosexual, I’m not 💀 DVD actually stands for Doing Very Dirty Slick Rae, verae slick Kyo, why you always gotta diss your mother like that? :Bbay: NOOOO Don’t go after me Leave me alone I beg of you 😳 We been knew My bully in high school if I had one 😂 Or maybe an extroverted friend who adopted me and treats me as a doormat https://tenor.com/view/hi-cute-cat-hello-there-gif-13930462 @ everyone here 😂😭 @UB3R-B0T do you love me?

for medical purposes, i completely understand. but i just want people to be responsible with it if its for recreational purposes what a queen opinion since never, people dont often abide by the rules, let alone use common sense and courtesy around others oh god i've dealt with too many of those people back in high school, carrying around their speakers, blasting their music, their newfangled rap and hip hop XD could you pls move this into #current-events-talk ?

It helps the rich people get to the top without the hard work while the other social classes actually have to both work hard AND be able to pay for it. Eat the rich They turn to financial aid and/or scholarships if they’re eligible for them Scholarships obviously don’t need to be paid back so they’re more reliable. Financial aid tho for the more desperate, require you to pay them back, which is why crippling student debt is still a thing and ONLY an American thing There have been programs created to forgive student debt altogether, no strings attached but corporate America hates it when common folk get the easy way out like they do im too poor and cheap for Nitro, sue me :elmofire: 🤞🏼 Damn we gonna play mc today? 👀 :pleb: Oh no, we must summon Doctor Lu once more @Arzaylea yo hoe, we have a medical emergency 🤔 Did you drink from the tap?

I remember back then, they would instantly put in Book 1 in the title implicating that it was gonna be a whole series like for example ATV. Then after a long ass hiatus and negative feedback, the Book 1 part got removed and remained a stand-alone Yeah now they just wing it and wait for our feedback to determine whether or not it gets a franchise Yo I would love it if PB brought back the relationship status icons into the zombie book. It would make the most sense The people who hate you the most, their deaths are determinant and the people who like you a lot are your forever allies It Lives doesn’t count That was a Nerve score.

Makes me ill thinking about parents encouraging their kids of having some on their own for the sake of “continuing the bloodline, gene pool, or just having grandchildren who looks just like them.” It’s so stupid When parents make this half assed excuse “oh but you’ll change your mind once you go through the process of pregnancy UwU” uh no Especially with family health history That’s why Planned Parenthood is absolutely sacred and we need it, for the education Informing the public and what-have-you It’s annoying My children will highly likely be four legged fur babies and people are gonna have to deal with it :pleb: My fricken parents with my younger brother as we speak When I came out of the closet, they lost hope of me giving them grandchildren :pleb: I’m adopting mine I don’t want MORE people looking like me 🥴 The saying goes: gay people adopt all the children straight people abandon Exactly.

I’m not entirely sure I’m following Oh yes the Studio Yeah the Roblox Studio is where people can use their own assets and designs to create a whole game themselves and post it online for others to try out.

They are capable and charismatic, confident and intelligent, and are always dreaming about the next thing they want to do, but also about completing what is right in front of them. The dominance dragon personality exerts in their personal lives gives them a unique view of the world and helps them find their own path in life unrestricted by barriers of culture and knowledge. Dragons dream big and execute their goals, but sometimes they can fall prey to the charm of their own personality and become aggressive, overconfident, and fail to accept criticism from their peers and life partners. Without a doubt, the biggest enemy a dragon can have among Chinese Zodiac signs is his own self, as the overuse of their qualities can make them incapable of following a straight path in pursuit of their dreams. -LMAO NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS ME its ok, its all wrong about me anyway lmao shouldve just copied and pasted the first few sentences fanboy in my case but thats accurate enough for me me with Sims and Minecraft :e_minor: Madness my friend Is that a threat or a promise I see no wrong with this statement :jebus: I’m taking that as a promise I don’t use Reddit anymore :e_minor: CANT Y’ALL SEE THAT YOUR FIGHTING IS TEARING THIS ALREADY DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY APART Nah thanks I’ll let you take the wheel I AM A WHITE WOMAN VC? 👀 O Ugh I hate myself lmao Kk Have some good fries owo #multimedia-shabang for that discussion evening heyo fine nice :pleb: sometimes if i get in the habit of scratching them repeatedly yes that or first thing in the morning prolly getting ready for bed as we speak indeed is precious boi yeah makes sense the pain will be there for a couple more days or so might depend on the vaccine receiver :e_minor: my pain lasted only a day or two. somehow my immune system is that resilient? :hmm: it took me a while to figure out you were referencing to our illustrious wildfires :kek: :dogdance: Bing Bong all im hearing is "Rae, doordash Kyo" i dont have work yet :PES_Clown: yikes thats dumb men need to get their heads out of their asses and realize that cooking is not a gendered role. its a basic life skill :NM_HardDance: fuck toxic masculinity :flushBlush: probably but they're not common in the average household at least in the homes i've visited my dad had installed two toilets in our house that sorta kinda doubles as a bidet there's a feature that sprays water right up into our bootyholes my preschool aged cousin refers to it as the "magic toilet" whenever she comes to visit and wants to use it k;sdjajLDHD yes mhm effective and achieves peak hygiene oop :THANOS_BREAD: no :HibikiSmile: hey, Cs get degrees :02shrug: gn Kyo gl Kyo :NM_HenryDance: WHY MUST YOU GIMME A NOSEBLEED AT 9:40 IN THE MORNING https://tenor.com/view/nosebleed-thumbsup-gif-8882037 the Gaysian in me is SCREAMING rn OWO ~~i mean look at Jax?~~ jklsdaHDHFKSDHKLFJ oh yeah true lmao im turning 21 later this year, he's older than me still :e_minor: im the middle aged baby of this server Kyo is like baby baby .ud waipipo reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee JKL;SDFAJLKJKLSDFHA oh shit i forgot LMAO skskskskskskskskskskskskksksksks guess it depends on the gene pool of someone https://tenor.com/view/dorito-crisp-shine-chip-gif-12818097 i like America's ass bubble butt energy he could easily rest his chin on top of your head romantic lmao oop i want a mountain bf :shyduck: i just like owning up to my submissive ass self lmao i so want that someday :e_minor: :pleading_taco: bdkas;kfjjf;afklgf;sgjk;f oop no Jax is what we call Viv's irl bf lmao :kek: men the himbo is strong with that one :e_minor: :NM_peepoWTF: young grasshopper ye i watched a behind-the-scenes for ATLA. very professional of the show creators to bring in experts for the sake of animation accuracy the fight scenes are more authentic oooooo defo inch resting i see myself as either earth or water lmao fuck my zoom class for being at the same time as LOA :e_minor: THM male faces and ILB female faces well yeah QB faces were the ILB faces XD anyway have fun y'all it'll be on the list probably Laws of Attraction, a lawyer book And hey God, long time no talk *sigh* fine Long time no see Happy? :Bbay: Ily more :uwu: Yes Lame :NoU: Cool as a cu*cum*ber ~~harder daddy~~ :flushBlush: I defy your custom status :aPES_HuggingEggplant: Aww how kind and courteous of you But it still won’t stop my wrath :angelbutevil: uwu loyalty at its finest Throwback to Rusty era yes stan him or else ye i miss him so much and i wanna remember the happy times i've had with him :Duffyevil: https://tenor.com/view/evil-spongebob-gif-6081957 wow the more you know no silly, November is OBVIOUSLY the name of a small town consisting of hovels on the small island nation of My AssLandia :Bbay: knowledge hurts with great power comes great responsibility responsibility is gross :judgeyfroge: indeed im just watching youtube videos atm sleep good luck Bots are people too Good bot Good bot Probably not tbh Might depend on how much chemistry I have with them :hoopla: Lord grant me the strength if I ever crush on a guy named Peter or Vincent :e_minor: True Even so I’m used to those names being related to me It’s funny tho because Andrew is a common name and I met an Andrew on a dating app :kek: My name is Andrew so we just laughed about it My parents claimed it was just simply “easier to remember” Nah not anymore, not as much anyways So many weirdos out there :e_minor: Ah yes I had that as my custom status at one point. GTA: San Andreas is a classic Characters and story and all F Honestly with the pandemic and quarantine and stay-at-home orders, time is meaningless to me for a while now That is true My dog passed away a few months into the pandemic so maybe that’s why I stopped caring about time Way back when the world was as normal as it could be, I definitely cherished every moment I had with my son Car rides with him, music, binge watching, taking him to visit relatives, all that jazz Ofc, I won’t be replacing him. Just making more room in my heart and in my life for another kind and loving furry soul They don’t like to admit it but they were emotionally distraught after that day. They don’t want to be emotionally attached to a dog ever again. It’s why I prefer waiting to become independent to get another dog No they’ve made it very clear, no more Like said to my face with a serious expression, no more dogs Yeah they just process grief way different than me They don’t usually want to go anywhere I wanna go anyway. So I doubt they’d ever want to fall in love with another dog ever again. Stubborn Viet parents, always and forever Truth be told, if I can’t even change their opinion on gay people, then what’s even the point. It was my coming out when I realized they’re just stuck in their old ways. I just have to live with it. Its honestly exhausting trying to convince them of something I think is good but they’ve been raised way differently than what I learned for myself I know I should feel obligated to try a bit harder to change their minds but if they still refuse to acknowledge my mindset, I just can’t be bothered and leave them alone I wanna believe it’s that easy, to just up and open their eyes to the world from my POV Man the struggles are absolutely real :e_minor: Amazing name :bongocat: OMG SMOL BABY :bestinshow: ahhhh they're so cute Oop Anyway have some Rusty since i missed out on pet multimedia sharing ❤️ Fox fur baby Indeed :dogeheart: Viv would rather have men simp for her all the while simp for women.

FUCK OFF the day i record a video for all of the internet to hear my disgustang ass voice is the day Hell will freeze over yeah but then i become self aware and i hear myself talk and i cringe and die on the inside :hoopla: i havent completely accepted it yet, but i 98% sound like James Charles and i wanna rip out my own vocal cords :pepehandsup: sad @faede skank but back to this, yes indeed. kids are not objects to be put on display for their looks i mean they arent wrong it honestly bewilders my mind whenever people have kids just because they're cute but wont go the full way to make them happy on their own terms this is true, my dad still keeps my home videos of me when i was a toddler but they're on our VCR (yes we still have one) and we can just watch them at home instead of needlessly sharing them on the interwebs casual child exploitation wait what? LINK PLS what the actual fuck gross ugh thats just awful the double standards i literally have never heard of the name Huxley since the video game Call of Duty 3, some character was named Huxley some people just dont deserve to be parents i wonder if all these irresponsible parents are the reason adoption is expensive or it has always been expensive ugh why arent we cancelling the people that actually deserve it petri dish baby :e_minor: im wondering which is more traumatic tho, leaving the kids to stay in foster homes, or adopting them to begin with when family outings become scripted. what a concept aww thats good, be one of the few good ones that exist in the world awie yeah even then, people still feel the need to have their kids look exactly like them "for the sake of a pure and continuous bloodline" i see i see The fact that a logical and responsible person understands it is hard being a parent and takes it seriously is just a sign they would be a good parent.  It is those people that say they want 10 kids and have no plan on how to take of them that you have to watch out for. like cool, big family achieved, but are you willing to go through the long haul? yes sex education is seriously seriously important it boggles my mind how some educators are so hesitant and overly sensitive to teach all that very *essential* info to the youth. like no time is perfect. might as well do it ahead of time exactly truly. like we already have limited resources as it is thats shit reasoning why cant men also learn this stuff so they can actually learn and be morally sensitive and knowledgable then its up to the dad to do some hard research put in all the effort absolutely nothing wrong with men learning about women's hygeine yeah its usually the fault of the parents and/or the educators themselves school district truly ugh and it always stems back to the lack of assistance from the parents. its their responsibility to teach whats right and wrong. now we have men dumbing down their own boys and like Kyo said, schools should also play a role in that area parents and schools working together to teach both boys and girls about the full extent of health can go a long way usually clashing, yeah :this_is_fine: so laziness then 🙃  like back and forth "no you do it" my parents never gave me the sex talk either. instead they had to sign a permission slip just for me to watch a "Miracle of Birth" video in 7th grade science class :e_minor: it was uh informative to say the least :this_is_fine: it was at that moment im glad im gay lmao wusses i like to stay far away from the ||va-jay-jay|| as much as possible :pleb: we'd love to see it brave soldier tis a joke Kyo its a fun way of saying it (: like ||peen|| ;sdlakljDFHSDJK It’s me I’m the joke Wait is this the civil war one? 😂 Oh wait you’re not Rashon :kek: :kek: Both your names are Shadow Court ASDFGHJKL It’s me but not drunk Ok now I get it LMAO 💲 There’s the hint :kek: ASDFGHJKL Oop :judgeyfroge: America yo :pleb: Lemme check me shedule :e_minor: It’s woke Twitter and TikTok :kek: Yeah no To me Hmm I switch between the two every now and then personally Lmao Not kyo getting it wrong the first time Gray Christian Gray will see you now :Bbay: Mood simple as that huh? 40 minutes past midnight tis time for bed :peepoSleepBed: im literally just waiting for my brother to turn off the light in the bedroom bc we have to share a room :e_minor: yup :this_is_fine: lol its fine really. he'll be off to college soon so who knows three years younger than me mhm same its funny, we used to be at each other throats growing up but now we just simply tolerate each other. i let him do his own thing and he lets me do my own thing. we simply coexist without being neither distant nor close as siblings. its kinda weird but im ok with it. im genuinely happy for him about college not to mention the fact that my parents are pinning all their hopes on him now so i also feel bad for him lol truly, we have our ups and downs lol thats valid i got along with my younger cousins until a few of them grew distant. now i only talk to like four of them left bc we just get along so well there used to be more than four but their political affiliation did not align with mine or the fact that they grew up to be selfish and spoiled my older cousins are all academics so i feel so out of place just standing next to them hence why im the cousin that never shows up to family reunions anymore LMAO even before the pandemic, i just didnt bother anymore the fun times are now in the past also valid, we're all different yikes but yeah i still love the idea of having cousins i can still talk to, even tho the number had steadily decreased over the years ayo same @Asian Squad ayo you guys happy first day! This month is all about us. Please continue staying safe and healthy during these troubled times and never ever feel ashamed about where you and your family came from :rainbowhearts: :peepoYay: when Kyo forgets to nom, it upsets his mom when sonny hasnt eaten, mommy ends up screechin when a child forgets lunch, mother gets sad a bunch :Bbay: Henlo Tony Average as per usual, hbu? Maintaining a fandom will do that to you, I can imagine xd Noted :PES_Think: hahahahahahaha i have jury duty ugh adulting :e_minor: 🥲 biiiiiiiish, adulting milestones for the *both* of us :e_minor: :mild_panic: yessir i have. my first time voting was during the midterm elections back in 2019 and i also voted during the 2020 presidential election :confuseddog: :e_minor: :NM_SpongeBob: :evilpatrick: anyway i just looked it up. apparently its a common jury duty myth. some other factors actually contribute to the likeliness of you being randomly selected for jury duty Myth: You won’t be called if you aren’t registered to vote
Nope, this one is not true. In addition to voter registration records, names are also added to the jury duty list based on having a driver’s license, paying taxes, or owning a home. So definitely do not use avoiding jury duty as an excuse not to register to vote. Go do that now. ive done none of the last two but i do have a driver's license so :pleb: fruity, yus sounds about right only a matter of time :EYES: Oof that’ll be the day 👀 Hoe it was 6 AM when that conversation happened :kek: Imagine me waking up at 6 AM Also damn Silver does not want to stay in one place for very long huh Lmao valid :kek: PST yes Oh oop ITS STILL THE TOE ENTHUSIAST FOR ME :kek: can’t get over it lmao Viv’s forg toes are a sight :bestinshow: Love to see it hhhh Mood :peepoSignSimp: :owo: Ok I’m judging you less now :Bbay: Muscular Asian men are :dogeheart: Pics or else Viv :gun: :PES_WeebsOut: That is a true fact Fae Yes I do see :Bbay: Ooh dub voice Still seeing no pics Viv :PES_GunL: See what this bitch is doing to us Fae?

O Fae :kek: :stare: Hi Andro! Also me :patrickdab: Smexy Delish Oh god i do I wake up to myself talking ASDFGHJKL Sometimes I’m usually saying something about Rusty or my high school crushes War flashbacks must be a bitch Surprisingly no He’s completely moved on from the Vietnam War Nah my parents are never interested in that stuff, believe it or not lol I mean my mom can get passionate at cooking but eh Oh wow Oh shit ): hey Lu! depends on the daily routine how much fluids they've been drinking how active they are sdjklasdfhk but yeah my own bladder is usually on its own "imma wing it" mode ayo same except my mom is in her very late 50s and my dad in his very late 60s oh god yes, and their clashing personalities show bc Viv brings up weird shit in general from time to time :kek: yeah that too i myself have the urge after drinking a bottle of water or two @kaitoo AHHHHH WELCOME BACK LOVE IMY :PES_Heart: Bitch happy birthday! @kaitoo we just acknowledge both! yeah ayo hbd Arthurian! aww happy for you! 💐 you deserve it you can do it Lu ❤️ :peepoHappyhug: So I’m filling out my jury duty summons and uh my computer’s saved info is both concerning and amusing :kek: Side note: this aged well.

Or does it just put itself together and you just roll with it? Oof I used to get a preferable  amount of sleep back in high school, because I gave myself a bedtime otherwise I end up sluggish throughout the entire day. Then college and pandemic happened and I ended up not even caring much :hoopla: Sleep is wack Your body is always sending you mixed signals. It just decides for you whether or not you’ve slept enough Adulting happened Bitmoji finally made a story about me and you @azula :forg: So swag :forg: You’re not wrong lol My dad also used to wake up at 5 before he retired Now it’s just my workaholic mom 1-2 years, it depends on how old you are actually If you were still in high school, it’d kinda be awkward Yes In your 20s maybe 30s it’s normal It’s only not normal and unhealthy if you both rushed into it without a proper discussion or a second glance. This kind of topic, it’s a serious thing to have to sit down and talk about first Communication is key. A lot of older people I know rushed into having kids out of sheer pressure to give their parents grandkids or because “they’re so cute” Hey I think that’s appropriate, the 8 years I mean That’s a very long time It means y’all are in this for the long haul And that takes dedication I’m happy for you Viv Ilyt :dogeheart: Wednesday my dude I still love Asian Gabe :bestinshow: Oop Hilda is more active over in Spoilerland, a link you can find in #ads-and-partners and Altair is taking a break for school :flushedmonkey: honestly i just do oh *that* part i dont maintain my desk is a mess yet somehow i can play "Spot the Item" easily it truly do be that way oop have fun at work :poof: :peepoYay: same hither Roomba ftw most dogs are lol their reaction to a Roomba on internet videos are hilarious Rusty used to not react too much to the Roomba, he avoided it like the plague whenever it came near him but he never freaked out aww https://youtu.be/y9BM1M2C3Iw @azula and @kyo when they have their fights on this server Because forg :forg: i love social studies my best subject throughout middle school and high school everything else i more or less sucked at but history is where i thrive the most Yes :MunchlaxMunch: I’d definitely tell my children like it is, no sugarcoating It’s so cute when dogs snore :bestinshow: owo and then there's me, im the one doing the awkward staring from behind a windshield but they never notice me and i lowkey prefer it that way confidence, whats that? dunno her name :IDKher: y'all find people? i usually avoid them like the plague https://tenor.com/view/i-hate-people-loner-introvert-be-like-gif-9786836 :pleb: man whatever happened to just admiration from afar im too introverted for that scene havent even been to a gay bar yet let alone a club :e_minor: hhhhhhhhhhhh jesus everyone's gaynging up on me LMAOOOO US men are a.....species entitled is def the word i'd use esp after watching Straight TikTok is it tho? :e_minor: their little knees must be sore from jumping to conclusions hetero men they come up with all sorts of crazy excuses, they have a whole ass checklist before they even think about giving up on a girl insulting is funny to watch nowadays everyone has a smartphone so they whip out the camera after the man doesnt take no for an answer all these viral videos are surfacing of men relentlessly following women and its blood-curdling eugh i literally join whenever i feel like it wholesome there's a bedrock edition? :hmm: prolly 13 14 is normal it varies for everyone "i hate modern society" mood my favorite quote wise beyond their years anyway it wasnt until i was like what 15 or 16 before i towered above my parents maybe 14 my facial hair came in early and i hated it LMAO i looked like an ugly man as a teen but with a disfigured baby face i really dont like facial hair on me so my mom waxes them off every few weeks (: waxing slows the process of it growing back and i prefer that way, but yeah its painful after i came out, they literally just told me get school done first before even thinking about "that kind of life" OOP as for my brother and his gf, my parents made it VERY clear that nothing more should happen until after college surprisingly, i dont think my brother is that kind of guy and neither is his gf. he kept going on and on about waiting until after marriage yeah he's more hardcore catholic compared to me watch me become an uncle before i get my first kiss :kek: no way really LMAO LU aww i used to do this sort of thing when i was nitroless when mara got mad i stole her frog emote lmao :judgeyfroge: all my homies have nitro and flaunt it Virginianity mood mister papa, thats actually really cute in viet culture, i call my mom and dad Me and Ba :Bbay: you mean British? :kek: hmm LMAO i wish my parents were that free spirited. they act like i was possessed by Satan when i said the word "tampon" nope ^ yeah my household is male dominated so :hoopla: its literally just me and my brother but my parents still wished for a daughter ;daskjkl;dfklfjsdhaj saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame bestie :kek: KSDFLADFLKSDFGJSJFDKSDFGLASJKAF VIV U HAVE NO FILTER TODAY a titorial god im loving this discussion :MunchlaxMunch: well when we talk about women's biology, it never stops yes lmao WRONG PERSON PINGED LMAOOOOO https://tenor.com/view/bettemidler-bette-midler-hoochiecoochie-hellodolly-gif-9275452 :PES_HyperReee: i https://tenor.com/view/iron-man-tony-stark-mark50-foot-thruster-flying-gif-19216524 :elmoburn: https://tenor.com/view/salttruck-gif-8448136 SAME TIME same braen :cat_twerk: LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO Kyo deleted it, not me :kek: :concernedStare: :frogishocked: :petthefrog: :frograte: :WorryFrog: :frogspinny: :4994_FrogVroom: :NM_peepoTansformWorry: Yes lmao :e_minor: Is that a threat or a promise?

It’s not too confusing if you really think about it. Being bi simply means you’re attracted to the two main genders, male and female. Hence why bi means two. Like a bicycle has two wheels. Pansexual means you can be attracted to any age consenting human being regardless of gender. So like you can find yourself attracted to a non binary peep, non conformer, etc. Yeah trans is not a gender. It just means that you are NOT the gender you were assigned at birth since it doesn’t match with your gender identity that you feel deep down inside and are in the middle of transitioning Bisexual—attracted both to people of their own binary gender and to those of the other binary gender. I would think so, yes?? Np even tho Fae did a better job at explaining it than me ~~Not Viv thanking everyone else with hearts and not me~~ Jkjk I’m an over thinker and I still have a lot to learn I’m sorry okay? I really mean it As I’ve said, I still have a lot to learn Truth be told Fae, I’ve gotten crapped on in this server so much, I can’t tell the difference between people genuinely being mad at me or just poking fun at me for the fun of it :kek: Like I’m okay with being bullied for uh fun, but it does get a little too much from time to time Idek maybe I’m just overly sensitive :hoopla: Better late than never I suppose lmao But thank you (: Oh damn Two decades old gang :e_minor: Ugh ikr It almost doesn’t feel real No it’s fine really.

Dude, as we were discussing this just days ago, I literally woke up from a nightmare similar to this, only more intense and terrifying. Something straight out of a horror movie. For whatever reason, I landed myself back on the first day of senior year in high school. I had just finished reuniting with my friends and everything and once we got back to class, random students starting pulling knives out and started ||stabbing each other to death, almost indiscriminately|| turned out there was a much more darker story behind it. It was like some sort of cult uprising taking over my hometown because when I escaped campus, everything around me was destroyed or set on fire. It got to the point where I got trapped in a corner by the leaders of the knife wielding cult when I woke up, actually breathing heavily like I was having an ||anxiety attack|| I don’t think I’ve ever had a dream that intense to the point where I woke up nearly out of breath. I hated every minute of it and never want to experience anything like that again. Dreams truly be weird and a theme Yeah truly chilling Well I did recently wrap up a reread of ILB AND Lu and Fae got me to binge the Saw movie franchise in my spare time so my brain is probably slowly getting used to the horror genre than ever before LOL Now it’s entering my dream world :e_minor: Anyway yeah I woke up genuinely terrified and it was just a horrifying experience. Everything was so vivid too ASDFGHJKL It was :/ The most recent one, where you got chased I think so? You didn’t give much detail than that xd ASDFGHJKL Creepy and bizarre me same the best life dangly Money for skool Bread :takemymoney: inch resting also josadjkskghfhisdhfsa well thats just rude :aPES_Sob: tease us why dontcha reminding us how poor in Robux we are wait, does that imply there are NSFW stuff in that game? o i see i see yeesh sure lemme close Sims first LMAO people are always dragging me im used to it (: Uh What Does he have a “Catchphrase of the Day” calendar or something?

That’s equivalent to accusing Choices of being homophobic :kek: Sure the rep isn’t perfect but at least it exists. Frankly I count my blessings and am thankful for the MLM content I actually do get so like :02shrug: Besides imo, the GOC content is improving slightly nowadays. BaBu is realistically the only genderlocked thing in the release schedule these last few weeks and OH and LOA outnumber it And SB for the VIPs But Jesus imagine throwing around that word not even knowing what it means :NM_PensiveSad: Ok I’m done now lmao People are just weird Bottom line, just don’t jump to conclusions without doing your diligent research and education :micdrop: Yes ma’am :PES_Salute: it uh was wild i woke up to it myself lol after skimming it was kinda :yike: :when_u_find_the_good_booty: :aPES_PooPooCheer: oof in the meantime hang in there Mad thats valid i mean when it comes to the second dose, gotta let your prior engagements know, whether its someone in person or your work wack sad Oop Just put a muzzle on the kid Problem solved :e_minor: eh im ok with the default size the way it is doesnt really matter to me the way it looks 😅 :aSweat: gn literally the one thing i hate about it is the heat esp here in Cali we dumb lmao but yeah anyway the high for my area is about nearly 80 F casual global warming :e_minor: ^ id much rather freeze than melt any day :4828_ChrisEvansPeriodt: personally i'd take any excuse to bundle up with a hoodie and tight jeans hoodies are goodies bitch i could never sdaljslhfklsgk i'd die mood layers are used for hiding and protection :Bbay: 68 in Cali is actually cool af lmao anything below 70 is cool for me oooh kimonos thats something i dont hear about every day truly Japanese knows whats up hmm i've only ever experienced silk but as a mattress covering xd you mixed it with some other material. you might be thinking of leather hoe trade with me i can only ever see snow in the mountains ;_; which is funny enough since my hometown is situated right up against some foothills so i get gorgeous views of the snowy mountains in the winter *laughs in me waiting for the Big One to hit California* catch me unwillingly swimming in the Pacific when i have no choice kids, imma sink yes runs right through California San Francisco lies right on top of it but i prolly live a couple hundred miles away from it its me watching the movie San Andreas and being like "yeah i aint surviving that" but truly the educational stuff is fascinating one of my favorite things about earth science hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh literally it could just strike out of nowhere and i'd perk up my head like :HuH: eh actually thats more Japan Cali its rare but occasional the last major thingy we had was with Ridgecrest and i was able to feel that from far away our infrastructure just aint prepped for it so like :e_minor: teehee my house gonna turn into a pancake no not possible here in Cali our weather is weird, like iirc, the big ass mountains prevent any major stuff from occuring. which includes major storms and stuff we basically have a shield ugh its been ages since i took earth science the worse things we can get are mudslides jkdklskhfsdkfs fuck the alarm imma head out idc LMAOOOOOO EA WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY Electronic Arts really said "fuck them kids" i just love it so much, the goofiest most illogical thing can occur and im like :MunchlaxMunch: bahahahahahahahahhaa uh not with that caption lmao much better, no politics oh no, their behavior is definitely the fault of the parenting usually i hate both (: exactly hating children is becoming a large part of being an adult :smugdoge: i mean its the truth, all human babies are ugly as fuck but not everyone is ready for that conversation :kek: literally same, i couldnt hold my baby cousin a few weeks after she was born bc i couldnt trust myself :frogspinny: Shonny munchkins that'll be the day oh shit really? 👀 the odds of having twins are so interesting to me. we really just accept the fact that its randomized jsdjlsadhfjlsdfjjl Shonny gonna spoil them rotten like he does with us yeah my family doesnt have that type of fertility either no twins or triplets afaik jesus fucking christ no, i just looked it up. its just nine individual babies they all survived iirc but god the odds of that many surviving is just beyond.... omg ooooo wild I have none 🥲 I just wait it out and it goes away on its own :e_minor: ^ Oh yeah I forgot about water Ooh I like the hats!

differently, had they invaded your entire food storage that should only be reserved for spiders :smugdoge: valid i only have to deal with ants when the weather gets rainy and wet since they're trynna seek shelter indoors but like my food is out and about and i dont want nasty ass ants all over my noms so its hello spray in the summer, i worry about the damn pesky flies :e_minor: i shit you not, i go ballistic with the fly swatter throughout the summer sdfjkljdfjjf that would be so fucking terrifying :jebus: LMAO my dad actually was smart enough to install some sort of heat-related fly trap just above our stove. they somehow get sucked into this little vent and you can hear them buzzing around up there, struggling to find a way out but not before they die of heat exhaustion. so then every time my dad cleans it out, he's basically carrying a tray of dead fly corpses and its so disgusting to look at nah they dont fall into the pots and pans below he made sure of that KLSDJKLDASJK honestly for me, if it has more than four legs, it must die :kek: exceptions are ladybugs and roly polies for some reason thats why i said they're the exception dk;jklkdkdsa i find them cute ~~which

feeling to drive to your old high school but also being able to leave right after because i do NOT miss that hellhole LMAO the "sweet" part is missing my friends and getting to hang out with them on campus. the "bitter" portion however is remembering all the shit i've have to put up with, whether it was annoying teachers or toxic classmates ugh all that school spirit nonsense and forced participation in activities i wanted no part of, i dont ever want to experience again the themes they came up with were just cringe ~~my high school was prolly the only one in the entire world to have a Fortnite themed spirit rally~~ ugh dont even get me started on the forced Pledge of Alleigance bullshit i had only one friend who actually defied it and got in trouble with the school her parents were able to defend her and her record is clean iirc bc literally, people shouldnt be forced to "pledge alleigance" esp if the words dont align with your beliefs "one nation under God" whoever changed that line really did not stop to think that not everyone believes in a God wild to think that line was never even a part of the pledge it used to go like "One nation" then skipped straight to "indivisible" ayooooo as long as everyone is fully inoculated meh im done anyway ngl im still gonna be wearing my mask for as long as i feel comfortable doing so i dont trust other humans if i ever get the chance to reunite with my friend group, then maskless we shall be bc i can rely on them to believe in science (: literally same :jebus: im okay with anything below 80 oh you just described my lovely state of California LMAO glad i dont have to deal with that stuff anymore. deadass i had days where im too lazy to stand up and would much rather just stay seated at my desk lmao im the same

its cool BB is a good one cool favorite book: VOS. favorite LI: Sawyer from BSC :P mhm BSC is my favorite romance and VOS my favorite mystery anyway hope you enjoy your time here! :DogsOfDiscord_2_CuteDogSmile: hello welcome! hope you enjoy this server oop it be like that asjkldjksjsdlahdsa you also pretty much mentioned you dont want to tell them what happened Asian parent nagging should be avoided at all costs :e_minor: italian man you say :eyesshaking: ^ post it dont give a rat's ass about what anyone else thinks :cheers: oh lord :booster: :nyooom: :sadbear: go off on it Viv yeah still not working. by any chance did you use a completely different one? its more darker than last time or maybe you didnt save it in a correct format like you thought it said gif but it didnt yes her lips are moving yeah its just her mouth ah yes there it is mine is just catching up yes depending on what you wanna do its your choice click to make things happen and the rest will follow oh yeah there's a setting to have story progression on so your sims will react to anything that happens around them no you can switch between families at any time you dont necessarily have to stay with one family unless you actually want to erm its prolly easier if i just explain over VC sdjkakl;sja its not that complicated but imma have to explain that way anyway you literally just click on objects and locations for your Sims to interact with im basically very generic. i make a custom family, have the adults get jobs, the kids go to school and have them progress through their lives like a regular household my main goal is usually to earn a lot of money to get a nicer house and if the furniture is not up to my taste, i just replace, sell, and buy new ones and when it comes to continuing the family tree, i usually prefer only one child per generation bc lord knows i've tried my hand at 2-3 kids and its super overwhelming to take care of the siblings oh yeah and job progression, i have a Sim master some type of skill so that they can climb the career ladder faster bc i like to see results immediately sorry im slow this morning Summer heat makes me lethargic but yes to answer your very first question, i always stick with one family instead of moving out to someone else's. cause that way the household funds remain high where they are and i can remain wealthy the craziest i've dealt with are home burglaries and aliens making my sims, both male and female pregnant lmao i dont make them happen, they just do on their own yeah one of the reasons i dislike Sims 4 is they removed burglars for "trigger reasons" they're afraid of triggering people but like its not even that serious EA thinks some players could possibly have been traumatized by burglaries irl probably Sims 4 really missed a lot of things that made the previous three games special school buses the color wheel the RGB custom system i like having those to match up colors the way i want to, whether its Sims' clothing or furniture around the house https://youtu.be/E8CtcnO9zAI speaking of which, will never forget how Sims 1 burglar music was basically a horror movie soundtrack 2 and 3 were like mischievous and hooligan-like mhm asdjklajlaj i miss the realism toddlers not even a day old telling guests to behave or be kicked out of the house lmao :kek: @faede YOU’LL ENJOY THIS :KEKWhands: :lmaoNO: Jack judges all no they're still here Kyo prolly pinged them wrong lmao @هسك. there nah nothing is weird when it comes to your fur baby's milestone every year Rusty got older when i first got him in middle school, i couldnt help but think about what might come. but then i push the doom and gloom out of my thoughts and focused on the present rather than the future its completely understandable to feel all sorts of emotions as your pet gets older its your child after all ugh same its not fair dog years suck so much ooh and sea turtles live up to 30 and 50 years https://www.extremedogfence.com/bluey-the-worlds-oldest-dog/ man what a legend 29 years and 5 months fr, a true badass Mornin :popcorneat: and he's left you hanging ever since :hmmm: spit them facts Metta same here god sausage, pepproni and chicken are best on pizza. its why i love Costco pizza from time to time and there's a Red Devil's in my hometown but idk if it has additional locations :perfect: mmm farts tasty :BooParty: wait did he even had kids?

Louass that is literally me insecure and reluctant to share my interests and tastes so both well how have your parents coped with it? maybe you can get advice from them? mood well for me, its the way that even when i do share my stuff with others, they never respond nor ackowledge and i just end up deleting it all so no one would see. obviously no one would care so i just dont bother sometimes I guess it just stems from a history of me wanting to be outgoing back in elementary school and asking my classmates if they watch the same shows and movies as I do and the more I got put down for it because they’re “lame” or “for babies” the more I grew to not want to share anymore. In fact, I just became all secretive and ashamed about it. Ily2 Viv Ye and I’m still happy to be here :CaughtIn4K: Ugh I always hated those jokes, esp if it involved dogs I will throw hands Beautiful :kek: No filter :stan: :e_minor: Gnarly *appear confident* LMAO DEFINITELY NOT ME It would take a miracle for Sheng to make a man out of me :e_minor: Oop @azula I still remember when you told me one of your relatives was in Bird Box and I watched it again and I was like “oh ok I can see it” Ye Crazy OH WAIT NVM I’m stupid As usual It says San Francisco on his Wikipedia :e_minor: :judgeyfroge: I’ll take your place so it won’t be weird :DogsOfDiscord_2_SMUG: :eyes_sus: Joke’s on you Viv, it’s still in my phone notifications even if you deleted it :smugdoge: hot Fine bestie.

The SHOWERSOCK is a disposable sock with anti-bacterial, anti-fungal as well as fragrance and moisturizing properties. Think of it as a shower cap for your feet except that you are also able to wash your feet through the sock while the sock is protecting you from fungal and bacterial infections." still weird to me good thing i dont plan on living the dorm life any time soon :smugdoge: id still rather shower with nakey feet it makes the most sense to me in my household anyway shower socks are the wack ones wym no u ... and shower socks arent? :e_minor: djklalsdfkjfjksdkdf SAME MIND PAIGE thats why God also invented overalls lmao is Metta that old?

It was so easy to make my way around the taller kids during passing period My brother who is three years younger than me is now taller than me. I hate it here LMAO The struggles are real :e_minor: Truly oop thats a big no-no in an Asian family we get our money's worth until the item is ultimately useless :e_minor: "Other than Christianity, another mainstream religion that is commonly practiced around the world is Islam." ~~dont judge me, my essay prompts growing up have always been so basic~~ yeah i figured :e_minor: blankety-blankety blank is a big mood yeah Islam's is just way more backwards and primitive compared to everywhere else @Arzaylea ooh you could also write about their holy pilgrimage to the city of Mecca and how they have to achieve it at least once in their lifetime. or the Kaaba itself Yeah same Weird peepeepoopoo Rae said poopoopeepee lmao :Sadge: #multimedia-shabang yup :Bbay: and i oop Sushi shenanigans ooo fun what do you do exactly? being given too much of it lol :eyesshaking: fun ooh for mature players/audiences o damn it sounds exactly like a video game plot fun times there always has to be an old teddy bear in the little girl's hand lol good luck Lu!

They use (usually anime-inspired) computer graphics-generated avatars created with programs such as Live2D and with characters designed by online artists." wack the light green one Morning That is a normal thing that they do Your stanky odor is what makes them feel safe and secure in their environment :) morning :nitrowumpus: It be like that during the pandemic Insomnia maybe? its much better than the Cats musical for sure Scott is our king we stan DADDY SCOTT LMAO https://youtu.be/RKDAorrYg8g you made me think of this skit video 😂 ma'am, have you been watching too much Final Destination? djklksdha ok but in all seriousness, 40 miles is nothing compared to the 50/60 i've seen people try to pull on non-highway roads also im rarely on the sidewalks anymore, im usually the one driving 40 in a designated zone not to mention the fact that i live in a state where you dont need to be special or even qualified to get a driver's license. Californians drive like morons oop but yeah i get your paranoia sometimes woosh indeed i can also feel the impact in the car itself bc someone will just zoom past me in the next lane over and it actually makes my car shook yup :HideThePain: average, hbu? passed my first try but yes you can do it! Metta graduating to ancient gang JKLDSAJKDLSJA i may have passed my first try but i only received three mistakes bc i prolly forgot to look over my shoulder before changing lanes at one point :e_minor: luckily my instructor was a young woman so she was lenient but professional and not some old grouch who expected me to drive like an old person i know and i did both hands, 10 and 2 honestly it was the easiest test ever jlasdjksdshkldf he sounds so proud of that reputation lol Lu: finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be LEGENDARY! then there's me, still not knowing the difference between stick or whatever else there is out there stick and manual vroom vroom :kek: the duck facing down Lu's car: ~~and yes i know its a goose~~ :pleb: :Duck: :NM_DuckDrunk: aight y'all, tag yourself: -big titty identity crisis

The fact that there was a third wheel involved 👀 I like them all tbh. I cant rank nor favorite lol Third was Election Year correct? Ye. First movie was the rich Sandin family mansion. Second movie was Anarchy throughout Los Angeles, third was political D.C. and fourth was the prequel origin backstory Frank Grillo :samsunghot: I mean the first movie was from the rich people POV and the second movie was from the poor people POV. Best of both worlds imo. Defo. Neighbors getting easily jealous over the other’s success and luxury I just didn’t like that it took place in the same exact location. I like it when the Purge universe is explored more out on the streets 2nd season of the tv show was really cool because you get to see what American life is like off-Purge and how PTSD just runs rampant for everyone Triage peeps TFW you only just realize that hospitals are actually neutral safe zones in the first season of the TV show lol Lu you’d be totally safe if you worked overnight during the Purge 😂 Yeah their story was sad. Lowkey thought if both survived, they were gonna magically hug and make up the next morning because love conquers all trope but whenever he tried to be the hero, it didn’t always work out :( OMG NOT THE GRANDPA THAT SUCKED The concept of poor people selling themselves to the Purge just to give their families a better life is just horrible UGH Lmao The Purge is one of many reasons why I love the concept of dystopian societies in multimedia The sass for me 😂 They must be uncultured :DoD_Pensive: Omg them What made me a lil upset is that it wasn’t actually Miley Cyrus’s voice singing it on the radio and was some butchered version but ig that was done on purpose for max dramatic creepy effect lol Cause it was all distorted and such Mayhaps Don’t forget the foreign tourists who dressed like a fucked up Founding Father and Lady Liberty :e_minor: And when Leo ||finally switched the footage to real time and you see the dead body on the floor, like|| OH DAMN THEY FUCKED :pleb: Lol yeah I just caught up with the “knocked out” part and I was like uh no that dude was ||defo dead|| :KEKWhands: IM SLOW OKAY There No ones the wiser :Bbay: oop :e_minor: :DoD_E: oh no are we gonna have to binge the entire movie franchise just for Fae?

I thought it was of natural causes Fuck :( I don’t blame you. Pudgy was a king Honestly I’ve read too many heartbreaking stories before that fateful day where owners would just walk out of the room crying because they couldn't bear to look while the dog looks around in confusion wondering where their human is as they’re about to drift off and I just couldn’t do that to Rusty. I wanted to stay in that room to make sure that the last thing he saw before he closed his eyes was my face, the one thing that was giving him comfort and security dont get me wrong, i dont blame anyone who gets too emotional that they dont want to see it happen before their very eyes but i hope more people know that in their darkest moments, dogs rely on you for reassurance. to the very bitter end, as others might say no its fine. you're good. putting down a beloved pet is one of the hardest decisions to make but ultimately, once you review the quality of life and realize there's not much else to do, you really have no other choice. i'd rather end the suffering now quick and painless rather than "wait it out" until it gets MORE painful for the dog. its selfish to to force them to go through all that. might as well get it done and out of the way, end the suffering asap im not gonna sugarcoat it but it is what it is i've made peace with how the world works more or less massive props to all the hardworking veterinarians out there it must be a tough and emotional job thanks Tay, and never stop letting dogs into your heart and life. its gonna be hard but its worth giving them a life worth living because they deserve it ❤️ :forgheart: sounds like someone else i know :forg: LMAO damn Sims 4 really added a lot more in same im excited for True Colors It’s 6:49 AM over here rn Couldn’t go back to sleep after waking up, figured might as well just stay up Ye.

area. don’t see a whole lot of them Viet moms always name their sons something that’s either generic or unpopular OMG I FORGOT ABOUT THIS CHARACTER childhood always party with this Henry tbf all the trains from the Thomas franchise do lmao choo choo bitch -NHTSA’s slogan probably National Highway Traffic Safety Administration i’ve been listening to too many ads that were paid for by NHTSA reminding motorists to not cross the railroad tracks when the train is about to pass through ye, i have such vague memories of the last time i rode the Amtrak it was fun oh wait, it might’ve been Metrolink, not Amtrak, that i rode as a kid Japanese high speed trains tho, it would be cool af to ride those or even the Maglev in China valid i also just remembered the maglev is not exclusive to just China :hoopla: ooo driving is also fun no doubt air travel is the most popular industry in the US esp with some good ass music and being by yourself in the car california mood truly yes the freeway feels like actual heaven when there are no cars around my vehicle’s radius not having to constantly watch my sides or behind. just looking straight ahead and enjoying the scenery cali traffic sucks but driving during non-rush hour with music is therapeutic ugh yeah. toll roads have their pros and cons less traffic because people want to avoid paying for it, but also, paying for it the other one has way more members i believe they're just not active we're the better one obvs LMAO facts I SAW THAT VIV :eyez: jè æÜgh https://youtu.be/Cap0BOzizbw VIVE LE FRANCE lame https://tenor.com/view/penguin-hide-you-didnt-see-anything-penguins-of-madagascar-gif-15123878 https://tenor.com/view/agatha-wink-gif-20772888 :PinguDab: mornin it is my mom and brother coincidentally had a similar interaction. only my brother suggested my mom SHOULD dye her hair but she refuses and would rather get rid of her gray hairs the old-fashioned way: tweezers now my mom regrets birthing him neither does my mom lmao working woman life i don’t get gray hairs from stress, just acne breakouts :e_minor: oof nice! mine has mostly healed throughout the years drink plenty of water kiddos ree yeah i find myself doing this more and more now it happens but it’s also true what they say. it becomes less frequent as you get older. and the more you ignore it, the more likely it could go away on its own probably depends on one’s gene pool mhm side note: i really need to stop eating greasy meat lmao also same luckily to get to my classes, i often have to climb a lot of stairs so that’s a plus my dog used to be my motivation to exercise but now it’s just my school being hill-y as hell with all our stairs girl, i remember a time when it was so normalized for two teenage girls to pop each other’s pimples right in the middle of high school english class 😂 i’m literally sitting nearby at my desk doing work and i hear two high pitched “ouchies” i also had a friend junior year who would watch pimple popping videos on instagram because they’re satisfying to watch 😂 no clue lmao what’s even funnier is that she got me invested as well and i would lean over her shoulder to watch with her 😂😂 everything dermatology told us not to do, we do it anyway :PinguDab: the resulting pus is disgusting tho definitely lying to themselves (: i wash my face every day but the pimples still come and go i’m not always thorough tho but a washcloth is better than nothing all washing your face does is just getting rid of the previous day’s dead skin cells same all we had was biology lmao the teacher just gave us that advice when she bothers giving the time of day yup and my anatomy class was deadass cheating central and the teacher knew it because she let us look at our study guides during exams 💀 easiest A i ever earned asdfghjkl ofc a handful of teachers at my old high school achieved tenure so they got away with that shit mood thanks to programs like Proctorio, it makes cheating virtually impossible lol it be like that it does glad my Proctorio days are behind me. i’m genuinely motivated to listen and learn when i’m in the classroom program where you’re locked in your online exam and the camera has to be on at all times to monitor you for any sudden body language when you’re working on your exam you can’t have any other tabs open my professors would make me readjust my camera so that my desk and hands are viewable to be recorded my chem teacher didn’t care about adjusting cameras so i was able to half ass my way through that final exam lol too much math combined with science the only thing in my background is the living room window blinds. my computer faces a corner of the living room so i have a cozy corner to do my studies ofc there’s the annoying sunlight that pours in and caused a glare on my PC screen during that one time of day ye it’s better that way but then then sunlight gets in your eyes depending on how many windows you have lol or lack of curtains thereof bro the pandemic actually turned me into a vampire i hated having my windows open during lockdown lockdown gave me an excuse to stay indoors and i did not want to suffer from the evil rays 😂 because i’m such a gamer light burns me i thrive in darkness and gloomy days ofc i am, i’m not a psychopath :) :dawg: nah nah throwing the football around is where it’s at esp since im a terrible thrower :mmYea: lame fine then i’ll just sing like a dying goat sorry for being a dumb american y’all 😂😂 aren’t they like the same equal amount of intense? as in likelihood of concussions and shit? as far as i know ah oof even as an american, i still know jackshit about sports lol they definitely do if i needed proof, i’ll just listen to Shakira’s Waka-Waka lol the song was a bop tho ngl ~~only me~~ i

https://youtu.be/VyVLOdC8Qlw the last one had me rolling 😂 damn well glad i can end your day on a good note yes lucid dream it yup could never be me :e_minor: only way i can get a bizarre dream is if i actually get a good 8 hours even then i still couldn’t control the events but getting a full night’s sleep makes for spicy dreams for the most part yeah for me, the only way i know for sure if i’m getting enough sleep is if i wound up waking at least 2-3 times in the middle of the night after a crazy ass dream. where the scenario felt like hours had passed but i wake up and look at the clock, only 15-30 minutes had passed. it sounds a bit weird but that’s how my weird brain works kinda like sitting through a short film, if that’s how else i can explain it oh yeah defo. i’ve also had dreams that resulted from some scenario i think up inside my head as i’m lying on my pillow staring at the ceiling right before i close my eyes ya, me teleporting into one of my favorite video game worlds and just exploring the possibilities of it the mind is truly a powerful weapon taking a pop quiz on my phone hits different but i defo aced it. it was for extra credit anyway and my class score is

valid anyway watcha up to rn? yeah this server consists of people from all different timezones so we’re all either asleep, working, or schooling i’m getting ready to drive to school today it’s 7 AM so i had to wake up an hour early just to get ready yup! my school has been open back up to in-person classes for weeks now and i’m glad tbh. i learn so much better in-person than in virtual thank you! :bigmood: oof good luck :e_minor: frfr not my classmate falling asleep and snoring loud af 😭 good thing the students around him came in clutch and woke him up before the professor noticed rip for me, midterms depend on both semester and the professor. they tend to things differently and not everyone does the exact same education plan yup damn facebook owning all those entities. when they go down, everything else goes down it’s only ever active when we have something interesting to discuss lol or if we’re roasting each other :PinguDab: god i hope not REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 🕯 capitalism baby .cowsay Deal! gl Lu .cowsay It was no picnic for me either, punk ass :pleb: lmao lol funny thing is Insta disabled being able to see other people’s likes in order to boost self esteem Twitter is my most used app and they’re still alive and kickin Insta and Facebook could never lol im loving all these social media memes i only talk to like 1-2 people still on Whatsapp lol he can go Zucc himself at times lol i got bored with it after like a day :hoopla: ||https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease|| oh jesus better spoiler tag that hope he has a complete recovery if only :hoopla: but better late than never i suppose it was always such an annoying habit. competing with one another for more likes. and everyone including myself fell into the trap then i graduated high school, unfollowed everybody who never really cared about me so i finally woke up like damn, i used to care about their opinions even Twitter has its bad moments as Max Black said from 2 Broke Girls, “Twitter is stupid and Instagram is Twitter for people who can’t read” 😂 my favorite show and yet we can’t stop sending each other those videos lmao it’s the way the USA almost banned TikTok during the Trump admin Twitter is just more relatable i got bored with TikTok after a day 😂 i only ever “view” Tiktok videos when they’re reposted elsewhere like YouTube and Twitter oh dear god Logan Paul and whatever else his name was or was it Jake i don’t fucking know lmao facts inb4 they make a Discord version of the movie Unfriended 💀 and that’s why the term “children are our future” has been associated with a doomed society lmao in a nutshell only TikToks i genuinely enjoy are the ones with cute animals who dat? what he post? O me remembering the days when Instagram was only used to post food and drink pics and now that has shifted over to Snapchat kk me tapping rapidly through the instagram stories lmao but i watch my friends’ snapchat stories fully i loved the dog filters lol god when i would just sit in a high school classroom and play around with the filters during free time and my classmates would photobomb me and now we both had the dog filters on. those were wholesome moments oop oh yeah asdfghjkl the filter would just attach to a random object in the corner of your camera like oh shit, something’s watching me from behind Pokémon Go suddenly gained popularity even with the non gamers when i was in high school. people were walking around ||discovering dead bodies|| wild times bathroom pokémon Talking Angela freaked me out ngl but yeah it happened here too me neither xd Talking Tom tho avoided all the controversy yes the era of Talking Angela and Tom was when i was addicted to the more mainstream apps like Angry Birds, Subway Surfers, and Temple Run right? :e_minor: time flies when you’re having self-isolation (: OH GOD DO Y’ALL REMEMBER WHEN PEOPLE DESTROYED THEIR PHONES OVER FLAPPY BIRD?!?!

In other words, the implication is that answer choice C is correct more often than any other answer choice. >:) gnarly and now B is hopping aboard the "Let's Make Aku Anxious" train lmao lol ayyy PhotoMath clutch af +Aku whats new?

pointless if you ask me but money money money 🗿 fr mad disappointed that we don’t get a four day weekend from classes. campus was closed on veterans day today but i still gotta go to my friday class tomorrow ah the wonderful world of cancel culture and gullible viewers the people of the internet have truly lost brain cells if they can’t even separate the actor/actress from the character it’s always been like that for iphone users welp same thing for iphones and anyway the same goes for video game characters once again actors/actresses are not their characters lmfao leave these people alone to breathe and to live i don’t like Abby from TLOU2 but i’m not gonna send her actress hate. why? because it’s all fiction. a bunch of pixels put together by a computer i also don’t like Angela Robinson’s character in The Haves and the Have Nots because she’s a raging homophobe but irl? Angela is an ally for the LGBTQ+ movement and i stan that queen shit. the fact that i hate the homophobic character she plays means she’s doing a very good job at portraying the character that’s literally it got into one of my essay rants there for a sec lmao but my point stands. if you can’t separate the actor from the character, then you’re headed for big trouble down the road if you continue to fail to separate fiction from reality dogs are the best judges of character after all @kyo IM TRYING OUT VC ON ROBLOX FOR THE FIRST TIME AND ALREADY PEOPLE NOTICE I SOUND LIKE JAMES CHARLES, I HATE IT HERE LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THEY DID I HATE IT HERE rip yeah there's a whole extensive process but its actually not that complicated yay, now we can listen to little underage squeakers blurt out slurs and abuse their voice changers i shit you not, i’ve heard at least 2-3 N-words and F-words last night :shijudge: gotta eat lunch and do my afternoon chores first so probably not until mid afternoon or so accurate 😂 hells yes that’s therapeutic to me :pusheenheart: nah, got lunch and church this afternoon yup :this_is_fine: yeah i was born and raised in a catholic family nah i never was it’s all good nah i’m not forced or anything. i just roll with it i don’t read every single page of the Bible if that’s what you’re referring to. in fact, i make sure my whole life doesn’t revolve around it considering it’s heavily re-edited again and again throughout the centuries i guess that as liberal as i am, i still want to believe in some higher power that watches over my family in our darkest times. i’m not like hardcore born-again religious but i do still keep an open mind yeah i’ve been spending a lot of time with liberal atheists lol but all that aside, religion does play a role in my life, just not a *huge* one i don’t let it control who i become friends with or what i do or say since i’m catholic, we’re more focused on the Rosary and the Virgin Mary Christianity doesn’t care for the Rosary nah you’re good. i’m happy to discuss this yeah well that just shows how little i know and how far i still need to go to be fully informed i never said i was perfect but i’m just going with the flow atm nevertheless, it’s just there existing in my life. i have a cousin who’s in a similar scenario as me. we both grew up in heavily catholic households but she likes to drink occasionally, vapes, and parties wildly from time to time. she doesn’t attend every single mass when it comes to the relatives she’s fond of like our grandparents, she’ll express her faith. we both bond over the fact that we’re both deviating from what our parents used to teach us lol https://www.tiktok.com/@trishrubyjane/video/7028672728651615493?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESPgo8L9eQtLXg6KvLTL%2BZm59AvrtYGE3I76J55itBEKCSm7pr3jtKhHEHv%2FXbaR81QTq93XWXssyxTCwskiajGgA%3D&checksum=8411c2138de98ea482ff1f07520e6101c49f13c7ce9fa03d9343c9862056c5d3&clips_cover_ab=v4&enable_clips=1&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZQBjfrHJrOgU7Y1QMXl77nko9Pba2XX3D-r9AOPItlbIbrQ_6lVeJUI1GFC3aWSp&share_app_id=1233&share_item_id=7028672728651615493&share_link_id=1E494701-E206-4DBB-A246-4FB83E4F42BB&source=h5_m&timestamp=1636578228&tt_from=sms&u_code=dd6b9jih1m5f3j&user_id=6843553135059977221&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=sms&_r=1 this TikTok kinda sums it up how long until after the snap is sent does it notify you? or is it immediate? oh damn i’m wondering if people actually complained/joked about being left on Delivered so much that SC actually decided to do something about it lol i used to play the trombone in elementary school but got bored after a year lol 10 year old me really tried to lug that heavy ass thing around if you want, have fun! it was pretty easy to learn. i remember being the literal only trombone player in the entire band so there was the pressure lol i thought for sure it was gonna involve french kissing in some way, shape or form 🤔 ||french horn-y|| :Bbay: hello custody agreement dad how's it hanging 🫂 so how has life been treating ya?

jesus aku you made it sound like it’s a medical emergency 💀💀 but animals are actually pretty forgiving. i’ve had my fair share of moments letting my dog down on the floor in the most wrong and extreme ways by accident. he forgives me easily almost always idk about cats, but i wouldn’t worry about it you know the saying, “cats always land on their feet?” signifying that they’re perfectly capable of handling themselves? i wouldn’t worry about it Aku pets are our children once you give them food, water, and love, they’re fine exactly that’s a good sign then they’re more resilient than you give them credit for you’re doing great Aku LMAO don’t let our experiences stop you good practice ooh a story 👀 best of luck Aku 🤞🏼 see?

😭😭 ASDFGHJKL dogs are only meant to hump other dogs and inanimate objects. they should not be watching two humans doing the same thing :e_minor: it is indeed considerate <.< >.> lmao i thought i read that correct the first time 💀 the poor meow meow witnessing another meow meow :PinguDab: sneezy you cant really. they're just in their own separate tab. you can always choose to ignore it but you can stop them from automatically playing there should be an option in Settings i spot a wild Viv in the corner, looking pretty while watching her hot bf work out does he ever lift you tho? 👀 my area has been enjoying some 50s. and a chilling rainy day every so often. thats our winter weather do you wear socks? oh i see lmao love that emote https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant_gift_exchange inch resting not dirty at all sounds wholesome lmao 👀 oop lmao exactly like the conversations you'd have with Rae head and shoulders gang mhm one towel for everything one shower per day smort anyway damn, realized ive been doing it wrong this whole time. been showering once a day, washing my hair as well, and not even caring that much to see hairs on my pillowcase 😂  oh well. i still go out every day and people make fun of my bowl cut either way :Bbay: *go out and buy head and shoulders shampoo, its good for the dandruff* samsies mine never makes any comments to begin with. i just let my hair do its thing lol oop yeah i wouldnt go *that* far with the DIY :jebus: in my experience and from what ive witnessed as an adult, children are easily overwhelmed when doing something completely out of the ordinary its new, its foreign, its strange, its different, any of those things could make a kid burst into tears they're just built emotionally different i suppose 💀 mhm could also depend on how much they were coddled due to specific parenting skills like my dad still keeps a home video of Toddler Me crying while sitting on top of his computer desk for no apparent reason and i get secondhand embarrassment every time i watch it lmao it was so out of context, which makes it even better https://tenor.com/view/inside-out-joy-cry-crying-tears-gif-4763726 my parents never had me believe in Santa, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny, or anyone else for that matter lol my childhood consisted of wishing they were real after living vicariously through my cartoons 💀 yay! now brace yourself for the following day and side effects. take it easy, yeah? i totally get what you mean. my parents can never understand that i have a social battery and it does drain fast when i’m with a group of people for too long. does not mean i’m anti-social, just means i like to occasionally hang with friends and sometimes family but eventually, i’ll want to go home early. over time and with patience, my dad came to be understanding. mom on the other hand, not so much. give it time. it’s ok to be an introvert and it’s perfectly fine to take break from socializing for me personally, it was due to failed attempts at trying to be outgoing throughout elementary school but after a whole lot of "I wasnt talking to you" or "that joke really isnt that funny, idk why you're still laughing." i just said fuck it, come middle school, just kept to myself and earned my own reputation with my teachers where im the most quiet but could stand to talk more in class. i was like nah. from that point on, earbuds on in public always, letting people know to not expect a response from me damn :/ lol this is why "i hate people" is such a mood these days yeah no completely understandable. i was also used to pass assignments in school. after high school, i realized who i was even trying to kid anymore. unfollowed a whole bunch of people on social media who never gave a rat's ass about me so why should I? its so healthy school will unfortunately be one of many places where your peers will always try and take advantage of you its usually best to just keep your eyes elsewhere anyway. i avoid eye contact just for people to not talk to me never give them a second glance thank god for masks you no longer have to pretend to smile dont forget the permanent resting bitch face 😂 :bigmood: sup bestie pretty good hbu? 🫂 https://youtu.be/dO61A4suY_0 @azula :PinguDab: random cute guy: *compliments me on my jacket in the Costco parking lot*

Noemi is of French origin yeah when people think Asia in general, they think China and its annoying those rolls :0 WINNIE THE POOH TRY AND CENSOR US NOW no. if i remember correctly, the first thing they noticed when looking at me was my western clothes which is obvious since my mom bought my entire wardrobe growing up. to them, i look somewhat upper-class, but they were just average clothes from your local Ross Dress for Less weird because my dad and his family and friends embraced a lot of the Western music and culture that were introduced when he was growing up in Saigon his music taste today was shaped by groups such as The Rolling Stones i remember taking swim lessons in Ho Chi Minh City and some Viet kids instantly recognized i was speaking English so they spoke it back to me after i introduced myself being from the US we were visiting my grandparents for 2-3 weeks hdklasgdklasd show that thumbnail is already not promising 💀 fucking Duterte oh damn, im just now realizing multicultural af lmao y'all are truly chaotic DUG YAWA omg lmao wondering if its a coincidence they named the automatic vacuum cleaner Roomba lol one week break off from school before spring semester commences, hbu? felt those “too good to be true” moments are oddly painful wait everything is going my way for once. where’s the catch? but i wouldn’t take it too seriously. don’t look a gift horse in the mouth and just embrace that you have free time after the workload is finished quickly burn the bridge when you cross it ooh yay! hope everything goes your way like last time keep your fingers crossed wassup just had pho for dinner, gonna kick back and relax for the rest of the evening, enjoying the remaining of this fine V-Day hope you and Jon had a lovely one btw! because soulmates :aww: time truly goes by fast it does when you’ve been having fun do it loving gesture awie well yeah. it’s a bootyful voice you will perish in compliments and love and you WILL like it :ferretoblush: lol i’m skimming and i can tell 😂 go #platinum babe ✨✨ rooting for you :forglove: rip Mother Nature cant make up her mind, again i had to look at this for half an hour lmao damn Discord outage on both PC and mobile :e_minor: not even kidding, this was in my neighborhood lmao welcome back Lu probably army memes and work stuff lmao true why so serious 👁️👄👁️ damn you are lucky indeed i dont miss chem lmao ah 2020 spring semester, bought a lab coat and goggles and everything only for school to become virtual and my money's worth was wasted for virtual labs :e_minor: nah it worked out in the end. got to use them for Human Anatomy lab instead breeding your dog? where on earth did they get that assumption?? what was the advice you were asking for? wow, so they read the phrase "my dog is pregnant" and really jumped to conclusions that you're trying to create a whole new hybrid breed :shijudge: honestly people always assume the worst before actually knowing the facts do they not know that some owners have two dogs of the same breed and their animal instincts kick in, with or without the owner's interference?? jesus accident or not, whats done is done. human activities done with dogs such as pregnancy terminations and vegan diets are just wrong trust me we are absolutely not all like that. there are those few that do own dogs but act all snobby and high-and-mighty about it. the worst kind just lets them poop on random people's yards and dont even clean up after them. then they cry victim when the property owner gets mad at them for not doing the common sense thing and CLEAN UP after their dogs but to assume you're performing some breeding project after you asked them a simple question about vitamins tells me they have rotten attitudes and that nobody should be coming to *them* for advice about dogs sorry you had to meet those people. the social justice extremism can be taken too far in scenarios such as this one like as long as you're not purposely harming them, they should leave you alone oh for sure. they think they can get away with everything and make up excuses for their dogs just so they wont take responsibility for if and when the dogs make a mistake or did something wrong that they themselves cant comprehend lmao i cringe at parents trying to tell each other how to do things their own way there's self-help books and then there's "no no no, you're doing it wrong! dont let your babies get piercings too early!" smh time to go grocery shopping with dababy alexa play congratulations lol cute gnarly :shijudge: what did you do exactly btw to scare her? ah i see :OOF: thank goodness tomorrow is no school for Presidents Day damn best of luck, dont cram too hard oh god it’s one of those profiles @Weiss jesus christ @Weiss thank god thanks Weiss thank you mods scam bot with a scam link bogus Nitro gifts in every single channel my phone actually blew up at around 8 in the morning :jebus: been a while since i had a three hour gap in between classes and taking a nap in my car was absolutely refreshing lmao, that’s already me but i’m sitting at an outdoor table of my school’s cafe and i’ve laid out my binder and papers and everything but im just scrolling through my phone 💀 magic mystery 🫂 me m _ _ :shijudge: lmao my professors have had enough of the "I agree" responses people would often whip up on the spot 😂 oh really? in general or just in class discussions? oh i had a friend who dealt with an anti-vaxxer in a discussion post and both my friend and the professor were not having it at the time and i am indeed guilty of "I agree" posts. back before the days of Zoom University yeesh enjoy your ride Viv was just scrolling through ATLA Twitter and i finally recognized  where your pfp was from lol 😂 yes what movie was it?

like where do you guys go to check rules and guidelines regarding both students and staff? that whole thing where your teacher absolutely "needs" to see what your family look like really crosses a line to me weird. in the US, they're among the first books you receive during orientation well by the time you get to college, you get the choice to pick one up in-person xd yeah my school has both a virtual one and hardcover one :shijudge: so then how does your school expect the students and staff to behave? :WTFthonk: or are they the kind of institution that assumes all of you guys know common sense so y'all already know from right to wrong cause i feel like there should be boundaries that shouldnt be crossed, and that includes personal photos yeah idk, but bottom line, there should be established do's and don'ts at your school yeah, that would be best i honestly dont see a reason why your teacher feels the need to run *further* background checks as if you're being interrogated like all she needs to do is teach you? literally lol i hope you get everything resolved soon Ahmed. you really dont deserve all that stress :shijudge: "but dad, it really did take me by surprise!" valid valid you cant spell Sushi without sus my mom is a manicurist so she definitely made sure to teach me the basics of just trimming my unruly claws lmao but yeah its basic hygiene as someone who had to learn on his own how to scan every homework assignment for Canvas during Zoom Uni, this is a travesty oop, i used the actual scanner that came with my computer's printer. way easier to use than on a phone personally damn a whole ass assembly just for a personal hygiene inspection fair fair ayo same :e_minor: welp did you not talk to a counselor beforehand?

A nevus is usually dark and may be raised from the skin. Also called mole. i have plenty of moles on my arms and i just lived with them here's something There are several reasons why adults may develop a mole later in life. These causes include: Hormonal Changes. We all know that women’s bodies change dramatically during pregnancy and menopause, and these changes can also include changes to the skin. Increasing Age. The older a patient is, the more likely they are to develop a new mole. i deadass have a mole right next to my nose and my best friend told me its shaped like a Christmas tree and since then, i can never unsee it 💀 because i looked in the mirror and it is indeed shaped like a pine tree lmao omg i vaguely remember that apparently it has a history we all just be knighting our children without the Queen’s ceremony huh? i almost want to believe that name is an inside joke that combines “Fresh and Delicious” iirc there’s a drink with that slogan 💀 oh dear god 💀💀 idk if this counts but i once had a neighbor whose dog was named Clue (inspiration from Pink Panther) i thought it was a cool name i also had an English teacher whose two dogs are named Buddy Bear and Sancho. Sancho is the hyperactive one and Buddy Bear is a literal cuddle buddy. i loved them both whenever my teacher brought them to school oh cute! ooh what were they? ooh cute names! glad that they’re going to good families and homes nah my neighbor just loved Pink Panther since it happens to originate from comedy/mystery films with that French police detective it had more to do with the fact that my neighbor was an old woman with adult children so Pink Panther was for their generation and Blue’s Clues caters to the younger generation same as of right now. imma sleep good tonight what what what cool almost 6:30 in the morning i have class at 8 and i wanna arrive early to get good parking lol but first, breakfast ugh i wish. we ran out and i forgot to buy some 😭 so imma make myself a sandwich or a bowl of cereal or sum Honey Nut Cheerios. my favorite you *would* emphasize that part 😂 cereal before milk. what am i, an animal? ugh break me in half soggy cereal yum literally. i see any guy whose arms even remotely fill up their shirt sleeve, they can choke me and id say thank you 💀💀 ayyy chillin oh no :shijudge: ShiJudge turned into ShiShame the way i'd be happy i get to learn history in a near empty space LMAO jealousy level is spot on 😂 horny level tho 🤔 i relate on the "didnt do the math right" man its that time of the semester huh? when you finally bother to look around you and realize that half the class dropped out 6, 8, 10 people including yourself in a room #art-channel cool story bro apparently i have an old classmate somewhere out there and i came here from my birthplace and i mean yeah my hometown is a lil boring but we got wild animals digging in our garbage every once in a while so it gets a little exciting. it’s not something to be angry about :( wait, what of mine is itchy? there’s my hand eczema 😭 these random texts are just more amusing than frightening lmao tis a mystery ye thanks Viv @azula i really love this poll design! very cool! happy birthday eve! :dopeystarey: oh wait its friday lmao well then happy birthday eve eve saved it :Bbay: @red hot silly pepper yooo congratulations!!!!! 🥳 https://tenor.com/view/yay-congrats-congratulations-happy-baby-yoda-gif-21343114 sleep Viv congrats!!!! so cute! 🥺 i just stink period hey bestie, loving the profile upgrade Endless Summer is really good diamond heavy tho that’s why people prefer to mod ye. the artwork is also different than the mainstream so you can try and get used to it, see if you like it understandable i suppose but i personally loved that they did different art for Endless Summer and Hero Veil of Secrets hbu, so far? both are good well OH1 was good, 2 and 3 are questionable lmao TE was decent but ending was rushed might wanna spoiler tag that for those that haven’t read it yet whichever you prefer ive seen quite the opposite.
