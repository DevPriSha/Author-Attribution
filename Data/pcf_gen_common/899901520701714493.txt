cos- adjacent/hypotenuse
tan- opposite/adjacent s for sine
c for cos
t for tan o for opposite
a for adjacent
h for hypotenuse ye sec is just flipping cos remember SC cot has a t so it should be for tan so that leaves cosec for sine you just need to know sin cos and tan the other 3 you can easily get ehhhh the applications are pretty fun hehe pray to the trig gods  theres a higher chance of you succeeding by praying to the trig gods than asking the ground to swallow you i mean have you read courtesean of rome? :this_is_fine: if you are not taking science in future then you dont need these after this year @Akuna Matata ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ im pretty suure or i maybe wrong but idk less chance :aww: ah shit you want to or is someone making you take? calculus in simple language can be said as approximation i guess like you can use calculus to find the area of an irregular shape or the area under a graph  or you can use calculus to find the square root of 0.069 without a calculator xD  ah that means you havent reached calculus yet calculus is hard but it is fun once you understand xD gn :e_minor: delet these so that viv doesnt ban   :caticon: she might not after seeing this this will deffo catch her attention lul https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/838122592417087528.gif?size=128 heard of it but havent played it i seee 7777777777777 ded chat Kali is known as the goddess of death and destruction  which exam tomorrow? poor guys will have 2 board exams from now  FFFFFFFFFF they made this as a new rule  i mean idk how to explain what is board exam its like a final exam conducted from the education board and not by the school oh even this is 3 hrs long hmm ours is out of 500 like each subject 100 marks and we have 5 of them this is for 12th grade i dont remember 10th hmm wots that ohk idk about ours coz i didnt apply for foreign uni Good luck for tomorrow! Just know that 10th board marks won't matter in future (it's just family prestige) And once sst is over a lot of stress would go off I would say you have a pretty good schedule Sst + maths>>>> maths I've never ever heard a student who said I'm comfortable with sst till now  Ah that's bad, 1 day for maths is too less Yup, those who are good at memorizing gets good marks @Akuna Matata for maths I would suggest you to first revise only the topics you are "most uncomfortable" with, and after that just keep doing sample papers And by doing sample papers I mean just go through the questions If you feel you might not be able to do a question then try solving that Because it's not possible to do 3 hr sample papers now I don't think you would have a choice because syllabus is very big and time is too less Hullo Gn Geometry, trig, statistics, algebra This is in her grade I think I must have missed something @Akuna Matata  @  when I was in 10th grade, maths was my last exam and it went good and I came home and then we got the news that maths paper got leaked so there might be a re examination  Oof There was a re examination but thankfully not in my region It happened around delhi region Coz aku has only 1 day for maths! Damn That's a lot of leaks :mmYea: Here 12th grade board marks is pretty important But 10th grade is useless Idk why we even have it Maybe I'm addicted to this song called jugnu by badshah Ah I generally was never a fan of badsha's songs but I'm addicted to this one Plus the choreography is also sick There's this #jugnuchallenge also on insta and youtube Mhm another source of ammunition for desi moms   I think this is the best way to remember  I do the same But the brain drain makes it really sad lol niice mines starting before new years eve  :this_is_fine: thx https://www.instagram.com/evincism/reel/CXthVvCp5PC/?utm_medium=copy_link FORG'S BROTHER it happened to me once while eating burger :LMFAOdead: Burgers are big  it was a double decker burger nope oof people who havent got covid by now are the real legends daamn stay safe! luckily nothing terrible happened to me in 2020 and 21 just 2 very boring years spent almost doing nothing oof same im more of an indoor guy anyway so lockdowns never really affected me unlike some of my friends happy new year from India!

Ye We all are secretly Africans  Hazel Nguyen  Hmm I'm Bengali only Ye gurung sounds like a sino Tibetan surname :LMFAOdead: Do you think Aryan invasion theory is true? Food also  It's basically like in the beginning indians were all Dravidians and then Aryans came from the north and drove out the Dravidians to the south Now most people of South India are of Dravidian ancestry and that of North(including pak afg etc) are aryans That's called Ganesh And Dravidians are mostly dark skinned and Aryans are mostly light skinned There's so much to Hinduism even hindus don't know Ye I remember learning it in school i think  I have no idea And then there's a myth in kashmir that European ladies come to this village to mate with pure blooded Aryans So that they get pure blooded aryan offspring? It's called pregnancy tourism or some thing You'll need a lot of time to explore all of India though  https://youtu.be/_7dx6_jtaig See this Most Pakistanis and North Indian people are light skinned Emphasis on "most" A bit tanner than east Asians i suppose Idk what picture to show you  Yea ig You can see Punjabis or Kashmiris or pahadi people They are mostly light skinned Even north east indians have light skin Sheeesh If that's dark idk what's white :LMFAOdead: Mixed race sounds pretty good Filipino Both my parents are pure blooded Bengalis so I don't have any such problem  Lul You would pass as westerner if it weren't for black hair Ngl Coool Idk what I'm I'm something in between white and black How is COVID going on in your places We are having our third wave  How do you go from tan to white!
