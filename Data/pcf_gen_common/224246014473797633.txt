Ah yes asian families It’s always asian and Hispanic families that are huge I guess Though worldwide birth rates are going down Too far down in some. Japan, South Korea, and China with their one child policy Though they recently removed it I believe Yeah Oops I guess my wording was misleading sorry about that Well I’m not sure what their policies are now Yeah but the consequence was also they heavily preferred males So there’s a shortage of females The gender ratio is alarmingly high China has the most skewed ratio in the world It’s because males were the ones to carry on the family name Hence preference So if you could only have one child and it ended up being a girl... They uh.. handed them to an old lady who’d take care of it. The ratio is 1.15:1, aka 115:100 For boys to girls Here’s a small article I found on it:

Then, discuss how Durkheim would explain this." me, still trying to figure out what exactly division of labor and solidarity mean ok... i found the section in the textbook im still trying to think of an example the one i originally thought of involved parasite but im gonna save that for later because that movie will fit better with the social division unit but hmm kljdfl;kdjsfl;kdj parasite was such a masterpiece but im tryna find something that involves the division of labor which is specialized economic activity basically how specialization and people working at specific jobs boosts society but also is a part of why social classes are a thing mornin or i could do solidarity basically mechanical solidarity which was more common in hunter gatherer societies shared more of a collective consciousness since they all had similar jobs and thus were socially simular organic solidarity is where more modern societies fall under with people having more specialized jobs and thus having to rely on interdependence to survive they're different since they have different jobs and are less bound by the collective and tradition they rely on other people and their specializations basically the former roots in similarity and the other roots in differences you get it? cuz i get like 80% oh yeah and organic solidarity is where division of labor lies @Arzaylea I CANT THINK OF ANYTHING IN TODAY'S WORLD THAT CAN SHOW IT THAT INVOLVES POPULAR MEDIA within the last 5 years the only thing i can think of that involves specialization is... THE FUCKING CELLS AT WORK ANIME AND THEY'RE LITERALLY CELLS WITHIN A BODY You... *are* the society.

me: oh god not another one makes sense get ur roles back in #roles there's another viv catholic yes yes mental health is important hhhh gotta start preparing for my midterms soon this is an entire experience on its own. all you have missed is me crying in vc on a daily basis over my homework or at least crying internally it just be like dat im actively trying to get myself to watch my lectures. key word trying. :forg: it's ok im also pretending i didn't see rae's message anyways i dont see nuthin i hate this it's been 4 hours still not done with my first lecture 🤡 im eating !!! afterwards vc homie what did you even say kpop stans don't just.... do that unless they were provoked somehow some will but if you got an entire slew then 👀 may i ask what group. oh lawd one of them woulda been bad but BOTH OF THEM??? so... you saw a kpop video and then commented that you don't find the men attractive so you made a video saying you don't find them attractive YOU DID???? homie i don't think you're in the wrong but you don't seem to be in the right either you underestimate their power ok but if you made a video just to say you don't find kpop idols attractive this is on you homie tbh idk what you were expecting THEY CAN AND I CANNOT STRESS THAT FURTHER IDK WHAT POWER THEY HAVE ON THEIR SIDE BUT i thought of that too lmao :ConfusedCat: if i were you i'd delete that video and GO why soon homie 15 minutes of fame isn't worth that do you have any other socials connected to that tiktok account if so i seriously advise you to take them off bro they have your face that's all they need and whatever clues they can find on your other videos um usually i don't victim blame like i said but i actually disagree you... sorta did lay out the bait a trend to what just because it was a trend doesn't justify that video making a video that is based on something negative is only gonna do more harm than anything not too late to delete it xoxo i really cannot stress it further that they can and will do stuff you poked an entire wasp nest colony tay i loaf you and all but and im not even gonna sugar coat it that was stupid of you to do. personally i do not understand why you would make that kind of video in the first place things like that you should just keep to yourself people have said byebye to their jobs and college over tiktok just because it is a social media platform does not mean it ain't you behind it it's the false sense of hiding behind a mask if it makes its way back to you then i can only say sorry at most. dangerous. FAE WHAT U GOTTA SAY CMON I SEE U TYPIN @Arzaylea vc now? to add on to this point... if you have such a hatred for kpop enough to do that- i think you need to reevaluate why you don't like it in the first place. it is one thing to simply say "i don't like kpop." that is a fine opinion. but to go and actively invite hate by making a video like that in the first place not the wisest move my point stands on the last part why invite hate then if you do not like them that video says otherwise to me. if you don't care then you wouldn't even bother going out to film it caption it and then post it and then reply to the comments. and you are right- i am very concerned. LU VC OR NOT?? LMAO ok i will sit in vc.. and blast my dangerous playlist NO LU PUT ON YOUR FUCKING SEATBELT FIRST YEAH NOT WITHOUT A SEATBELT YOU AINT YOU BETTER DRIVE SAFE LU :YellingWoman: actually imma shower real quick too so lu please take your sweet sweet time Has lu arrived home yet In a safe fashion Does this mean I have an escape for tonight I mean I don’t think lu has an understudy so :pleb: :pleb: Nice Aju nice the stars Twinkle Oop It’s A catchy song.

I thought you were gonna go to bed O Well Give me a few minutes and I will go back to my pc The first trauma I can talk about but the relationship one is so deep rooted that not even my therapist knows about it yet And also I don’t even like talking about it and thus Prefer typing I told my therapist about that too She was like “Dw if anything like that were to happen id tell you” I have to ask As in like Professionals? Or Cuz I’ve said no I’m pretty sure to them cuz I was like The presence of another individual- Ah Nah I asked her if you could join since your therapist was going on maternity leave She said yes apparently Or at least not a no So If you ever wanna go to therapy with me- LOL You don’t pay it’s covered by my insurance/county :e_minor: Viv you don’t pay That’s pretty much the bottom line i would but i would probably clown you for something actually my therapy sessions are just me clowning myself half the time i am a test for my therapist to see if she can stay professional anyways i am at my pc now this is the ideal time to type out my wee lil traumas ~ therapy is me putting on a stand up comedy about myself. it's gonna be weird for you to be hearing my real name so often tho oop one day i will sit in on you screaming on zoom oh yeah viv my therapist is filipino she is a bilingual therapist english and tagalog wait rn? ok can i at least commentate via vc lurkers viv in therapy Fuck I never got around to discussing my trauma I’ll type out the first one aka why I had to Yeet during that one scene in the movie we watched but the other one I will have to talk about tomorrow since it is a lot to unpack and frankly I anticipate y’all will be ready to beat someone up And I know since Rae is in said line Oop Ok time to type this then Obvious tw warnings on ||death|| and somewhat graphic descriptions Actually not so obvious but I think y’all get the point So the reason why I had to leave during that scene in white chicks is At the time we were watching the movie, it use so happened to be right after the one year anniversary of ||one of my friends passing away in a car crash. One night, he and three of his friends were driving down a road when the driver lost control of the vehicle. They crashed into a tree and the car caught on fire. The only survivor was the driver who I expect now has to live with such extreme survivor’s guilt. Anyways, I also remember one of my friends mentioning that her brother was near the crash site when it happened and he could hear the driver screaming inside the vehicle. Honestly, I just hope the other three ended up dying on impact and didn’t survive long enough to feel the fire consume them.|| Usually I’m more or less okay with things like that now but for a while after I was terrified of getting behind the wheel. And going faster speeds still gives me a bit of anxiety unfortunately. So yeah seeing that scene in white chicks rlly got me :e_minor: I miss him. He would’ve turned 20 last December. Couldn’t even attend any service due to Restrictions. One of the saddest things I’ve ever seen is ||his grandparents having to say their eulogy at their grandson’s funeral.|| I can’t imagine the pain of having to go through that Anyways still hate driving xoxo Yeah This is the sad one The relationship trauma I will go over tomorrow Oboi!!! I still get a tinge of pain every time I drive by where it happened Hellooo Unfortunately you’ve caught us in a deep talk Usually it’s might lighter I can assure you Much* Yeah and I’ll never shake the part where one of the victims was the driver’s own boyfriend She just It’s a lot of stress and burden. the guilt and pain. I understand everyone’s condolences but this doesn’t mean I’m accepting hugs :e_minor: :e_minor: :pleb: :elmofire: Never... See what I’m going to talk about later is so messy I can’t even construct a timeline for it anymore because I simply cannot remember That’s only one layer Ew what’s this fluffy feeling I have There’s more No No Do I have to add you to the list of people to strangle across a screen We are the same size square up Man Y’all are gonna do such a 180 when I talk about my ex next It’s been almost two years and I still have issues stemming from it <3 Get in line behind @red hot silly pepper I mean y’all were already ready to jump when I mentioned that i was ghosted for a solid month and that was just one part of it I don’t want to talk about that part I really want to time travel and punt myself Anyways the ghosting part I consider One of the less “oh” parts so :forg: Oop Goodnight lu Get your uh Virtual fists ready I guess But in the end I don’t hate my ex. Manifest negative COVID test Well we aren’t friends so Peace None of my real life friends know Aside from maybe like one or two at best Bad idea they would square up Anyways I’m going to sleep now and flex on lu for being able to :elmofire: Goodnight Whrore NOOOOO you silly goose.

Is this y’all with me :e_minor: They also look at what you do outside of school Not surprised you can think of it as UCs are more towards STEM while CSUs are more arts and humanities Both are fine tho it’s just about which one is better for you My mom yelling at me because she forgot where the location was Like What do I have to do with this My job interview I referenced a store we both go to occasionally And she’s like Why didn’t you tell me to turn this or what way like I THOUGHT YOU KNEW A DIFFERENT ROUTE Immigrant parents rlly at it and yelling at you for their mistakes :e_minor: I’m back homies Ur boi Has a job now :elmofire: $15/hr too Dishwashing is hard but I literally have like Bouts of energy I need to get out somehow so Plus cleaning is soothing Unless my ocd decides to not make it Part time Full time plus college is Ouch The power of ironyyyyyy It’s continuously losing your mother at the store because she keeps going off somewhere everytime she says we’re gonna go to pay :e_minor: The anxiety of waiting for your mom to get that last thing she suddenly remembered And the line keeps inching closer and closer I bring my wallet but like MOM I DONT HAVE THE FUNDS TO FULLY PAY- Oop forg n todd Yes Double employment power $15/hr bbyyy On site https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeShB4yS/ Tw: prince Philip This is funny How much you making Also where were you hired hahaha 69 o viv and i made the same joke damn. i didn't even read viv's reply beforehand smh downloading the sims 4 off of rae's account again lol there's this thing i can't get out of my head i'll draw it in ms paint to show yall because i wanna see how it would actually look in a house ok so if you have rooms that share walls and you want to put shelves there, it would look like on the left but what if you built the wall around the shelves. so they would be flush against the "wall" per say and the room itself would look more open like do yall get what i mean i swear i saw this in a dream or something and then i woke up and was like ...wait a damn minute yes... probably i also remember playing the og rhs and there was no second story in there so i remember like artificially building a second floor at one point roblox high school but like there's only so much floor room so i was like well time to use the y axis yes yes but i can't stop thinking about it lmao that's robloxian high school wait a damn minute if omg i can go in there and rebuild my dorm i forgot what it looked like time to see what middle school kyo's interior design craft was like update the dorms are gone :e_minor: it's houses again ample opportunity but eh the sims exists good enough gotta cheat my way to unlock the exclusive furniture tho lol what huh viv i hope you're ok but we can't exactly help or know what to do if we don't exactly know what's going on are you ok do you feel safe ah :ConfusedCat: you know what suddenly i hope you perish. guys who's gonna sit around the story time corner as i recall my last relationship ✨ :e_minor: what blanket are you bringing oop see the only thing is it's more gonna be like a bullet point list because i can't even remember the order of things that messy. yes if only the pain was like that just like me. i don't even remember where she lives her cat had a hitler stache though i remember making a comment about it lol viv this is why you're in therapy for this that's one way to put it i guess my favorite part will be when lu finally reads it that would mean i would have to physically go through my contacts to find her. unfortunately. i still get a sense of fight or flight everytime i even *see* someone who remotely resembles her so no oop what are you working on per say it's me stalling a story time i set up myself for me. answer my question first also im still thinking of what parts im gonna have to like spoiler tag/censor oh yeah you were on the news for it is it ok if i permanently make that fact a part of my comedy routine on you ok noted https://tenor.com/view/crash-cars-race-flip-gif-16355316 @red hot silly pepper kachow. it's funnier when no one else has the context sorry rae ish sorry yall im just tryna get my nerves out it's hard!!! literally like i don't know if i've ever talked about it with anyone BUT rae i think i have with like a very limited amount of irl friends but otherwise it's still a secret in a sense because internally i feel a sense of shame. i mean yeah it took me like a solid year+ to finally settle in that it is trauma im im not forcing myself dont worry i feel like i have to talk about it in order for me to actually move on wait viv's THOSE FUCKING TAROT CARDS- ahem anyways your tarot reading referenced that i had to let go/move on from something iirc but anyways yeah i've been holding onto it for almost 2 years now and it's constricting because dealing with it mostly by myself gets hard a lot yes idk what that means but yes bby was upside down too i think the only way i can tell is through a literal series of bullet points cuz as i said i have zero timeline for this anymore so plus it'll be easier for me to spoiler tag since i'll just tag the entire message alrighty time to type away TW ON ... quite a few things *cracks knuckles* in no particular order ... if u want ||- alright so one of the primary things i remember is being constantly pushed past my level of comfort in terms of emotional boundaries. she always said she needed validation which i was ok with but it escalated to her literally yelling at me if i didn't say i love you at the end of a phone call or something- to which me saying that in general in itself is hard for me to do since well.. im me
- it's the emotional exhaustion for me from feeling like i was literally doing gymnastics in this relationship
- at one point she ended up running away from her home and the police literally came to my house at 3am because they thought she went to my house. she didn't. at all.
- anyways the next day she called me via and refused to tell me where she was which was like wtf to me but anyways i ended up literally sprinting to my school's police officer to see if the call could be traced but it couldn't
- i was first dumped while in the middle of english class. the next day she called me in tears and asked if we could pretend that part never happened and hahah i gave in
- like i said before, i got ghosted for literally a solid month at one point too so...
- her final dump was her calling me and yelling at me for prioritizing my grades over her; it was FINALS week
- also she called me an asshole that very call <3
- oh yeah turns out she cheated on me like twice and the second time she even uh... haha. anyways she literally texted me with "i didn't cheat on you with oliver" to which i was like... "who's oliver" ??? i still have no idea who oliver is
- it's also her dming me like half a year later saying she missed me and that i probably hated her and blah blah blah. i told her i didn't hate her but that some things shouldn't be touched
- speaking of touching i remember telling her i was ace and she literally like... degraded me over it? and then the next day she called and said she didn't remember doing such a thing to which... huh.|| hmm if i remember some more stuff i'll say it but this is all i can remember so far and to note this took in the time span of like a few months at most i still feel like it was my fault somehow for being roped into this even though logic says i shouldn't i know it isn't but sigh oh wait just remembered something: ||after she got found from running away she for some reason yelled at me for not trying to help the people find her but in reality i just never told her about what i did teehee|| Wait fun fact but actually really sad fact that still impairs me: ||she explicitly told me that I don’t show any affection at one point|| Im still In scrambles over that statement That’s one way to put it I was planning on breaking up but didnt know when But then she did it for me Lol I remember just Laughing afterwards. Anyways wonder when lu will read this and sharpen her chanclas Still adding to this I know it’s technically not right but I can’t help but wonder if it’s true sometimes. I don’t even remember what I said I just remembered the smooth paper I think it’s a Words vs actions thing tho In terms of love languages per say And how you show affection Yeah I think I told y’all about it when it happened Cuz I was like :ConfusedCat: Oh my god Right Right... Me looking straight at the red flags and being like Oh well :e_minor: :e_minor: :e_minor: :e_minor: :YellingWoman: :ConfusedCat: WHY Sigh It’s probably a good thing I don’t remember much. Forg Todd You know I think my New manager’s name is Todd lol Anyways I wonder what lu will say to this I’m honestly looking for her reaction the most for some reason Then again this is my first time telling this to like Anyone not Rae To the full extent She still has my orchestra zip up jacket which I actually really liked :e_minor: Oh well I can just buy another one eventually Part of me is still in such a weird state that it’s like What if This is just an exaggeration I don’t know anymore Viv how many forg images do you have If you scroll up to the big block if spoiler tagged text you can find out voltra Only if you want tho Since it is Of that nature Nah I posted it a few minutes ago This Yeah that’s ok It can be summarized as A roller coaster :elmofire: Oop I feel inferior to myself without my consent Penguin Wait I just remembered something This is 100% going to enrage yall further ||One time she basically tried manipulating me and almost tried forcing herself onto me|| It’s the near guilt trip for me!!!! Get in line folks... I mean I wouldn’t but I don’t know anymore Oh right she had a rebound after me And I saw on her story and I was like Huh Another Asian person Funny Viv at her physical therapy with ongoing rage How is it going Look I’m only sorry for my future partner who is unfortunately going to have to deal with my emotional baggage Oboi. Viv’s new motivation for physical therapy is so she can clock a bitch out It’s me realizing that I like playing games with romance in it is because it’s a coping mechanism Me realizing I use games like lovelink and other VNs as a coping mechanism :e_minor: :ConfusedCat: So I can feel singing Something Ha Haha See I knew that me talking about my ex gf would make y’all line up I was absolutely correct Hmm I guess I do feel a bit better now Knowing maybe it really wasn’t me. Why hello drew welcome to the story time corner I inferred Man My head hurts now Lame I can’t seem to. It’s karma from tryna flex on lu yesterday Lmao Right I have to get shoes for my job Rae I know you did choir but I don’t think I can take you singing seriously Anyways time to find nonslip shoes that also have some sort of orthopedic support My only fear is if my OCD decides to say “no <3” You don’t know? It’s you That’s exactly why I said no Anyways still I probably have to mention my ocd at one point As long as I don’t like Explicitly touch anything it should be fine Aka gloves Long gloves. Yes I am a sanitary specialist! Aka dishwasher. Ok sleep gn So Anyone care to explain. Look I already woke up to fruit punch rolling down my forehead so NOT LITERAL FRUIT PUNCH I’m talking about red people liquid Anyways I’m Um Haha At this point maybe Not everyday you look in the mirror and it’s like Ah Didn’t know I got that vampire face mask thing Suddenly I’m not sleeping anymore.

Y’all have? ￼ Any of y’all wanna vc in a bit I have a whole 90 minutes to myself today lol Until like after my orientation But idk how long that’ll take rip chickens Alright you can calm down with those types of jokes now. yay ? 2 hours til what Due to the nature of that kind of subject it is extremely inappropriate to attempt to joke about it. If it is your way of coping then by all means you can cope with it however you want, just be sure to also consider how others might interpret it too, alright? If you wish to discuss today’s events there’s #current-events-talk Which you opt in by getting the role in the roles channel I see you have the role already Remembered that my orientation is paid Double. :e_minor: :e_minor: :this_is_fine: You wish That orientation felt like a fever dream Good question I’ll find out later lol @azula This is a threat dunno i desire company as i do my notes but i do not know of anyone who is willing to an hour is fine viv you have to sit your ass down with him and talk about it Anyways my new boss looks like this dude I’m not at the beach this is a bathtub Viv you have to explain to him why you’re angy Communication COMMUNICATE THAT YOU ARE ANGRY BECAUSE _ hold on didn’t your therapist literally tell you this exact shit But about that one whore VIV- Viv don’t break up with him while your emotional radar is high Men are men you have to tell him You realize he can’t read your mind Ok so What’s got you pissy at him Explain it to me I- What’s the context tell me that again no viv i am asking you to explain it again. nah to me this time i will help your ass develop a viv-attitude-free message to him and now you're pissy at him ok you're angry because you feel like he's making an unfair comparison "himbo box i am angry/frustrated at you because i feel as if you made an unfair comparison on how we spend our money. i suggested you to purchase android because of your tendency to break apple products, which are more expensive. When you tried to talk back and mentioned that i have 3 nintendo switches, that was not a fair comparison because only one of 1 i actually purchased for myself after saving up money for over a year." something like that "i do not appreciate your backlash when i made a suggestion that would be financially beneficial." also apple laptop rlly homie rlly brand shopping tho he is literally the person marketers WANT NO that's only going to fuel the fire bruv what "everyone else does" that's what they call.... a sheep. he wants to fit in. was he bullied as a child or something? because liking something to specifically feel the need to fit in i think you can try assuring that he will be perfect with or without apple. it will not matter who tf gonna bully him for getting a different brand tf he's a grown ass man hi mom you can't get everyone to like you, unfortunately. being bullied as a child and likely excluded from a lot of social aspects it makes sense why he would become a serial people pleaser what it is not is getting him to realize how self destructive it has become is it *him* specifically being clumsy or is he just constantly being vibe checked drew... you never know... how else have his electronics been vibe checked express how you're also frustrated with his lack of attentiveness for things he owns he doesn't seem to be taking care of the things he owns and that's going to be an ouchie in the money lands wtf how big was the painting that he didn't see it true true take some space first then talk you can't really think if you're being emotionally driven no shit drew thanks for the contribution lmao sorry it'd been too long since i've insulted you :e_minor: i mean at this point your mood is pretty much ruined do you think you can calm down and talk it out anytime soon? because otherwise i think it'd probably be a good idea to ask him to go home ye i mean you're clearly also angry with him because you feel like he's dismissing your feelings. it's the couples counseling with actual lack of real world experience :e_minor: actually i do have dating experience ... but uh we all know by now how that has turned out 🤡 how do those two CONNECT ok now it makes sense i gets it what did he dump you? ok he didn't uno reverse you ok where do you need to talk about it grief is still grief, viv clearly. ok but i would've turn up with baseball bat too man all this content on the sims on rae's account im gonna have a field day goodbye everyone see you next week when i have my sims burnout :e_minor: Bruh I spent over an hour huh Not even past the sim creating part ALFJSKFJSL Pretty much My head hurts now Mhmm in a bit Still uwuing over my dog.

I have to look at designs and fonts and be able to tell what era/movement they are from :e_minor: Yes I have to be able to tell When this font was made It’s the fact that I think I might know for me Based on how decorative it is Reverse image search who @DaHomieDrew @Belbercike are any of you gays interested in sitting in vc with me art nouveau it... curvy vrae classic typography of the art nouveau style yes it is a font. decorative fonts aren't my thing unfortunately well at least cubism will be easy for me if i am terrified of it it's cubism idk something about the style just send shivers down my spine forg :ConfusedCat: quiz political science hmmm MMMMM haha @zimzalabim :e_minor: join vc so we can guide you to download bluestacks Man My head hurts like a bitch :e_minor: Just b like that Hurt so bad I’m starting to salivate I want ikea food the fact that she had to clarify to not do anything dangerous or illegal if only i could my broken social norm is following the actual directions nah i won't listen thanks <3 hmmm i guess i can just not give a fuck™️ towards everything including the paper cuz the norm would be that you follow directions you listen etc break the social norm of following directions OOP see the thing is i don't even know anyone really online skool yo no i mean i could buy a gorilla suit and just literally go out and about in it lol or i can get one of my friends and we can dress up as a gorilla and a banana and then go out and about LMAO gorilla suits are expensive tho i forgot more than a video game these days or go to a store and talk really loudly about something you usually would not talk about in the open like any sort of gossip i think the directions thing would be the easiest to do and get reactions out of what test didn't exist like the test itself didn't exist? nice my idea so far is to not follow directions aka literally ignore the assignment's instructions as an example of deviance i'll turn something in but it'll be like "my example is not doing this" this is 25% of my grade and i'm rlly gonna pull this huh anyways remember how part of the directions was to ask her if we're unsure im not even gonna ask as part of my active ignoring no :))) if i fail i literally will brawl with this lady ok but i've talked to her a couple of times which is probably more than a lot of people in my class since this is online oop me: apparently people don't like it when you don't follow instructions or directions so im just gonna not thanks for reading my midterm paper what do you want me to do add heart emojis? LOL i will draw a dinosaur anhiro's suggestion made me laugh tho submit someone else's as going against the rule of academic honesty I mean it’s a better idea than actually doing something plus it’s funny plus it actually works It’s whether or not my professor is willing to accept such deviance Too bad the actual prompt literally has the word deviance in it :e_minor: Social Norms and Deviance Social norm is to follow directions Deviance is to proceed to not ™ Give me reasons That don’t involve you Is that it just remembered about the time my therapist had me do this sheet or whatever and one of the questions asked what i feared so i put republicans @azula morning :Bbay: VIV VIV WAIT JUST REMEMBERED viv are we still gonna bet on whether rae or fae is whiter via a dna test money on fae. see there is evidence that rae might be a spicy white so fae it's 2 for Rae and 1 for Fae rn just because fae seasons their food does not mean- SLKFGHDFJLK:G THAT'S YOUR REASONING ??? i mean fae does sound like a filipino american i can see how you would think korean too ^ yeah fae has an asian american voice yeah redhead both of you could probably trace your genes to one region in Ireland or smtn fae's ref photo for hair color looks like your shade anime joke about what no there is literally no joke to it OK RAE YOUR HAIR LITERALLY FLUCTUATES wack SKGJ inb4 they're related see for being a white person fae sounds nothing like a white person rae opens her mouth and you instantly know ah this chick is white funny enough im literally writing an analysis on about my social status as an asian person oop viv look we helped a family reunion no you have like that accent "too late" oop ok lu i knew you were hispanic the moment i heard your voice tho ah yes your senior photo i can't believe that shade of red ever existed on you at best lke like maybe a ginger looks closer to a dirty blonde tho but it's likely the lighting too almost orangeish yeah remember that snap on my story where my face was completely illuminated now that's lighting yes just clowned myself on snapchat thanks rae i don't wanna talk about it hgjflk;dfhgdfljkh; i feel like i stepped on a landmine 🤡 i use snap to snap rae stupid shit and maybe occasionally post on my private story about some stupid shit when i deleted my old snap and made a new one without an embarrassing username my exgf rlly tried to add me on it no <3 a lot of my friends have jobs too lol im not interested in flexing good luck trying :ConfusedCat: what quizzes if you're talking about my polisci ones i did em  yesterday perfect scores across the board again oop currently i am finishing up my weekly sociology analysis then i think i'll wrap it up for today i wish to spend some free time on the sims tims... anyways you're welcome, mother tomorrow i crack down on my design history midterm that's due on friday and my sociology stuff new week bby.... busy week. my training is on wednesday at 4:30pm and my first day of work is on saturday 8am wack is this what they call being an adult oh god chill out mom my cousin is here now tomorrow... hmm yeah sure i think i am free ... ? idk voltra we are a similar shade of asian SLDJGHSFL; i i think we are a similar shade of asian lol yeah was reminded about when 23andme suggested i had trace ancestry to northern india or around that area oop oop oh ye LU HAVE YOU SEEN THE TIKTOKS I HAVE BEEN SENDING YOU @Arzaylea the one i sent today yes it is a personal attack.

do you have any other passions? hmm rather than drop out is there a way you can pause your education and take some sort of time off or gap year? i mean can you afford it surely it can't be worse than american prices and as for passions the reality is that oop anyways the thing is it's more of finding something you're okay with working in rather than liking sometimes work is just work oh my god uber bot not the time LMAO if you don't like IT then maybe switch to a similar field that you at least don't hate it is hard indeed dang can't even transfer gen eds or anything? then again i don't know how college works there might i ask though do you have a plan after you drop out? what would you do? sounds like you're still unsure how have you been handling classes then yeah and what classes do you have left you really could try some methods to help reduce stress levels and help make it through and cope back to a previous question have you seen anyone for these things? a medical professional i mean i think that would be my suggestion- see one that you feel comfortable with and see what they think ah yes stereotypes are you old enough to seek treatment on your own? :ConfusedCat: wack remember to try to censor out words that might be triggering tho it's fine sometimes parents either learn on their own or the hard way im glad my parents are educated now but how they got there was probably one of the worst ways possible still really do recommend trying to seek treatment on your own and if you can't afford it then try looking for some programs other than that i do not think i am qualified to suggest anything else since i myself am a fresh college student mayhaps some of the older members can chime in a little later it's a coping method try to find some more too to help especially when it gets hard to deal with at home music, tv, whatever you enjoy even a snack idk have you ever looked into the automotive industry or trade schools related to it where do you live anyways if you're okay with answering that Do not worry I will do something about this Update: I have done something about it @Arzaylea check dms It has dipped a little but I’ve pretty much doubled in balance from yesterday alone Dogecoin rose like six cents Dogecoin Too poor for Bitcoin :pika_amaze: :pikaohoho: Ok I sleep now Any of y’all got an Elliot photo Damn just the neutral sprite huh I wanted to do his smiling one Thank Fantastic fae Anyone wanna put it on a pretty background Ok then Transparwent it is It shows up white Oop Oh well If y’all want We vc nearly daily now Hw grind don’t stop Speaking of which @Belbercike ayo we doing hw or what will sit in vc then @Arzaylea gj on shift yeah monday at 4:30 pst that's it for next week it seems lol @faede damn homie is dinner that bussin @Belbercike u ok bro u been gone a while mornin omg fae ur alive still i am gonna finish world 6 on this bee game then catch up on bee swarm simulator since i know the game has changed quite a bit since i last played so i wanna learn about the new stuff or else yall gonna be asking questions i do not have answers to lmao rare big braen moments oop nice nice AC stresses me on another level somehow i am overwhelmed but it is what it is animal crossing specifically new horizons air conditioner update may or may not have renewed an addiction. ugh not againnnnnn look it's wholesome game... it rlly is tho too bad there's a lil gacha element so plus it's visually gratifying me screaming at the fact that i still have yet to get a new mythic bee type My niblings suddenly are here Niblings.

Welp Godspeed to me Miraculously I made it home Anyways My shift was good It went nicely it was a slow day and quite a bit of my BOH coworkers helped out Too bad I think I have beef with one of the hosts now :soobinclown: Ok so this coworker in general she doesn’t rlly give a damn ™ She complains a lot which is normal but it also shows with how she leaves things for me to wash Most of my host/server coworkers make their way to actually organize the baskets and plates for me and place them where I can reach them Homegirl just leaves it and goes She was carrying in a tub of the plates and baskets for me to which I joked about her giving me more work I don’t think it came across as a joke but doesn’t matter since she ends up dropping the entire tub on accident and gets stuff all over herself I would’ve helped her but I was already washing the other dishes so I couldn’t and only ended up staring while the other front house staff helped her and whatnot When she left I helped pick up the things since my hands finally had been freed Anyways so there’s a lil container filled with water to put the ramekins that had condiments in so the sauces wouldn’t dry out and get crusty Sometimes the ramekins end up floating and since I don’t exactly have the foot life expectancy to move around a lot I just end up aiming the little nozzle at it so it’ll sink Whatever a bit of the nozzle water splashed on her on accident so which I immediately apologized but internally I’m like thank god that wasn’t the condiment water Haha she ended up giving me attitude and was like “that was unnecessary” at me spraying the ramekins down Later on I finally find out what her name is and omg it’s the same girl that the two coworkers that I managed to somewhat befriend have been complaining about since she doesn’t do anything and once said she was unwell and left and stranded one of them to do an entire shift alone Hosting an entire restaurant alone ain’t very cash money :soobinclown: :soobinclown: :soobinclown: So Oop Front staff is supposed to put mugs and such in a crate on a shelf just above and once it’s full I can just grab the crate and put it through as well as dump out extra things and food Towards closing she ended up just leaving everything there and left And I was like :catHello: Ma’am you forgot to- See usually I would just do it myself but it was closing I literally was balancing an entire kitchen worth of containers and stuff to both clean and shelf So that was fun At least the other girl I talked to today was nice since my two coworker friends didn’t work today We’re the same age c: Also was cleaning a bottle of truffle sauce and didn’t know there was a hole on the other end that would dispense when there was pressure on the inside and I accidentally got some truffle water on her Eh more or less I think half the time she’s there Continuing this later on I was like “ok I’ll cover up the hole on this bottle that obviously has an opening so it doesn’t spray” and shook it away from her Anyways clown shit I forgot about the pressure thing and when I released my finger I ended up spraying palm chili sauce water on both of us :soobinclown: :soobinclown: :soobinclown: :soobinclown: :soobinclown: At least she was cool with it She even said bye to me when she left how inclusive I think she’s a new hire tho since I only recently saw her working here I’m bad at socializing and I’m extremely blunt and look like I hate everyone and everything so I can guarantee my first impressions on other people probably aren’t spectacular Thankfully no The ranch bottle I knew won’t backsplash Wouldn’t* I probably made it worse by being too shy to ask other coworker to move so I could get the crates off of the shelf to wash since both were full And waited until she left to do them Ma’am I’m not avoiding you well maybe I am because of the eternal guilt I feel I’m just incapable of speaking up it's only fun if they're scheduled the same shift neither of them were today :e_minor: fellas is it gay to know how to cook men wont even let water touch their asses i wish they did i've told rae this before but bidets wouldnt survive here because straight men and toxic masculinity god forbid some water spray your butt to get it clean thanks for reminding me to convince my parents to let me purchase bidets for our house tho] she seems like she'd have a single post from 2015 or something would she even have a profile picture Wait a damn minute BREAD????

exactly... imagine meeting someone amazing and then only thing that's off putting is that they share a name with one of your parents or siblings difficult. but the association asian people and choosing the whitest names possible with their kid esp immigrant parents im not pretty enough to be on dating apps man the place i work at one of my good friends happens to like the food there so i'm taking her there on sunday lmao 50% employee discount :e_minor: idk if i'd be able to hold it together since one of my coworker friends works a shift that day uhh it's like burgers, fries, soups, mexican food in a colonized/whitewashed hawaii themed restaurant :) welp there's the menu then LMAO you asked what we have i will see that through and yeye im picking her up at like 12:30 here's the thing tho i don't even know her address i just know where her house is still i told her she didn't have to bring money since i'll be paying since i'm the one who technically invited her there are no numbers :^) plus that ain't my job anyways peace out i work in the back okay but when it says the chips and salsa are freshly made daily they actually ain't lying when i walk in for opening i literally see them cutting tortillas to make them into chips when it comes to the burgers they are very attentive per say the preps literally be measuring the patties by the gram to ensure they're the same or by ounce i haven't seen what the scale is still there are off menu items that aren't here :catHideThePain: but my specific location has truffle fries and such now too whatever the moa crisp is or whatnot yeah that's the general menu but i'm pretty sure it varies by location Fuck I forgot my internet now automatically shuts off at 11:30 and turns back on at 6 Anyways uh Rip to my quiz Indeed I have no sense of time Time is very meaningful. How else am I supposed to be with my dog as much as I can We always wish for more time Yet take it for granted When you’re ready again I think you should consider adopting another friend They won’t replace rusty but Perhaps they can carry on his legacy Yes indeed How do your parents feel Hmm So you’re assuming they’re not open to a new dog Hey man Parents and the “I don’t want a dog” They’re definitely grieving.

do you have holiday break coming up how long do you have left hmm seems viable then homie take a fucking chill pill im willing to take a bet that you don't really have any coping methods your stress tolerance is probably at an all time low too improve your well being, my guy. journal, write out your thoughts, etc learn time management because if you're bad at it then it's going to suck i'm only okay right now because i suddenly developed a sense of time management which has allowed me to both balance work and free time otherwise i'd probably be crying on the floor every week when i say coping methods i mean how you deal with stress and stressful situations. it's the work vs play when you have work do you spread it out accordingly or do you have a tendency to procrastinate college is a stress trigger for you yeah but there's a difference between spacing it out and trying to do it all at once even if it's at the beginning doing it all at once is still going to stress you i thought that was normal for stress o i know people but that's besides the point even if you look out in the future i do agree that if you finish it out you're still prob gonna end up in a job you wish you didn't have if you're truly gonna drop out then i advise you to search for things that you could pursue instead but not something you have to like sometimes work is just... work, yknow as long as you don't hate it. maybe idk how good they are where you live here it's like a hit or miss lol I’ve never had a Klondike bar lol Toothpaste Eh that don’t sound too bad Anyways I shall pass out again cyall bitches later ayo chill i was already considering that fae and i had the same idea fae just said it first lol mine was just simmering in my brain for a while sigh yeah yeah i concede exactly why else would fae think of that ah fuck i have work today hhhhh im tireddddd idk why my energy just dead :this_is_fine: hh this is a different tired tho ok i ate a drumstick as in the ice cream. :) does appie juice count anyone wanna vc i have adopted an entire population of dogs Oop I have work hahahahha Me having to explain to them that I probably have to had a period of leave at one point Anyways cyall laterrrr Haha finally home No <3 Suddenly everyone decided to eat out today for some reason It was busy.

didn't have last names either when they finally were allowed to a lot of them chose based on the already established noble family names hence when there's so many Kim's, Choi's, etc for viets the reason why a lot of ppl are named Nguyen is because the emperor forced everyone to change their last names to Nguyen otherwise they'd be persecuted. should have it somewhere i forgot where it was lol

the previous group i talked to this about they all wore socks in showers the fluffy socks were popular apparently personally i'm not a fan of those tho see how is it gross it protects your feet and you don't sleep jesus christ yall really be stepping on a surface where other people's bare feet have touched? in my house it's just me and my brother who use the same shower my parents use the one in the master bathroom still shower mats still are being stepped on changes nothing yall dont? who is we how do you guys not know about this there's literally socks made for showering i just use the rubber grip ones tho like the psych ward socks you don't wash your feet in the shower you like do the fish pedicure yknow where the fishies eat the dead skin off your feet and then afterwards you can put in all the footcare stuff duh it's like the pooka fish in that one victorious episode except it won't yeet you look my feet are perfectly healthy aside from the surgery stuff but aside from that can't believe you guy s have never heard of showering with socks on nah yall the ones with dirty feet how else are you supposed to really clean them? soap and water can only do so much water still goes through the socks technically that can work too i've tried that but it gets slippery almost died yeah so why wouldn't you? see i mean in college dorms with the public showers i sure hope you wear at least shower slippers imagine the funky on those floors exactly slippers, socks general foot shower protection im asian too nakey feet wack showering with bare feet is the weird thing it's about reducing the chances technically it still can but wearing socks in showers helps plus it's a nice feeling :) even after you get out it's like a lil heat pack for your feet especially helpful in the winter but that's weird they're not made for your feet no because they're made for your feet so they're good then pants are clothing but would you wear them on your torso? not exactly since they're not made for your torso that's why there's shirts and whatnot hence the difference between showercaps and socks overalls exist too but that's beside the point here jumpsuits too but the head and feet are on the opposite sides of your body also, notice how overalls and whatnot are not exactly a shirt or pant they are in their own category and the point is this is socks for showering yes jesus christ what the hell why does no one know about showering with socks why are you calling it weird don't knock it till you try it who is nobody i was talking about showering with socks like asking what socks people wore when they showered technically there's socks made specifically for the shower but i just wear good ol rubber grip socks plus they can be washed and reused eh the slippers get heavy tho kinda hard to move/keep them on socks stay on your feet water makes things heavy viv's family already damaged the world with bambi no need to rub it in by walking out of the shower with bare feet her family made bambi like the dude who created bambi is related to viv viv's uncle also played li shang in mulan so you can sit on that info or least i think it was her uncle i forgot how exactly they're related no bambi and li shang are different men same family tho anyways back to the original point can't believe you're trying to argue on this socks and showering go together like peanut butter and jelly so thanks but i like my rubber grip socks the ones from the psych ward hit different tho see someone gets it yall rlly be the minority exposed feet... see it was even a qotd question in a server i'm in i wouldn't wear thigh highs tho but to each their own oh i wear them in and out like i said the fish help clean them oop the fish do tickle a bit tho but they just doing their thing you get used to it swim swim do what i thought we were talking about what kind of socks you wear while showering oh no it's ok i wash them with my laundry every week lu u don't have to do anything when im lazy sometimes and it's a cold night kinda just wear them to sleep oops :soobinclown: morning what socks do you wear while showering, rayven that vaccine go to the hospital something is wrong your cognitive function socks while showering is perfectly normal hmm you know i should try wearing thicker socks since the rubber grip ones are on the thinner side wonder how that would feel hey i only wear socks when i get too lazy to take them off after i shower otherwise i don't sleep with socks on you don't?

Please erase all my memories
 
Far away through the dense fog
The far path I departed on only left hurtful marks
Even as I try to grasp the ends of the dream
Eventually, longer and longer
I fall asleep in a deep silence
 
Oh now, holding this pain
Like the day I abandoned everything
It grows more painful every day
Endlessly in front of my eyes, deja vu
 
Oh deja vu
Oh deja vu
Oh deja vu
So I fallen now
 
As long as I can breathe
I can’t let go of you again
We’ll be together for every moment
Don’t move far away from me
 
Eh I want these moments to all be false
Uh I hope these are passing delusions
If through wet tears, through belated regrets
I can go return, return yeah
 
So now, I’m holding this pain
Like how you abandoned everything
It grows clearer every day
Endlessly in front of my eyes, deja vu
 
Oh deja vu
Oh deja vu
Oh deja vu
So I fallen now
 
As long as I can breathe
I can’t let go of you again
We’ll be together for every moment
Beside me
 
All the truths I believed
Covered me in falsehoods
Oh ah In the midst of the darkness, like a ray of light
You took my hand, I follow you
Follow you
 
Oh deja vu
Oh deja vu
Oh deja vu
I’m saved now
 
Even if I bet all of me for you
And the painful wounds deepen
As though every moment is a dream
I won’t move away from you

above you pronounce the vowel like a question ~ is like the spanish tilde lol ish? idk just inflict like the symbol looks like you only put the tone indicators over vowels so drew this means you accept at least one of them if you counted the lack of tone indicator as its own it'd be 6 please do inform on how i wanna know :o but yeah in simple terms viet tone indicators literally tell you how to change the tone within itself based on their shape oop just be that way sometimes better than nothing children learn languages better the younger they are as you get older it's harder to retain since you have to work harder to keep it up like i spend one day without looking at japanese it's over english is a germanic language so it really depends what language is being taught based on what like learning japanese from english is a lot harder than japanese from korean tho my limited korean is somehow helping with japanese since some of the patterns are similar tho some of the katakana looks exactly like hangeul so it's going to trip me out duolingo is supposed to be a supplement too lol it ain't technically supposed to actually be the thing teaching you babies and speech are similar adults who speak to babies like they would speak to other adults find that the babies speak much "better" per se babies don't know oral language so they have other ways a lot of communication is nonverbal anyways we still do most of our communication is nonverbal body languages and cues, etc yes i mean yeah @red hot silly pepper post traumatic down syndrome viv was on the news because of it the news. lu send it it's on youtube your's is only available upon some sort of crisis oop why feel better soon feel better now. :pepelol: idk i can vc now lol but i only have like an hour before i wanna go to bed me too bitch you ain't special i have a whole ass speech tomorrow hahahahhaaha https://tenor.com/view/twice-feel-special-dancing-kpop-gif-15507184 i'm bringing more than enough of viv already Oop It’s called code switching Yes There’s even a term for when you go go a bookstore and feel like shitting Mariko Aoki phenomenon Iirc it has to do something with the pages/ink themselves Apparently the ink has a laxative effect And probably the association has to do with it too Pavlov’d yourself into shitting when reading Throwback to when I learned about how kegels worked while playing Minecraft Gorilla grip :catHello: Milf mug speech 5 minute crafts is a menace to society Oh right aku I don’t like sweets too much so I already feel sick Time to store for tomorrow after yeeting the mochi since it’ll go bad in the fridge Lololol how does a place with the word BREAD in its name run out of it boi i think that's just you do you have a bread curse or something bread... mornin the fact that my other server has a counting channel where all we do is count and we've been at it for over 2 years now yes yes any of yall wanna play minecraft so is that a yes or no my prof's daughter plays mc and apparently she got very excited to hear that "big kids" played minecraft too so now i'm taking photos of my basement to show my building :soobinclown: yes ouch nice my mom also dyed her hair and i told her her hair looks like a boykin spaniel's ears and i think she regrets birthing me again it's more of the texture tho imo still boykin spaniel. my aunt paid me to pluck her grey hairs out. she does not need to know i just want my money gaslight gatekeep girlboss Have a good class doge Huh @azula how’d your cousin manage to summon both of us Yes https://tenor.com/view/test-spray-testing-gif-12514630 No Morning Alright if y’all see me in about 8 hours online please convince me to stay up I have hw to finish.

This is because as an LMS, Canvas alone cannot monitor your computer’s activities. However, if Canvas has proctoring software integrated into it, it can monitor such and even prevent you from sending such screenshots." hahaha so unless you're on some sort of proctoring software canvas cannot detect screenshots lit canvas cannot tell if you're screensharing it can only detect if the window isn't on top yeah canvas can tell if you switched tabs just not *what* you switched to so with this knowledge ayo lu what are you up to today :^) are you sure bro six flags ain't cheap oop do you have a charger? i mean six flags does have the little stamp thing that indicates you're gonna go back to the park right tho idk how they gonna do it now since covid your excuse is your child needs you "you have a ki-"

Also half of my face is numb Two days later. Apparently you’re only supposed to be in mild discomfort??? Meanwhile I’m crying multiple times a day from the pure pain Medical terminology @Arzaylea there are studies showing that you retain read things better if they're physical so you're more likely to retain a physical book than an e-book me and my medical terminology class association yes it works a little too well everytime i eat a certain thing i remember something i read in 8th grade. indeed do you also remember literally where in a book soething is something* or is it just me so like for example something will ask about a term or reference a part of a textbook and i can recall literally *where* in the book it is as in what side of the page and whatnot why did you have to say it in here out of all channels EXACTLY "oh my god it's that caption under that photo of a _" too bad i didn't exactly read it There are multiple iterations of it @DaHomieDrew @Belbercike there’s a dude in here that I just KNOW y’all would call a dilf In my escape room There probably is a hidden dilf in this server We just don’t know. Fun Halloween activity Read the reviews on the roblox app @Arzaylea wanna watch me play heavily modded minecraft called RLcraft where last night my soul literally left my body for a moment from sheer fear it'll be later but still it's also insanely hard! how about in 1.5 hours...? since that's when i get out of class alrighty ! anyone else can join too tho if you're gonna be there i just know fae will sense it somehow for context the thing that scared the living fuck out of me looks like this i did not know they existed. spicy it's a silent creature too. LITERALLY ON THE STARTING GUIDE "If it looks like it will kill you, it probably will" detective fae ain't a detective for nothin :sherlockkanna: @Arzaylea i will be in vc @DaHomieDrew sister summon literally had someone at my escape room dress as james charles flashback mary https://tenor.com/view/hi-sisters-gif-19968610 no you dont kids can be annoying but please do not endorse violence towards them kids can be annoying but please remember to treat them as people and not look down on them break the cycle, folks. like mother like son you too huh :shrugz: any of yall wanna play minecraft later but with datapacks so the game basically turns into chaos this is one option every day in minecraft you turn into a different mob for better or worse it gets ridiculous which is why it's funny as hell godspeed to your sleep there's quite a few datapacks out there like random loot drops too and etc oh perfect Oop Go advocate for yourself girlie @Arzaylea I fucked up so bad I set myself up for disaster by unintentionally completing all my humanities Me but mentally So all I have left are stem. So this is my map. Chem 231 is organic chemistry I do. I didn’t think I would be done I honest to god thought I had Humanities left Turns out I rlly speeded them Either way I Exceed. This is my schedule for next semester Assuming I don’t drop Japanese Which honestly Might have to I literally don’t have any other time slots for it IT WAS MY ONLY OPTION yeah <3 They’re all in person. Actually History Is on another campus. Thags like 20 minutes away But the prof is super good so Plus there’s asynchronous math class. I have priority registration so Registration ain’t open to everyone yet so Thus I can make all the changes I want for now Ok but like on god this was literally the best I could do Actually No They’re the prereqs :Bruh: No no They’re the prereqs For the prereqs 😭😭😭😭 When I transfer I’ll have an associates as well. Ikr Basically i need an associates in biology to transfer. But then there’s also specific classes that are outside of the bio degree I ended to transfer too Diagnostic medical sonography I’m majoring in stress And to top it all o Off I also have a job. So realistically will likely end up spending a lil while longer in community college Oh well nothing wrong with that Bruh all the stuff above is just what I need specifically for bio degree There’s also the Gen Ed’s Which have specific classes Like personal growth, poli sci, and sociology All which I’ve done but Literally I’m just dying for the next few years But if I make it I’ll emerge with a good career. And Lu as my coworker.

ONLY I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT datapacks are server side so only the console requires it you don't need to get it yourself since it's not a client side thing of course if you wanna do it singleplayer obviously you needa dl it but still this is multiplayer so tl;dr: you don't have to do anything so what about it huh @DaHomieDrew :Bruh: what are you hesitating about all you'd have to do differently is nothing; just log onto the server as per usual and the change will already be there mkmk GOOOO i do not like that explanation of how eyelids work @faede @DaHomieDrew @Belbercike are any of yall interested in playing broken minecraft and by broken i just mean extremely chaotic datapacks. like i explained it drew you don't have to do anything since it's vanilla only i have to download and upload it to the server files thank u fae u r my savior i just needa finish this japanese quiz first ok am done @faede will sit in vc Ayo send link ???

Do ya think you’d be an offensive or support role I can see fae being support since it fits their vibe imo You’d be a wildcard since it’s either you decide to destroy everyone in sight or bring your nursing instincts into the game Lu, that is Idk about Drew and bel tho lol Viv would be the person who keeps dying in game because she rushes in and basically has to have a designated healer This game is more simple tho so thank god for that lol The stats are attack, critical, speed, defense, and HP which are straightforward Sadly there’s no magic Dungeon Quest would be magic but that game be weird in balancing imo RPG Simulator is where it’s at And there’s only 2 categories of skills which are Attack and Support which are also straightforward You start with only being able to equip one skill but as you level up you unlock up to 2 more slots So 3 skills total And the pets give minor boosts and they range from animals to anime characters. Oop Mayhaps so @faede may i interest you in cat  pet it's a godly level so you have a 1% chance Cat boosts your defense and crit rate actually works for a support role lol two of my other godly tiers are... Dio and... Anime Rap God. there are also runes which are basically power boosts some are active some are passive the one i currently have is rune of vitality which heals 1% of my health every time i get a hit Bro he even has the ゴゴゴゴ aura emitting from him in game lol Sunscreen of course that was fast.

Somehow. Mario Kart was a literal chaos ride I remember one of my cousins got pissy that I beat him at a game and he chucked the wii remote at me Did it hurt? No but I cried extra hard so he’d get in more trouble And he did We can always pretend Pinned a message. Yes Bro I was forced to go to work only for this group to not show up They’re 15 minutes late already If it reaches 20 we have to cancel since there’s no way they’d finish on time Yes at least I’m getting paid god bless There’s an 8:15 group I was so bad at tennis it seemed like I was good Wii sports was the shit Well well well guess I’m just here until 8:15 I fucked up so bad apparently I originally said I couldn’t go to this current game so then my boss cancelled it but then managed to convince myself I could and actually go after rushing everything And forgot the most important part which was telling them I could now go.

That’d be the start Tho I don’t think it takes a genius to understand that showing explicit things to minors is a bad thing The only people who think it’d be okay are minors themselves or predators They are under the predator category I understand where you’re coming from though that you’d be doing it on the basis of informed consent But it still doesn’t negate the fact that you’d essentially still be potentially allowing minors to see those things and that’s where it gets mushy on the legal and moral spectrum It’s like putting a sign that says “do not enter” in front of a door instead of locking it Glasses because my face feels naked without them Guys I have an announcement to make I bought Dino nuggies. That is all. Achoo Of course Me in chem Understandable L Ok it makes sense now Lmao Flipping neighbors mowing the lawn Can’t sleep Dw I have Filipino neighbors too lol @faede y’all heard em I’m at the cafe below the escape room I used to work at I think one of my old classmates is here But I can’t tell cuz masks!!

Tis what they call… slugging Sounds weird as hell but it helps You do your skincare stuff and then at the end add a petroleum jelly based product like vaseline or aquaphor It supposedly helps trap in the moisture from the skincare product so it doesn’t evaporate or whatever Either way it makes your skin soft as fuck I broke the tie I’m simply an admirer of women LDKSMFLDD I can do it right now Jk I’d need like 10 minutes to get to my pc Well monopoly takes like an hour so AINFSKGKSK Five I can get to my pc in 5 minutes. @faede are you gonna join us Wait… this means they’d have the chance to win again tho ok it has been 5 mintes minutes* ur in luck cuz it's ROnopoly @Arzaylea vc fae has a winning streak they have not lost a game. yet. @azula Ahem I was checking on a group of kids and they were talking about what they would eat if they were in death row as their last meal :pepelol: One of the children asked me if I was married :soobinclown: I mean some random man thought I was my niece’s dad And thus my sister in law’s husband 😭 I was Highly disgusted internally Barf L on all sides :toe: I- Y’all Sushi has a dog friend now 😭🥺 Lame af it’s limiting y’all?
