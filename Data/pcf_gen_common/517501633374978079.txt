Hello there Actually no, Zig’s my fave but Quinn is my heart female LI wise I just chose one of my loves for pp Hi Pri 💜💜💜💜 noice to see ya again oof what the ef Casual i say i want to, then i end up making the same MC defined diamond face, deepset downturned eyes with ranging eye colors, deep brown hair that's usually in one of the princess braid hairstyles, round button nose, arched thin/arched thin high eyebrows, and small heart lips with red garnet lipstick Hm that’s a cool way to quote people I’m sending hugs and chocolate Canning Apples with the Cordonians? was brookley the one that left ah I’m only going to the college I am because of a heavy scholarship I was granted and it’s still enough that my parents have put off replacing things like our fridge until they really can’t anymore because we’re too middle class for federal aid Is the eye emoji your words of wisdom ended Ender Legit the day before I turned 18 I was messaging my friends about if I should do any unlawful shit because records seal I didn’t end up doing any of it His wisdom -> dont be 29 Don’t worry I only bend the rules Not the laws Lu read my DMs please 🥺 Metta go finish the Firered randomizer Had to send it Y’all kept telling me Telling the chat * So I had to share the cursed meme BATS My mom practically interrogated me when she somehow “figured out” I was bi (I’m pretty sure she snooped at something) and I was a junior at the time. Thought I was too young to know and thinks there’s only two ways to know you’re into females, kissing and getting ||intimate||, and by that point I’d kissed a girl but I wasn’t telling her that. It’s been a few years and I am still confident in my sexuality but I don’t want to tell her and deal with that interrogation again. Asian parents be like that and it’s frustrating I’m lucky that my brother and cousins got my back But not quite ready for the whole coming out thing to my fam 💜💜 I don’t really talk about my experience much But I can relate to family Being wack sometimes I wonder if boomers play Choices I wish I had access to the this emoji from Spoilerland Which is why the GOC LI’s exist And fail to deliver on proper rep Ugh yeah Only MTFL, DS, and Blades are new stories with non-gender customizable LIs This year Having set love interests In race and gender It was cool I liked choosing from who existed rather than customizing Like with episode you can always customize your LI And I always end up making them look the same Regardless of story I don’t want to customize Tbh the user stories where you can’t are written better than When you can Paix Paix is french for peace Had to mix it up I usually use an N-95 if I’m going into a place where people have been frequently I would say Amanda but I know an Indian girl named Amanda (She pronounced it Ah-Mun-Dah) Are bapre Did you know You can skydive without a parachute But only once Nooooo Fun fact I once did parasailing It was lit Or maybe it was paragliding Now drake just is a terrible person apparently Josh made the right decision not inviting him to his wedding Campana is Spanish for bell I heard? Water Gotcha It was probably dangerous And if I’d been presented with the opportunity again my parents wouldn’t let me But it was Fantastic Yeah My parents worried about the like straps snapping Omg like Kassidy? My middle name is my dad’s name Joshua peck knew what he was up to with the whole Not inviting him to his wedding thing Their “reunions” on YouTube felt forced They definitely only did it for fans to not hate them Wait there were reunions with Miranda? After the whole wedding things Thing? I still have no idea how Jeanette and arianna filmed sam and cat while disliking each other I’ve noticed spin-offs don’t last Unless you’re raven’s home I feel like raven is unnecessarily extra In her parenting style in season 4 And she doesn’t have visions on screen anymore It is pretty wholesome still They did an entire covid Christmas episode Only show incorporating the real situation thus far I still think Tori and Andre shoulda been a thing The only people Tori wasn’t shippable with imo Was cat and Robbie Beck, jade, and Andre all fit well with her Them two are the TV version of MC and Aurora in OH ThEy’Re JUst FrIEnDs They were honestly creepy and seeing his attraction to Jade was ridiculously uncomfortable Couture Why are all their December released late December And FA Barely is December Merry Christmas!

I allowed the gf to stay at my home so that they can still go to college, but recently my son has started to favor his bio dad and has started referring to me by my first name.
