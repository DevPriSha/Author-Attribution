tho i think it'd make a bit more sense for her old character traits to poke through at times while still displaying some new ones that resulted from her respective traumas but it kinda just felt like they tossed her old personality out the window completely granted it's been a while since i've watched so i'd have to go back and watch through completely to get a better sense of it but that's just from what i remember yep yep i'll probably go through volumes 3-6 p soon just so i can get a better handle on what's happening/going to happen LOL :PES_Think: oh boy oh yeah what happened to the yang puns!!! :FeelsBadMan: i just like ships casually in rwby tbh but none of them really have a special place in my heart OOP oh boy actually wait i think i've seen it LOL it's....

bi but weekes was afraid of making solas fall into the depraved bi trope yeye im lov weekes yeah same also it was kind of weird because anders was treated as like gay if m!hawke romanced him but straight with f!hawke was really wacky imo yep that was pretty uhhhh wacky i didnt like that nice nice fr fr idk i like in dai how each character has a set sexuality and same with dao even if that ratio is a bit too equal for my liking but that's one thing i liked abt both dao and dai yep da2 combat is gooood i like how as a mage you can actually use the blade on ur staff yep... even though the blade still existed/? / gkjgkkjagkj ?? yep imo knight enchanter is the only fun mage specialization in dai some of the spells with the others are cool but knight enchanter is broke so you can spam ur blade i have a mod that just unlocks every specialization so i can be ultimate mage™️ i love it makes you super broken YES i miss when you could like be a mage and use a knife or a sword archer is really fun in dai bruh i wish that sebastian had more to do and was more fleshed out because i love his backstory i litrally wrote out lore for the vael family because i liked his backstory so much LOL varric's so good kin @ bioware wheres my dwarf romance COWARDS BOI if scout harding isnt a romance in da4 kin also this is just a personal thing BUT the inquisitor better have a large role in da4 since solas is literally either their friend/romance/enemy or a combination of those three i literally wrote a whole ass thing about it right after i read the masked empire LOLOL i think i still have it somewhere but i wrote a whole ass meta about why the inquisitor needs to come back in a large role if miss maevaris tilani aint a companion in da4 what Was the Point big mood alistair's romance is very good though tbh I will always be sad I can’t smooch morrigan as a lady :wack: oop that’s me w cullen LOL SAME also even though I’ve never romanced Solas his friendship still fucks me up hardcore I literally cried the first time I played trespasser back in uhhh 2015 nfbskcjjd wow that was a long time ago right?? some of the animations are kinda cringey but imo yeah the game has aged really well KFHAICJAIJXS the graphics in general are still pretty solid overall too mood though as many times as I’ve played I’ve figured out ways to get out of the hinterlands pretty quick OOP felt that i played mage my first playthrough and oof i died so much in haven i don’t know what’s going on but hail furi :peepoHappy: dope #color-role-channel people's messages are deleted so thats why you don't

"fine w me 👍 " yeah they can't can't drink alcohol either nope but ive listened to the soundtrack oop i think brigham young is referred to as the american moses fun fact a lot of mormons are related to brigham young iohgakjashigdlkjb,sg the golden egyptian tablets that somehow made their way to the americas welcome back doge!! and look at this thing abt mormon afterlife beliefs they believe that in order to go to the celestial kingdom (the highest degree of glory) you have to be sealed in a celestial marriage which basically just means you gotta get married in a mormon temple OGIHSKJEGHOSEKJGS fun fact they also do "worthiness interviews" on people attending your mormon temple wedding (or if you're trying to get into a temple at all) and if you don't pass you can't go 
that happened to my great-aunt and she didn't get to go to her own son's wedding :oope: hell yeah it is hard to leave my mom hasn't been an active member of the church for a longgg time and just a few years ago or so she finally got her records erased from the church because we kept getting missionaries at our door or calling us here lemme find the questions lmfaooo yepp tons of my family are in utah my mom was raised here but her parents come from idaho and utah idaho is big mormon country too huh :0

carmilla's appetite for blood is basically a metaphor for homosexuality and other topics she's in castlevania LMAO i have not read it (just read up on it a lot and watched the webseries based off of the book) but based on my understanding things are kept fairly ambiguous given the time period it's written in but its heavily implied enough that the intent is clear

he will abuse his firework privileges omg alghkjasgha wait this reminds me of the prank my dad did on people in college.. involving fireworks in co they're illegal LMAO but not in texas i think and here people will just drive up to wyoming to get some and then come back makes sense i kno in utah they're not illegal cus when i went to visit my great aunt and uncle there was a fireworks store and my dad and uncle went to get a shitton of fireworks OH so like back in the 80s when my dad was in college people would like slide vinyl covers under doors and fill them with shaving cream and then step on them so it sprayed shaving cream all over someone's dorm and my dad and his roommate at the end of the semeter were like "we're gonna get them back just u watch" and for some reason they decided on using *fireworks* so at the end of the semester they packed their cars and stuff and pulled them up to the front of the dorm building so they could make their escape and they slid fireworks underneath someone's door and lit them and then ran downstairs and drove off I KNWO GISUKJEHS yeah apparently like someone opened the door and there were just smoke and papers floating around the room and the people in the room looked super confused and my dad literally cries with laughter every time he tells this story and the only reason i found out about this is because of dumb and dumber to when harry and lloyd lit off fireworks at this one dude and my dad started laughing so hard he cried and LGKSDJGKLG i don't think so he graduated college and stuff so i dont think he ever got caught LMAO but i was like !?!??!? BRO YOU COULDVE HURT SOMEONE yeah he's like uhhh 57 he acts really serious a good chunk of the time but deep down he's a goofball dont trust that man around fireworks though oh god yeah they're loud af :Wweary2: omg fireworks make me a jump lil cus im really jumpy but i think they're pretty to look at and damb that sounds like it hurts a lot defo defo :Wweary2: GKSDHGJ<MSJGLKSDG i second thai ooooh i'll raemind u ~~if i raemember~~ you can also just try to start a conversation abt things too #multimedia-shabang is for assorted media, #general for everything else huh oop godspeed also need a lotta math oh yeah sure! there u go np :jotaro_dance: and i dont mind much math w science like i enjoyed chem a lot but i hated physics kinda just depends for me i lovedd chem and yeah chem is alright once you know the formulas and when to apply them physics is like bruh u gotta KNOW know yeah can say that w most subjects tbh damn felt that but w physics me: aerospace engineering would be cool
physics: :acbunniewave: 
me: nvm bye girl yeahh i think part of the reason why i struggled so hard w physics is cus my teacher sucked so i felt like i was pulling my hair out trying to teach myself things yeah, that makes a lot of sense for me it also didnt help that it was my first class of the day so i was not a functioning human being :OOF: oop mine didn't really care much abt languages either kinda wish i took sign language from a different class instead of just knockign out french ez peasy i thought it was ~~tho my teacher was also pretty easy on us so that could have smth to do w it~~ :poolsive: yepp my school only offered spanish mandarin and french tho kek i was just abt to :ohwell: i go apeshit for peanut butter peanut butter + chocolate is like crack to me oooh i dunno if I could ever eat it straight outta the jar but i like it in smoothies a lot yeye :0 
i usually just freeze up some banana toss in some milk, cocoa powder, and some Greek yogurt w the peanut butter and it blends up rlly nice its so good :Wweary2: 
rlly convenient breakfast i'd assume peanut butter substitutes work too like sunbutter and almond butter but i havent tried it myself :wethinkin: hell yeah makes sense LMAO oh shit that sucks sm :Wweary2: KLGJDSLHKNGSDJGLKSDG as long as it ain't fatal :ohwell: oh damn one of my friends has the same allergy can't eat any fresh fruit but can eat it if it's cooked yeahh ive heard it's like a pollen allergy more than the actual fruit? but im not sure if that applies to everyone who has it makes sense i have weird skin allergies to cosmetics and plants but that's about it shoutout to the one time i used a moisturizer and it burned and made my face turn red for like 2 days :acisabellebruh: damn oh huh i know pollen/cockroaches/dust are really common in allergic asthma ive seen only one but it was dead in my garage :hh: ghKGJSJKL THEY CAN??!! :owo: mood i don't really mind bees or wasps if they don't bother me 
usually i just ignore em and they go away tho ive never been stung so that might be why i dont really mind them too much 🐝 lmao wasps are black and yellow
hornets are usually black and white p sure 2lbs 13 oz :GnomeDab: i was smol but long my head was verae big though LMAO i think kyo's contact picture for me is one of my fucked up baby photos where i was all red and raw from being forcibly ejected from the womb my brother was 7lbs 11oz :ohwell: ohhhh damb incubator baby twins 💃 GLKDJSGKLSJGL oh jesus oh damn holy shit yikes my parents do be the same ooooof yeah like no one's oppressing you cus you're white and christian :ohwell: there's that whole debate w nature vs nurture and it's mostly like imo
there's a lot that's genetically there and there's not a whole lotta guarantee of what the environment you provide for them will nurture in those children or bring up personality wise/etc that's not to say that adoption is a bad thing, i think very highly about adoption, but there are a lot of variables that you cant be certain of health wise, personality wise, etc and lkgajlguljkasgkjg yeah defo like my mom's adopted and therefore i have like an entire half of my health history missing oh yeah nature vs nurture is always really interesting in the lense of like crime/serial killers esp twin studies are also really interesting also im really strongly of the opinion that if you're going to adopt a kid
you should take them to therapy from an early age because adoption can be inherently traumatic and all that stuff too
can also help offset and give you the tools you need to deal with any behavioral stuff that might crop up since the genetics side of things is so murky and ooo usually when they focus on twins in terms of study they're always identical cus identical genes if you want to purely study the effects of nurture you need to rule out genetics as a confounder and that means you need identical genes tbh most things have a genetic relation but if there is a genetic relation with that esp then it wouldn't be like "a gay gene" it'd be several genes even more than that ISNT THAT FROM RIVERDALE OH LMAO I WAS THINKING OF THIS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqANhkY0hu8 oooh yeah see riverdale goes 
"betty youve got the serial killer gene 😈 you're destined to be a murderer" probs just coincidence yeah scorpio ~~mbti isnt very empirically supported as a personality test~~
~~if u want a good personality measure look at da big 5~~
~~that is my psych major psa of da day~~ https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/ :jotaro_dance: u dont gotta pay for it but this is the personality measure that's most supported by research atm anything that describes something that’s not material feelings, thoughts, qualities, etc sure sure things like love, beauty, forgiveness like those are things that exist but you can’t concretely measure them generally speaking of course took a quick glance at it cus it’s been a while but it’s asking if you’re interested in abstract ideas (things you can’t concretely measure) if you’re asking me questions about it I’d say you have difficulty understanding it lmaoooo oooh enneagram ive taken it before nah that’s MBTI big five is OCEAN:
- openness to experience
- conscientiousness
- agreeableness
- neuroticism big five

“damb okay” and then I had to wait like a year to actually get tested inattentive which is prolly why it went undiagnosed for so long oh yeah 😖 literally me got the “smart but lazy/doesn’t apply herself” label a lot as a kid oo LMAO bruh same 😩 oh shit BAHAH FHSBJCJD they didn’t they made me like symbol match and made me do like spatial reasoning stuff oh and something with like building blocks where i had to like make shapes from those blocks that one made me go ????? kinda? it’s a lot better than it used to be but it was quite messy and bad as a kid it gets a lot worse the more i lose focus/get lazy i have to focus on it to make it decent i remember a lot of the time as a kid id get hw back and it’d be like “i can’t read that” omg same 😩 like you can just see the progression JCBSJJ for me it was like telling my therapist here are my symptoms and then over time she was like “bruh this is like quintessential adhd experience my partner has adhd” 
and then i had to get tested for it to make sure it was indeed that like i was struggling with online school at the time, since my professors put lectures online there was like nothing external making me do it like attending class does, no concrete schedule which made me flounder i did. have a lot of academic issues in the past but they were exacerbated by the complete lack of structure that online school gave me made my procrastinating issues worse and i had such a hard time focusing on those lectures purely because my brain found them so utterly boring a lot of my past issues were stuff like forgetting assignments, or i did like a lot worse in classes i found boring vs ones i found really interesting ofc my experiences aren’t a monolith and that’s not everything that’s just a bit of what my experiences have been like over the years that really contextualized a lot of behaviors for me happy new year! https://tenor.com/view/dio-jojo-youre-approaching-me-jojos-bizarre-adventure-gif-14705619 BAHAHHAHA i second this because of you i have like 5 kpop songs on my on repeat playlist btw guess :ohwell: :feetpics: jk uh lemme look yeah and then fever

wbu :000 so butches are more masculine presenting wlw (usually the term’s applied to lesbians but ive seen bi women use it) and femmes are the inverse, more feminine presenting wlw 

soft butches don’t present as hard masculine as full butches do, it’s mostly an identity thing “what does that mean” HCBSHCHAIHXIS yeah i was thinking soft butch she still has someone feminine qualities with the way she presents herself hmmmm was gonna mention kepler but she would also be soft butch methinks oh boy they keep the engine clean it removes dirt and stuff so you don’t develop sludge in your car oh no, not judging at all i didn’t know this (i don’t know anything about cars outside of this) until my dad told me so just regurgitating what ive been told LOL oh yeah driving in traffic is awful i dunno what blinker fluid is 😩 ooo not any of the lesbians i know irl but it’s apparently bad enough of a thing for lesbians that it’s called uhauling :problem: like the joke goes “what does a lesbian bring on a second date”
“a u-haul” (rental move it yourself trailers for non-americans) it’s primarily an american stereotype im p sure ahh yeah :/ that one makes me sad cus a lot of bi women feel like they’re not “gay enough” or are even told that by other lgbt people for dating men or being attracted to them oooh and damn, sorry to hear that :C (abt the illegal to be lgbt part) damn :C yeah, i hope you’re able to safely leave somewhere you can feel happy safe and accepted ❤️ ope don’t wanna clock your friend or anything but that is… a lowkey gay thing to say ahhh hey, don’t apologize for it that kinda thing can be really tough and hard to deal with, especially with the “what-ifs” that can be attached o shit yuh HELL YEAH ugh that's always the worst :nu:  like a good chunk of the time the point of fiction is that they're. not real ROFL LMAO you're good hell yeah i might 😈

was friends with popular people but not exactly popular myself, also friends with lgbt people who were regularly ostracized so i was kinda just an in-betweener. was also an ap kid but i did alright in those classes™️ weird era tbh 100% most of the time a lot of hs kids are just in a weird era in their lives growing, finding themselves. none of them are ever surface layer and there's always more to them than you think depth™️ yeah i would've been friendly with y'all too oop oh my god i hated kids like that i remember when my choir teacher was on maternity leave and some kids in my choir class made the sub cry 😭 that was fucked up ^ yeah exactly like oh hey he's here today ™️ look at you lil genius over here LMAO IKGJESGHESLKGHG shit i was terrible at math failed algebra 1 my freshman year and had to go to summer school 🙄 🙏 LMAO kyo rolling up to class https://tenor.com/view/i-know-more-than-you-i-know-you-smarter-smarty-pants-glaring-gif-15654642 oh yeah that always made me cry cus i thought the way they taught things was so confusing like if i did it my way i'd get it right and but then theyd be like no u didnt do it the way it was taught :clownin: BAHAAHAHAHHA see another thing about math for me is that its REALLY REALLY easy for me to make simple mistakes cus of all the steps (thanks adhd) and so a lot of the time i would accidentally miss steps but then they'd just mark me down completely instead of giving me half points 🙄 

my senior year math teacher was great tho i miss u xo oh mood what'd you struggle with in chem yeah that's fair oop i can help if you need it i may not be great at math but i am good at chemistry math oh wtf ew EW reminds me of my senior year of hs... my first class.. physics :nu: no thanks yeah gross YES i never had gym in the morning in hs was always my last class (so many kids would just sneak out :ahaha: ) rip we never had to run a mile or anything for some reason we just did fuck all gym teacher would make us walk a lap outside though i almost got bit by a snake when i did that lap once scary BAHAHA OH MY GOD YEAH i only had to do the pacer in middle school but my asthma would kick my ass but then all the boys would just take that shit SO seriously ^^ GHSJKGHGKJ SAME like "oh... he's still going...?" 
"... still going.... he looks like he's gonna pass out" ooh so true GIJKSEGHKESGHKS oooh my hs had a weight room but i never got to go in there :nu: sad i would always get a peek and i'd wanna go in but they reserved it for the strength and conditioning class and also football team methinks yeah ooh damn lucky damn that sounds great no i forgot but ill listen to it now since u reminded me i like the beat yeah i like this sounds like a synth is that the one with the really bad instrumentals i felt like my eardrums were being grated like cheese anyways this reminds me of the girl i was friends with in hs in my french class who would always show me kpop videos in the middle of class like we'd be stuck in the library in class sharing earbuds and watching kpop music videos :nu: oh shit 👀 yeah what of it it 😤🤚 possessing infinite wisdom. guarding the gates damn the last time discord's guidelines were updated was may 2020 :thonk: nothing in discord's guidelines says anything abt that being a thing tho so it might just be some kinda weird joke :shrug: discord has access to private information but i'm pretty sure they're not allowed to disclose it, and discord *can* and *does* work with law enforcement but there are some records that i'm pretty discord can't publicly disclose something like that especially when it's not pertinent (not to mention that if an offense were happening through discord, discord would just archive the account to keep evidence for law enforcement and ban them) 'cus i checked the guidelines and the last time it was updated was may 2020 and it said nothing about this sort of thing discord doesn't mess around with that sort of thing he really was green obv p sure yeah it's common knowledge, yeah or at least should be welcome!! happy birthday @Angelaa !! ofc!! :twinkleheart: hope it's a good one!
