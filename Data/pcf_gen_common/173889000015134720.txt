pansexual is NOT just for trans people, as trans people are their binary genders. pansexual isn’t even just for non-binary people. pansexuality is moreso you’re attracted *regardless* of gender. as in, you don’t really care about their gender and you don’t have any specific preferences. the meanings may overlap but there’s still a distinction, and so it’s important to not invalidate either one np :Hearts: but it’s still up to you how you wanna identify yk? there are people who consider themselves pan but still use the label bi because they like it more, it’s easier to explain, the colors are prettier, etc. it’s all personal preference really bc u did a shit definition drew no i’m not like shitting on u or anything hshshdhf hi strife :AirHearts: no problem gl :ASno: cool ayo second dose down :CH_Swag: yesss i hope you’re doing well lu! gm idk gm lu :wolf_heart: hope you’re doing well gl its not automatic u gotta ask a staff for it ~~bc someone was too lazy to set it up~~ yiz np np ^^ :minathumb: the only thing sims 4 has over sims 3 is CAS imo everything else sims 3 > lol same hi ily2 i hope you’re doing well mmm it’s been okay, nothin’s really changed (good or bad) for i can join after dinner idk if i’ll talk tho oops i fell asleep my computer got completely frozen so i had to force shut off and now it isn’t turning on :e_minor: lovely watching twitch but i was asleep for like an hour before i came back to it frozen and nothing was open so idk oh this is in minecrafr not rly mm i mean ig the closest thing to a spam channel would be #robo-lab-bots alright nah kyo be shit talking vapes 1 or 3 sjkdjks my vc senses were tingling whenever i say shonny in my head i hear shawty oh lu babe @Arzaylea good luck on your overnight :tlCatHeart: take care of yourself! you got this :KiraraHugHeart: love you toooo SLSJDKDJK and we love you for it oli london but yea thats pretty scary sounds like it'd be a horror short i’ve never played the games so idk ponged ah dam punt him across the room kick 👏 him 👏 :kick: why does summer have to exist :e_minor: i’m dying as a heat intolerant ginger no bueno rn it’s like 90 yea i apologize for america sir- i live in the north it’s not supposed to be like this :peepoCry: yes ty shonny see i love sweaters lol long-sleeved, oversized anything that’s my shit wow we’re like opposites

and then if u wanted u could add a + sign on the right for the TQIA**+** well queer encompasses anyone not cishet which would include a lot of characters lol zeph for A i think so unless u wanna include characters that aren’t het but don’t have their sexualities explicitly stated (like poppy) but that might be a lot ? gaius is here for bi lol poppy can be included too i’m just giving suggestions for viv she can decide what she wants to do they might’ve already been included in the lesbian but i could be wrong- i never got a good look at it see that’s where it gets complicated, bc then that’s playersexual i meant characters that, outside of the player, have dated or had experiences with multiple genders but myra wasn’t stated was she? i thought it was just fanon so stuff being implied counts? well cuz rae said “explicitly stated by themselves or pb” so i just wanna make sure and that’s why i said poppy
cuz she does the same
and ik viv likes her so i wanted to give her the option of including her she had a thing with chloe that’s subjective tho?
gaius could be a villain to other ppl in ur eyes not everyone sees it the same yeah ok that’s fine that’s u what um dude TQIA+ queer is the Q where ok but not everyone feels that way i don’t even like her dude!!! this is literallt just about pride IM LITERALLT NOT OMFG that’s why i was asking about implying vs explicitly stating I was added bc of the shared experiences with the lgbt community. some consider themselves lgbt, some don’t. it’s like the nb being trans thing best friend in TNA encouraging u to get it on with ur boss owa owa it’s u @ lu with that guy at her work lmao sadie and zadie can both step on me hypothetically no bingo for me u missed the free trial, pay $6969 to continue oop yes ma’am :ExKirbyWalk: ‘shove it up ur ass’ oh- mood lmao what’s a 5150 i don’t speak smart oh ok ty sick 🧍 henlo :hy_babyrun: if u do .serverinfo in #robo-lab-bots u can see it a bit bigger np! :AG_Yikes: yay ily2 gj at work :hy_nezukoyay: mornin yes ma'am i'll remind u when i wake up alrighty pog how was work today aww thats wonderful im glad it was good ^^^ u da best :tlFoxCuddleHug: same :AG_SubaThink: tempting :huggies: have u taken anything okai, hope it gets better!! suggestions on what to get from wendys ty shon and rae

if that all makes sense? didnt seem like being fictional mattered to u when u were going off about poppy but ok u completely missed my point go girl u deserve it grr i looked it up and omg looks like heaven mama needs a break mama boutta have a breakdown :tea: what toppings niceeeeee sounds fuckin :perfect: it belongs wherever you put it nah why do ppl take this so seriously lmao just let ppl eat what they like yess thats fine same loll it tastes like FEET custard, good

second of all, BITCH WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO it was cute ilysm lu likes that rich minimalist aesthetic ✨ i used to have one for my 5 lmaoo heavy af cute case > sturdy case i used to have such a cute cat case but it was silicone so it didnt last too long mine is galaxy oh the actual phone rose gold nah i got the super rare super cool galaxy limited phone color i wouldve loved to get the red one to match with my 3ds discontinued twinsies ahaha 6s plus it still works pretty well, the only problem is the battery drains rlly fast ive become super attached to it tho bc it has both the headphone jack and the fingerprint id and i refuse to give those up i’m interested to see the results i just got jumpscared by my phone emergency weather alert went BEEEEEP BEEEEEP loud as fuck thoight the purge was going on i was shittin i mean- i had the anesthesia so i was only just super sleepy i think mine was 4k, 1k for each tooth yo so the hurricane’s gonna hit my area tomorrow morning around 8 so i may not be as active for a bit depending on power ✌️ oh good, you stay safe too! what’d u think nice oop there goes my power YES IT IS IM SO GLAD YOU ASKED HE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE BEST BOY ye they’re both v good love it i do not sounds cool tho and in the case that you were asking if i would like to know the origin then yes i would oop no i’ve actually never heard it before thankss :CS_Heart: :CS_Nod: oh no skshdkd well i don’t dislike or like- i don’t rlly know what it is i just use emotes laksks *knock* excuse me sir do u have a moment to talk about our mom and savior lu bear my power’s back weee could’ve dmed but okay anyways my allergies are fucking me up rn lmao my eyes are so watery from sneezinG :03_kittyAAAA: oh also happ bday meant to say that like ten other times but my little baby brain kept forgetting to hit send :wolf_heart: he gone dipped his toe in the water then scrammed :AreYouSure: thnks hang in there babe ❤️ :YuEmiThumbsUp: :GhostAw: i love that for you you deserve all the compliments well they already made a PSA post about it so they probably know they fucked up at least a little its pb, you know how they are with holding themselves accountable for anything until after two months i think theyre doing this because of the current price of vip. trying to actually make it worth $15 i domt think they would raise it they said they're sending a letter etc. to the teams so maybe they'll change something cuz a lot of ppl are pissed yeah but im hoping this time the backlash will be big enough. cuz it was the last nail in the coffin for a lot of players we'll have to see oh we should prolly move to #choices-chat now mine means gray wood 🧍 thats my ass nop :smolSadgeSit: peasant el lu instead of snapping lu puts the stones in her ass and claps with that :nyansmilebig: both, both is good :3sWhat: it keeps going back and forth between hana and alana 1 hr :CB_sad: can u post since it didnt win i wanna see you can date her so yes she’s a romantic interest i dated the main 3 in a cute poly relationship which, and i cannot say this enough, more books need to have okay but that doesn’t mean poly can’t be an option i’ll say november i don’t rlly understand why y’all are so pressed abt kat tbh. if she streams choices and has fun with it, and pb recognizes her, where’s the harm? every popular streamer once started at 0 views, and the replies to the tweet shows that she already has at least a few fans. she’s a small streamer who loves choices and so pb shouts her out to both help her grow while also getting more people interested in their game. if she can keep doing what she enjoys and bring more people entertainment i just don’t get why it’s such a big deal? well maybe kat reached out to them and not the other way around whatever. i’m just tired of you guys insulting this person when she doesn’t even seem to be doing anything wrong. oh dam but he got that 6’2 huh 👁️ rip mission failed, we’ll get em next time ah good luck! you got this ❤️ in case a hot guy ever asks for one yuh :AlyStare: the penguin dude unique OMG THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT SHE IS LMAOOO "She is a one-of-a-kind unique creature, hence her name." from the wiki ksdjfskdfsdk im crying well gee no wonder he was my favorite :YuPenguinStab: sharp rocks :SenkoOfCulture: OH i was playing spiritfarer and in it there's a frog guy who's the protag's uncle and he talks about our aunt viv so congrats u married a forg!! its rlly good it yeah it does but like a bittersweet way sdkjskd oo i havent omg its so cute aw it looks so fun i’m the spicy ramen ive never had legit ramen i rlly want to tho mmm theres like two chinese places and one japanese i think theres a hibachi place somewhere too lmao probably carnival food slaps america super good fair food just hits different come to ct skdjksd my dad basically breathes grits our dads are like twins johns and grits awh no loll im the only ginger in my immediate family :SCsobbing: nah my color is actully ginger i have a blonde streak on like the back of my head tho yuhh lol omg viv coem to my house for thanksgiving >:( gravy slaps drizzle that shit on everything yes we can bring our favorite dishes yea my fam's thanksgiving: turkey, ham, stuffing, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, butternut squash, corn, mac & cheese, cranberry sauce, gravy, dinner rolls, cornbread, chicken pot pie, pumpkin pie.

against the rules? forcing a student into a position that they don’t want and didn’t sign up for don’t take the guilt it’s hard but it’s so important to learn how to stand up for yourself and put your comfort first it’s not selfish and it’s not rude, it’s taking care of your own well-being i get that. but it’s your life, not your parents. it sounds like you’re doing well in school which is something to be proud of, and if they’re not then that’s their problem. parents always want to act like their kids owe them or have to reach certain standards which is not at all true. live how you want. if you’re happy or comfortable that’s all that should matter which is definitely easier said than done when you’re still living with them. and if they are giving you problems that make you feel this way i’m sorry you have to deal with that :modCheck: yall hear smth? gives you wings ninki minjaj yuh if youre 18+ its in the nsfw chan just need to ask for the role fair :waitwha: :AA_SMH: horse lmaooo no worries i do that too looking at random statuses and bios is my favorite pastime :nyasSpin: yes valentine matchup i cant :CB_pepe_hands: oh good cuz i was so confused what this meant 😂 :KiraraHmm: i might i might welcome welcome @keepcreative @Astra <3 hi!! feel free to grab some roles #roles and a color #color-role-channel enjoy your stay! :D owie i hate when that happens also for this i'd say go for it if you like him as a person and you'd be okay with the possibility that you might stay only friends MAISON my first song was SCream so it holds a special place in my heart @Bequlund welcomee + nb thanks nonbinary :PeekingDuck: da full pic that unfortunately doesn’t fit in pfp skdjdkdh i just looked up kawaii art and scrolled for two hours :ASkek: ayo ya i got stuck to my couch lmaooo welcome welcome everyone coming in!! like flowers!!! :misa_flower_NF2U: hihi! thats okay! we love our lurkers too thats like me watching horror game videos at two in the morning :yooadead: :NODDERS: we're too lovable mhm SDKJFKSDJF NOT THE DOLL it do be cute tho theres a live action??? the comments are turned off sldfskdlf OH WHAT THE FUCK DID THEY DO TO MY GIRL FRANKIE I???? ooh interesting draculaura looks cute at least :raccoonroll: kyo: cute anime? nah screaming raccoon :03_kittyAAAA: welcome! @Jace Lightbourne lu and her demon dog :o we just became the cutest chat in existence love that for us @Sunay welcome! love the loki pfp frfr omg yes give us more villain LIs por favor ksdfd same i was gonna say aerin but hmm nah ye oh no babe again?? ughh ew wtf my mom's boss tested posi but she said she doesn't hang out with him so ugh that sucks umm i think it takes a few days? im not sure welcome btw @Marywars @Sneaky Shadows :FroggieBirdWave: damn i'm fae the resident fae of COURSE she gave birth to us 200 kids it was a medical marvel the coolest lu is short for lunchables np np :BC_nod: @Fly Junior welcome! @TheBoxOfPlague welcomee feel free to get some roles #roles and a color #color-role-channel @phl87 welcome too!! @MidnightShadowRose welcome welcome @;) @DogfartsMcGee :misa_wave_NF2U: i like ur username and pfp lol welcome @MattisWhoIAm ! welcomeee love ur rakan pfp!! welcome everyone coming in! :Nekowave: ooh good choices 10 billies out of 10 @tinkerbell welcomee nice!! glad to have ya here :HappyWow: ilym :nyaMwah2: slkfjdsl probably next week october and nah never too early for spooky month :tlwHalloweenSkeleton: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lmaooo i think i might go pyramid head but i might also go a dbd killer :AA_Think: watch me just have a new pfp every week LOL FACTS you do two ~ ~~like dis~~ ofc ofc 💕 :03_catscrem: well i already did change it to skyler hehehe i do wish i could pull off like a cool unique name but im da whitest lil white boi ahh yeah i changed it as soon as i hit 18 aw tyy :hyONLY_mascot_blush: sdhsjka' you look like the type of sexy bitch who would have a galactic name like beyonce but instead its ✨ andromeda youre the only asian girl i know LMAO YEAH :peepoCowboysling: the percentage of my town is probably like 60 white, 20 black, 5 latino, <5 asian i remember there being an asian girl in my school but i dont remember her name LOLLL ew oh i was way off :WhatEven: i’m looking for my yearbook it’s that time fellas woohoo happy fall!!1!1!
