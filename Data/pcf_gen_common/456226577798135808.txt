Ahhh that Amanda Seyfried picture looks so TRR! :GWfateeSip: Me too 🍿 Guilty until proven innocent :GWfateeSip: @jiminverse that's trademarked by me x.x >stab ya game up
Lmao Same tbh, Kezz As Kezz put it: "We did it for relationship points, your honour." @jiminverse bring me some more too, dear daughter Just caught up to the chat. Damn this is good stuff. CW should take notes @Kezz das coffee x.x As a coffee lover I'm offended I feel it's the other way around, Willi I get the vibe Feenie doesn't like other Choices servers Like he wants to be the only one there is Yeah Kezz is right "Both" 9 /r/theydidthemath ^ @Fiona he isn't like that only here tbh I can dig up probably a 100 screenshots like that It's not English. It's British. It's like the same as english but an entirely different language at the same time Yeah bollocks is common lol Yeah kinda If even his Mods are calling it BS, that should give you a general idea of what the situation is like Lol true Yeah that...comes with manage messages permission 130 something Idk Tbh Wooow rude x.x Mods need to be valued. Problem with that server is
1. Over 100 or so members with only 1 person that has somewhat of a power, that being the server owner
2. That server owner himself trying to create drama, making sexual comments etc etc It's a mess yeah Ik the perfect way to describe that server "Trump's America" :GWworkshopAkaShrug: Agreed, Hilda I was really happy when Willi got ownership ...then she transferred it back to Feenie *sigh* She ye Also for clarification, I'm a she too, despite my username being pretty...boyish 😂 I remember when I used to confuse everyone in the server. Good times Silver is a pretty boyish one tbf but hey, if UD says it can be both male and femake, I'll take it Lol Yeah "Most of the powerful leaders in the world are corru-"
"That's cool and all but did you hear about the pronouns problem" Idr tbh It's like 1 am here. Although it's weekend I should really be sleeping lol > be me
> be a doctor in training
> don't take care of your own self It's about 1 am here 1:08 to be exact but yeah @Kezz we should've met ugh x.x x.x Oh well G'night fellas. Stay Hydrated ™ Oh and one more thing. I *think* I'll start hanging out here more. This seems like a cool place And ye Fiona is really cute c: Notte. Mornin' :GWllentNicoPeek: That, technically. But I just woke up at that time so that's why Morning x.x Hmmm Either looks fine tbh I'll go with lowercase because why not The Sloane is uppercase. ;o Impeach! I know I know x.x Yes! :GWqlabsBan: :GWuraOchakoEvil: It does that all the time lol It also does some...other stuff For e.g. It starts with No better album than Hybrid Theory It also says lmao when you say ayy Ayy Ik a lot about Ub3r lol Been using it since uhhh 20th March of last year It's fucking 34 C here I'll remember you in my prayers Florence ™ @Fiona kinda https://snew.github.io/r/discordapp/comments/94ib94/what_are_these_bots_joining_public_servers/ I suggest banning em too Some of these also joined a server I am a Mod in Any NF fan here? :GWllentNicoPeek: NF yeah Haii guys c:
I have something in mind, but first. Any experienced roleplayers here? @9k4 a roleplay server for one of choices' books For e.g. hero or tcatf etc :GWfateeSip: We once tried a TCATF server, but Feenie being the guy he is, I got angry and deleted the important channels in that server :GWfateeSip: @9k4 OCs only tho But welp we'll decide on that later Yes ;o Anyway Who is the owner of this server again? Psychobaby who is psychobaby ;o Oh Viv Gonna discuss this with Viv and hear his/her/their thoughts about it Well we can't really do all the books at once Kezz *Unfriended* @Tyr hmmm TCATF, Hero, oh AME can be fun tbh @Tyr yeah that too I'll deal with that dw I'll discuss this with Viv Anyway since Viv is the owner of this server, if everything goes right, I'll have her host a poll about which book we should base our RP on. The book that wins, we'll make an RP of it Lmao Yeah I don't really like Zeke I'm too much of a sweetheart x.x Which is why I'll secretly be Villa- oh ok nvm I got a partner can't back out now Ok so the people that will be helping me set shizz up will be @Kezz and @Fiona Or  @Tyr hmmm I don't want more than 3 people (imcluding me) to be working on this Otherwise too many people would know the plot, if there is one @9k4 no no no no no I've tried one channel for a whole roleplay with this many members Trust me, it's a clusterfuck All the stuff happening in the same channel, it gets hard keeping track of what's even happening Sure But we need to first decide on what book we woll even be doing It seems only fair to decide it through a poll since all members will get a say in that Gotta give the people what they want ES is uhhh You see ES is a mystery book And since it has ended All the mysteries have already been revealed So it won't be as fun Hmmm that's possible We love you too c: Discord's Most Eligible ba dum tss I've DMed Viv Gonna see what they think Did someone say Fullmetal ;o Fullmetal Alchemist 💯 Just saw Asian squad role on Viv so Viv is probably sleeping rn lol Gonna take a while to decide I mean...ahem F Gtg for now I'll be back soon hopefully Ciao c: >let down :GWchinaSakuraThinking: Subnautica <3 Never played it but I've really liked it from what I've seen so far @jiminverse wambs will you be watching the match I wanna support RM but my Italian blood is making me feel guilty for doing that x.x I am at least...to myself so far I'm talking about football, the rest are about games Basically Real Madrid duhhhh Barca is a good team but ehhhh Real Madrid > It's uhhh Going May Pizzus Chrust bless you for that wonderful deed That's...what he said yes Ik I am Italian but like...I wouldn't really like to know when anyone eats an Italian dish everytime lol Lol No idea lol Lol Like I know they are eating an Italian dish wow very cool but idk why they feel the need to tell an Italian everytime they do lol Ooook Hilda and Doge calm down plz. I don't like it when my pets fight @jiminverse idk eho to support difvisjdnskd Uhhh What @jiminverse heeeey I want to support RM But the Italian in me is making me feel guilty about it THEY WHAT Holy shit Well that was to be expected And well Wambs I can see why Spurs lost tbf No Lloris, Kane, Dele, were Eriksen and Son playing? Lol I'll check on FotMob Lmao Also Wambs "A por la 13" means "towards the 13th" or something We already won 13th 😂 Lol I like our lineup Ceballos my lad <3 And Isco too sibejdhdjdj I really liked Ceballos in the previous match Sad he didn't play as much under ZZ A really big waste of talent tbh But ZZ won us 3 in a row so I won't complain about ZZ Lol Not much just talking about the most superior sport Good question Next one please That's the son of Barca's coach actually Iirc He did good in the last match from what I saw Idk tbh I might be misremembering 😂 Yeah I think I'm misremembering Oh well Yeah he isn't I confirmed it from an anonymous source He is just unfortunate to share the same last name as a Barca coach **Kezz** is typing... @Kezz tis oki c: Lol Lol I'm the opposite I don't mind spoilers at all @jiminverse Carvajal that fucking... Lmao Karma is a messi Don't do dis to me x.x "Our" I only read the headline and thought... 😂 Italians are raiding us! x.x *Realizes she is Italian* Fuck Marcelo ain't gonna leave Ronaldo left because he wasn't supported by Flo in his tax case thing Marcelo is a Madridista through and through He won't leave It's not impossible But highly unlikely "could" He definitely will lol Don't just believe any rumour Heeey Ah yeah they will def try And will likely fail Isco smh Lmao I love Roma's twitter account BALE YOU MOTHER- Hmm Benzema probably Hmm wait Yeah it's Benz Fkn brick Stepping down more like 5 goals in league is not acceptable from fkn Real Madrid's starter Those reflexes from Keylor tho in the Carva OG :GWworkshopAkaShrug: HOLY FUCK BALE That Was masterclass Lol Juve...that's why they bought him You know who else scored a bicycle? Against his new club? :GWvertiPeepoSadMan: I'll be listening to somgs in VC until 2nd half starts OMG VINI AND ASENSIO FUCK YEAH THAT FKN PASS Lmao Asensio to Vini to Asensio Fkn topkek @Fiona @Kezz got approval from Viv. I'm ready to begin when you guys are Roleplay server Yup @jiminverse we look better with our youngsters on than our starters lol ASENSIOOOOOO Wambs you so damn behind lol Uhh what Oh lol Download acestream I'm watching on that too since I like my volume high and everyone else is sleeping lol Oh iPad nvm Thought you were watching on PC while typing on mobile or somethin Yeah lol We live in same timezone kek Ceballos off Gg from my baby My son Yeah Made a good save too @Fiona sure. In a bit tho lol Damn Llorente <3 @Fiona we aren't gonna start roleplaying right away lol I got you and Kezz to help me set the server up A lot of stuff And for clarification the roleplaying server won't be ready for quite a while lol Yeah @jiminverse Holy fuck that Lunin save Seriously that was like Ultra Instinct 90% of keepers are letting that in anyday That save is godly And Oblaks and DDGs and Neuers But ye @jiminverse LUNIN DUDBDJDJD That Lunin save on free kick was goood Night Wambs I should sleep too 2 am fuuu :GWllentNicoPeek: Not for now it's just a casual RP rn @Tyr join us? c: :GWowoHehe: Yeah So uhhh Viv wanted to practice RP but she went offline so uhhh Have to wait I guess Lol No don't I have to discuss it first if we should consider it or not Lmao x.x Depends. How do you wanna start? This is practice for you so should be your choice, I believe. Hmmmmmm You wanted to see how you'll handle convo with 2 people right? We should get 1 more person then Ayyy How about we start with a normal conversation first? Kind of Roleplay is controlled by the action of players mostly Yeah what Furi said Oh we have to be OCs Not existing characters No you don't have to make everything detailed Like be a normal person Yeah You don't have to tell others e ery trait about yourself. You just have to have a general idea yourself and that's it Hmmm It doesn't have to be a choices book tbh. It's just a practice RP afterall Lmao *Silver is at that same bus stop, impatoently tapping her feet while waiting for the next bus, since she overslept and missed the previous bus and is now late for work.* Yeah I can see this being confusing lol POWERGAMING REEEEE U fkn wot now Fuck it let's approach @9k4's dead body or something "...last I checked dead guys don't fart..." "Suuure. Don't come crying if they find you poking it and then arrest you for the murder." "Uh huh. Well it actually is worth checking if he is dead or only unconscious." "...do you intend to feel his pulse with a stick? A fucking stick? Seriously?" ~~join me in general vc for music thx~~ (Lmao) *Sirens can be heard in the distance, seemingly growing closer and closer as the time passes. Few moments later, a police car stops just a few meters from the group and the dead body.* *One of the cops makes his way toward the dead body. He kneels down to check the pulse and confirm that he is indeed dead.* (Btw when playing different characters, use other symbols etc to put their quotes in. For e.g. I quoted Silver in, well, quotation marks. But I'll quote the officer in equals sign) =No. You can't.= *He says as he turns to Furion.* =Judging by the state of the body, this murder must be commited only recently. Did any of you three see anyone else dragging this body here or something like that?= =Hmm, very well.= *He then turns to the other two with a serious and intimidating expression on his face.* =Did any of *you* two see or hear something like that?= Oh oki =I see...what's that stick you are holding, may I ask?= *He says, pointing at the stick she is still holding* =A...what? Were you poking the corpse with that stick...?= Np c: *Furion is offended* I had no idea what was going on in the RP all that time but it was still fun to do lol Drilling sucks the most oml don't even get me started I'm gonna murder one of my neighbours some day @azula for talk or music I don't wanna talk I'm kinda shy x.x Thx c: :GWfateeSip: I'll join VC Won't talk tho Brb in few mins Leave and join again perhaps No idea what's happening then lol Do et again Turn it off and again Ez Gotta leave now x.x I'll still be om discord prolly Y tho? x.x Where you from ;o I see :GWllentNicoPeek: 14-5-2 for AME cheesus https://youtu.be/I8RbjeLH97s This is perffff to use in action movie trailers @jiminverse do you have a FPL team Here is mine @Kezz ye ikr CAH was killed For EU countries at least By CAH I mean pretend you are xyzzy Lol Feenie be like From what I heard yeah I left all his groups and server etc when he was inactive so I don't really know much I'd rather take a server with like, 20 great members who get along with each other pretty well than a server with 200 members which is barely any good at all He can have a 1000 members and he'll still be shit :GWworkshopAkaShrug: Not like he is why all of those members are there. They are there for choices and as a new member that server looks decent enough so they stick around. That's it really I never really got around to liking Naruto lol Naruto is legendary Tho I've never watched it But you don't need to be a regular watcher to tell I'm watching HxH I was basically forced at gunpoint by friends x.x Gimme my romcom x.x I really love Your Lie In April Just Let it out man get well soon, please take care and get medical help if need be! Did you get banned from Feenie's server?  @Raven 3 What the hell You barely did anything Omg How dare you! That's literally a S I N 😤 Also, I didn't even know the "*" was for admins, I thought it was just for people to make their usernames fancy LMAO People should be able to know who's an admin by looking at their roles, majority won't pay much attention to asterisks on either side of a name I know Which is why the asterisks rule is unnecessary That's my point People can just look at the role, no one gives a damn about "*" Also, he barely enforces the rules It's become his own personal server He said so himself I saw that on the chat That's so stupid Man, I'm starting to prefer this server more nO oThEr LaNgUaGeS He does realise that he can mention them even if they have those symbols? You can just find the person's last message, if you're on a phone then tap their name or right-click on a computer Also didn't he make a rule about @ing people unnecessarily 😕 When? How'd you guys know he faked it? Hmm, is it a good idea to bring this all up in a public server? You guys can just DM me and explain if you want Damn I'm gonna see if I can find it Alrighty Thank ye Damn, that was a bit of a read I don't think it's a good idea to send him anything, it is what it is If he wants to be immature, let him be immature. You've still got this server and sending him that will just escalate the argument even more, there's no point. At least, that's my view on it. I don't want to get involved in anything but do what you feel is right. I guess that's why I was called ~*amazeballs*~ lmao Isn't he like 18 or 19 Ehh, you'd be surprised at people's levels of maturity when it comes to age I've spoken to a seventeen year old who acted younger than me I used to moderate a server and she made super rude comments towards another user who was like a 12 year old So I confronted her and she pulled out the "MY SISTER WAS ON MY ACCOUNT" excuse I resigned from moderating there so not my problem anymore ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I mean since that isn't my slur to reclaim, I can't dictate what is or what is not racist but from what I know, it's still racist despite the ending of the word. And it isn't Feenie's slur to reclaim either considering he's Chinese, Indian and English from what he's said. And he should've just admitted he was wrong or not brought up such a controversial topic and then victimise himself wth And "dumb fuck", that's real mature If you're genuinely trying to get into a logical debate then maybe refrain from just insulting the hell out of the other person? Oh, I've noticed. Sometimes I joke around and be like "DON'T INSULT MACKENZIE" but there's an extent, I still respect other people's opinions about most things and hear out their perspectives. No, I heard about it briefly but I didn't get to see the actual thing It's fine, Mackenzie will just sabotage the people who insult her and get on with her day like the petty queen she is. But I do agree, she must be protected I saw that part, yesyes I believe I DMed you to check why you left or something? ...Cooking Hey, you know what makes a great administrator on a server for an interactive story game? Knowledge on how much sugar you have to put into this special stew! If you know how to cook, you know how to administrate 😍😍😍 That's just outright petty Smh I mean, I would be annoyed as well if I was in your position so I don't blame you You defended him and got backlash for it yet continued to stand your ground for him and he repays you by banning you from his server Isn't that lovely The moderating system there sucks if I'm being honest You can't just randomly give out mod to people Can people who have the moderator role ban others or nah? Like on Feenie's server Okay because I was concerned when Feenie just gave me mod out of nowhere I was a little surprised and I messaged my good friend about it like "hey, I just randomly got promoted to mod somewhere lmao" and my friend goes "ban everyone" which I said "no" because I wouldn't do that but it made me think about if it were someone else in my position They could've easily messed up the server just like that So I feel like the system on his server for hiring moderators and admins is a bit flawed because it should be a little more serious? When I used to moderate, I had to go through a process of sending in an application before being considered, they then judged me on how active I was and how much I followed the rules and whatnot. I think that was a good system. It would work much better It's okay, it helps to rant sometimes. Good luck at school and goodnight! Oh, he still does that I can see why you and many others left, aah I read something about him calling it his personal server recently Ehh, I'm starting to see what's wrong with that server now That sucks honestly, I'd assume they're referring to Feenie's server? They should let multiple servers be advertised, it's not too big a deal and every app/game tends to have a few normally @azula Thank you! I'm glad I joined as well, I think I found this server through reddit actually? If you scroll up, Dono, there was some stuff explaining why the other server isn't the best. "Kaitlyn incident"
 "you all grouped up on him" 
Can't tell if you are calling Kaitlyn a him or not People didn't group up against him just for shits and giggles, Willi. It's because they don't like him as a person.
"People who bash him just because they heard from others"
See this part is just like you saying you are siding with Feenie because you are his friend. Likewise those people you mention went against him because they sided with the side that was against him, the ones that had bad experiences with him, because they are their friends.
Also, usually you won't judge others based on what others say. If one person says he's bad, ok. 2? Ok. But if at least 4 people are saying the same about him, you know there's at least something to it.
Viv said it best, I think. Keep it constructive plz x.x Is my school okay I just found a demerit for being out of uniform on Monday which was logged in at 10:27am I came to school late, maybe at around 11:30, and I was in the correct uniform tf obviously no one cares but i needed somewhere to express how absolutely puzzled i am at the management of my school @oge it starts at 9:00 but i had reason for being late that day, had a note and all that's not the point though, it's that they've given me a demerit for something i didn't do nor was i there to do @oge it's like a strike/warning, once you get to a certain amount you get a detention and i don't want to have a false warning on my record so i'm going to question the teacher about it thank you :) Some are quite good but a lot can be generic There's one author who has some really good art scenes in her stories but I can't really think of anything you might like? I prefer Choices to Episode tbh There was a story called The Dragon's Tail but it got discontinued, it was really good though Different to other stories on Episode The art was really good As well as the directing and all that from what I remember but it unfortunately got discontinued as I mentioned above i just hooked up with talia in the love island game hell yeah I didn't even know it was a thing yeah except the diamond options are like 5-10 diamonds and you can earn like 2 diamonds a chapter like choices some of the chapters are short and boring but i'm just playing to get with talia lmao also the character designs are a bit... weird @Greenberry That looks rad! Y'all, what even @Raven 3 u have an amazing profile photo Hilda is the sweetest and that's facts 💘💘💘 Play it my dude I haven't even finished TF2 💀 Ooooooo Lol aaaand i'm definitely not straight talia is 💯🔥 🙌 love island: the game  @Greenberry AWW, SO C U T E!!! 
congratulations!  @Raven 3 @Greenberry she is very cool indeed i'm so kind i'm writing an analysis for this group performance i had to do where my group didn't really care about it and one of the questions was "what will you do to improve for next time?" and i was so tempted to write down "join a different group" @Dono "What is wrong with this group?" "Oh, basically everything :)" jk

In short, it was for my performing arts class, the assignment was to perform this little scene which we would rehearse. The actor in me was stoked but my group rarely listened and we couldn't even get one full rehearsal done despite being given weeks. We were so unprepared, I'm sure many marks got deducted. I'm pretty sure I got so frustrated with them that I just stood up and walked away at one point because there was no point @oge I wish I could but it's a bit informal in this case @Tyr I'm regarded as "the smart one" by my class so people tend to depend on me a lot. Group projects aren't bad, it depends on who I'm with but you're right, there have been multiple occasions where others have banked on it or I put in more effort to make them and myself look good. It doesn't help that I'm too quiet and so I don't argue. That's true. There's not really a point in me speaking up either because I feel like I won't be taken seriously so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The quietness is probably just a mix of my introversion and anxiety but I guess it's getting better so that's good. I agree, Dono. You don't know how badly I wished to be grouped with my other friends who actually cared, I am good friends with the people who were in my group but not all of them were good when it came to taking it seriously ykno @Greenberry I don't think there's a problem with being in that category, so long as you still do your part and don't throw work on others which you don't ^_^ Luckily, I have both I have a mix of people who are one or both in my friendship circles which I'm grateful for My favourite subjects are English and Performing Arts but I can do well in most subjects if I put my mind to it so there's versatility The only science I enjoy is Chemistry I haven't taken sociology, philosophy and psychology but I feel like they're up my alley Like I had to do a health assignment on gender stereotypes which sort of falls into the sociology aspect and I think I did a pretty damn good job I think about existence all the time but I try to do it in a positive light Like I'm happy with my existence because I know what I want to achieve and I feel like I've found my life's purpose already So all I need to do is pursue it and work towards it I want to live feeling accomplished and I can do that through my passions I already am, my friend Acting and writing as my career, I'm determined it'll happen It's better late than never. Many people don't find their passions for a long time, I'm just lucky I did at a young age... But it could always change for me I guess Wildlife conservation sounds very noble. And even if people don't value writing, you can pursue it on the side meanwhile doing something else. Thank you so much! I really appreciate that <3 I believe you can do that, Dono. It's a very brave step and you've definitely got the ambition, I hope you achieve your goal! @Greenberry Animation sounds really cool! I'm glad you figured it out, I've got respect for people who do design characters and write stories... There's so many different ways to do it too, animation sounds phenomenal though! Mate, don't put yourself down like that. You're 27, I'd say that's pretty young and Greenberry is right as well. You've come this far, embrace it. New Zealand is amazing from what I hear And everyone I know from there is extremely kind Sydney and QLD are great, I do need to travel there sometime. Stuck in Melbourne for the time being @Greenberry A course sounds great. And I get what you mean with stuff being exhausting, the end result is always the most satisfying though. @Dono In terms of weather, it's unpredictable. I think Melbourne isn't a bad city when it comes to the arts and literature though so if that's what you're looking for, it's good. There's a lot of sightseeing as well, I don't think I can say much more but it isn't bad ykno I'm lucky to live here though Although, I want to study abroad when I'm older maybe Acting opportunities aren't the best here so I do want to go to University in a place where I can find more auditions and stuff A self project sounds super intriguing, good luck on it! I'm actually trying to pursue screen acting since I like the style more but I have considered theatre, I've been getting into auditioning and filming self-tapes though and I've got my eye on a really good course I can do over the break I've been so caught up with assignments that I haven't been able to work on much of my own stuff but yeah, I did write something! I still haven't edited much though because b u s y. I could probably share the first paragraph with you though, it's vague but tells the story in a way. @Dono @Greenberry Theatre is definitely good with building confidence (and other stuff I'm too tired to get into) and I've been taking acting classes that are flexible but catered to confidence and stage acting for a while now and it's gotten to a point where I feel more connected to screen hence why I am planning on pursuing it soon. Theatre and screen are very different though and I have tons of respect for actors who work in one or both. I just realised how much I've been writing. Sorry, I've got a tendency to ramble, I'll try to keep it short from now on. That's definitely true. Conversation is just fun in general as well. As quiet as I am in real life, I talk way too much once you get to know me 😂 And now I gotta sleep, I need to wake up in like 4 hours 😬 I don't talk on vc as much as I write in the chat 😂 Goodnight/morning everyone Buh bye oh my god, i didn't do terribly in performing arts despite the unprepared group apparently my assessed work is 90-100% uH how tf @Greenberry Either way, I'll take it 😂 @Raven 3 That's understandable, it's not everyone's thing. I love it though 😍 Photographer? Who said I was a photographer? @Raven 3 Acting, music, dancing, any art form that requires performance  @Raven 3 Oooh, that's not something I wouldn't be interested in either tbh, film production and photography sounds right up my alley too Where are you from?  @Greenberry Ooo, I've read about the weather there, it can be extremely hot and cold, can't it? Egypt sounds amazing though! That's Autumn/Winter? It gets colder in Melbourne o; @oge what if it was a choices prom where you could take ivy MY CONFERENCE WENT SO GOOD WTF Thank youuu, I'm so relieved 😅 Thank you, Viv! So do you ❤ Thank you, Hilda! 💘💘💘 ugh i love you all, what did i do to deserve this 😂💟 @Raven 3 YAY GOOD JOB! and then i guess i should say de*server* rather than deserve I'm so confused and no one's replying to me One of my friends sent me a message saying they're depressed and I'm trying to reach out but they won't answer I just saw my other friend's comment on a post and apparently my other friend is in the hospital I hope they're both alright >< I think they are, I just talked to one of them  @oge Turns out the one in the hospital just hurt their knee and the other friend who messaged me was probably upset because she thought it was her fault I'm not sure, she won't reply but I think she'll be alright. I'm going to message her again in a bit I'm aware, she's alright, she's been reading my messages and I know why she sent the message @oge Oh, you meant considering suicide. She's not, she was just upset that something was her fault but it's been cleared up I believe. @BigHutchHO Woah, dude, you okay? Is this for your writing or else I'm concerned They've literally been overworking you to the point it's impacted your health, why are you getting fired? ^^ You'll get through this, Benji Even if you don't want to, you will. Give your dad some time and focus on new employment and yourself next. We all want you alive and here, Benji, so does Jon and your dad and everyone else. They'll be okay so long as you're still here You've come this far, you can go further But you'll find one that is, one where they're more understanding and appreciative of how hardworking and amazing you are Benji, please don't hurt yourself. There'll be a resolution eventually ~~Hi alive I'm Silver~~ ^^ Sorry x.x @Kezz haii Kezz c: Yeah I'm pretty behind too x.x Only caught up with AME I love writing Hmm? @oge LMFAO ARTS AND WRITING ARE WHAT IM GOOD AT oh, hilda hates me too in that case :( I just said I love writing lol ooh, dono, did you ever want to read some of that story i talked about before ;o What story? It was a dystopian story I was writing for school based off of an idea I had a couple years ago :p I wanna see! x.x @Raven 3 💘💘💘 what about Dono though! @Dono @Deleted User I'll dm you both a small part from it I need you to accept my friend request first, Silver ^_^ I was helping someone with an ES fanfic long ago in Feenie's server but that person went AWOL so uhh there's that @Deleted User I do? We share servers so you can DM me I was tryna make a group dm with Dono so it would be easier and I need to be friends with both of you to do that Oh ok But I can just send it to you guys separately If you'd rather that ^_^ Done All my friends are in relationships You're 26, Dono I'm 13 My friends are babs Well, this is probably the age people start dating tbh And I don't judge, I respect it AS I CAN OBSESS OVER MACK TO MAKE UP FOR IT 👏 People are hitting puberty around this time though And I have friends who are older and younger Anyway I remember dating being a big thing when I was like 10-11 as well Well, I guess I sort of hit it at 10 So yeah There were so many signs I was Bi that I brushed off, it's hilarious at this point How am I like Kaitlyn It's how I was raised I guess To be open-minded I can see where you're coming from, Dono It's hard to explain but I guess there is a good thing about it It's 4am What do I eat The concept of time I will devour it I'm tired IDK what IM saying and I'm too lazy to type properly No, I just fucked up my sleeping pattern recently And I've been staying up for VCs Because you guys are all more fun than sleep My connection is being wonky again so sorry if you guys don't see my messages We don't see your msgs Zee ;-; Obviously not Also that was a really dumb message for me to send @Dono Love ya too, I guess you're all like older siblings to me I'm basically your twin but 13 years older I quote Viv, "our 13 year old" 😂 If that makes sense It makes sense! Hello "twin" :p Haii c: It's almost 5am My sleeping pattern is amazing Mhm At least it's not school for you so you're fine I guess Once school's back on though 💀 I'll have a play to be rehearsing for and exams + assessments I need to get it together soon That is inequality What the hell Is that a lot or a little? That seems good Around 54,000 annual salary hmm It's okay I guess I don't do USD I do AUD Lemme convert Ooh Oh, that's only like $4,136.52 annually then You can just use ub3r lol That isn't a lot At least not here The real estate here is getting real expensive apparently, at least in my area Yeah, that's terrible I would and I'm a female I'd rather not get paid more for working less just because of my gender That's bad damn Well realistically speaking, I rather would tbh, but would feel bad for my coworkers I'd rather it be equal Because I feel like it's obviously extremely unfair to the males and it also implies that I wouldn't be able to work more hours and get paid properly? Yeah I'd rather it be equal too, but I won't reject the job if I think it's paying me right just because of it I understand what you mean, Silver I think it would also depend on the job and the performance of the worker. I just dislike how it's based on gender though. Yeah I'd dislike that too I don't mind being paid more if it's based on my performance or something But I'm also still young and haven't worked an actual job so I guess I have a lot to learn before deciding anything in that regard I'm also falling asleep so sorry if I don't make any sense 😦 Yeah Yeah, my eyes feel very dry and I'm pretty much falling asleep at this point I sometimes stay up late and sometimes don't depending on how tired I am lol Work is hard sometimes but sometimes it's not much So just depends on how work is going on that particular day Your job seems hard, props to you tbh And I now need my 😴, goodnight to you all! It can be a pain in the you know what lol Night! c: Gn! :) And yeah but the medical field is a pretty noble field in the end, you are helping people a ton Sleeeeep lol Oki ^^ said what I couldn't put into words because I'm a sleepy fuck okay night imma go fr gn! ^_^ ;o were you just waiting for Zee to leave, Doge? Because you mean x.x x.x ;o Baii c: We'll have Hilda become our doggo again @Greenberry what crush video, my dude? One of those "satisfying videoes" on youtube perhaps :GWchinaSakuraThinking: -.- perhaps @oge why'd you @ me, friendo Oh, they made Minecraft Story Mode? My younger sister plays that ooo Have you watched the show? With what money 👀 Doge is a criminal?! 🙀🙀🙀 How do I know you two aren't working together and you only blame him to cover for yourself? 🤔   @oge Maybe you work from home as a criminal? How would you know that? Because you probably gave him the tip to hide in Cyprus And you could be hiding that you're a good hacker or something 9K4 is just the exterior, you're the brains of the projects! Maybe you're just saying that so I don't figure out the truth 😤 I'm just joking around 😂 @oge 🙀😼 At least I don't almost ping everyone hMm @oge What do you have to say for yourself? @Dono So... Doge? Darling, that's not my typing style. Nope, that's not me :p I didn't, it's clearly your typing style. I have decent grammar though. Not that your grammar is bad but if I were to genuinely insult someone, I'd make sure I was doing it with proper grammar. I know, I'm kidding around bro Your English doesn't suck  @oge I didn't 👀 @oge Your English is actually quite good, don't put yourself down like that. It's better than some of my classmates who have English as their first language in all honesty. And I'm sure if I tried to write in Bulgarian, I'd fail completely. I didn't mean it in a rude sense, I apologise. No, I was being ignorant and it was wrong of me to say that It is good, trust me That's only because it's my first language Just like how your Bulgarian would be better than mine Yes and we mainly speak English in Australia 😂  @oge What language do you think we speak?? Australian? Ooo, hello mate, I saw a kanga, throw some shrimps on the barbie Yeah but we mainly speak English It's an Aussie accent! Though, mine's not very strong or bogan. A lot of people come off as more "British". Which may be because the British did colonise Australia. I SAW THAT DOGE O: Why do people think I'm British and like 16-22 years old 😦 No but still, I don't know how 😂 I asked my friend and he said it's because I'm "mature"? Doge giving a compliment? 🙀 😂😂 Well, thank you! You're very smart too :D Why can't you be both? Aww, have fun with whatever is better than discord  @oge Change your name to "Ding Vegetables" then I don't know how to ride a bike either? I also don't know how to swim 😬 Never learnt ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I used to get sick every time I went to a swimming lesson so I had to stop I think Dono meant drive? But I could be wrong I'm not old enough to drive :GWfroggyPepoThumb: What is a hot pocket? I don't think I've ever had one :GWfroggyBlobThonk: They don't look too appealing And I can't eat pepperoni so O O F :GWomoRaphiOhMy: No, it's good Isn't there pork in it?  @Dono As an Italian, can confirm. In fact I don't think any pepperoni I've ever eaten was pork. Can be wrong tho :GWworkshopAkaShrug: The closest I've been to eating pork is eating jellybeans with pork gelatine According to Google it's usually got pork but I guess it isn't? I should try the other kinds one day then! @Dono Indeed Very much so ^_^ I'm pretty sure I've told you on VC before, Dono? I'm sure she did I remember telling someone 🤔 She can be a foreigner living in Austrailia thi but uhh yeah Australian but my parents are from South-Asia I see Indian, then? Bangladeshi I see ***m a g i c*** My parents came here in 2003 I was born in 2004 Come to Italy I'll give you all a free tour Some of my friends are actually on a study trip in Italy right now! ;o And I learn Italian at school! That's cool, I only like certain kinds of pizza ;O I'm offended Hilda! HIII HOW ARE YOU FEELING Aww :/ Get well soon, make sure to take care and rest! Take any medicine if you need to, stay warm If there was a Choices Convention, would you guys go? Like ran by Pixelberry and stuff @oge Your PC has friends that it brought over or what? Oh no. What's happened?  @Raven 3 @oge Ooh, Happy Birthday to your father! @Raven 3 Not at all We shouldn't discriminate anyone for their race or anything for that matter @Raven 3 That's ridiculous, coming from a fellow POC. Mateeee Choosing a white LI doesn't make anyone racist? You really aren't from what I know  @Raven 3 Uhh, so many of them Probably AME because wifey @Raven 3 I just followed your tumblr 💓 There's toxicity in every community unfortunately I hope nothing happens here Everyone seems to be fine so far You are brilliant and so is everyone else on this server Go eat some pudding Live your best life Caramel? I've tried some before, it was quite good Oh no... Have I started pudding discourse? 😭 Forgive me for I have sinned 😔 It might just be anxiety, Dono Happens to me all the time And Hilda. I really hate when people think we can't have valid opinions because of our age. I understand how people might think that we're young and still have a lot to learn but that doesn't mean I don't know anything and am not capable of forming an educated opinion. Like, if you don't agree with something I say then educate me politely or debate with me politely and don't belittle me because of my age?  @Raven 3 ^^ I'd also rather be informed politely on what someone doesn't agree with me on rather than told that I'm young and my opinions are insignificant You have not, do tell though? What server is that What in the world? I see 😐 I eliminated Bianca, am I sexist? Jeez I just realised I'm following them 😦 You are a minor yourself though? I don't see you joking anywhere in the discord receipts Didn't you apologise and explain what you meant? :GWfroggyMonkaThink: I feel like it was a misinterpreted message that got blown out of proportion And they took it too far You apologised, you explained, you did all you could tbh What even I don't think it's sexist to dislike Bianca Tumblr is one of the most cancerous places idk why people even bother I, a female, am now sexist to females for disliking a character I'm speechless sheesh My faith in humanity was 0 to begin with so don't think it can go more down It's an interactive story game for goodness' sake I mean I knew cancerous people like that existed lol HM ?! This makes me iffy about being apart of the fandom, esp the tumblr aspect If I don't like a female character am I sexist too? ;o @Raven 3 You, a male, chose male LIs. That's pretty heterosexual, damn But...but...I even prefer girls x.x So I prefer girls, am a girl myself, but hate my own gender. Wow I must be bad at hating x.x @oge I uhhh...may or may not have picked white Mack ;o I chose white Mack and white Adrian x.x I chose white Mack and Latino Adam I must hate black people then damn These people confuse me as much as Ryder's confusion during his elimination So, you apologised and some of them still nitpick every thing you do? That's low :GWliliumFacepalmSeola: To be honest, I've read so many different things, I'd want to be more informed before forming an opinion on that? But I don't condone discriminating someone because they're white. Agreed wholeheartedly ^^ @Raven 3 Oh god welp :GWfroggyMonkaThink: NSNDDN WHAT MATE IM MY GODD im going to go sleep because it's almost 7am but damn more like goodmorning 😬😂 but ye, gn/gm to you all and enjoy the rest of your day or night or whatever! https://www.instagram.com/p/BoAwufkAWvk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=10evl2g0o1cdv @BigHutchHO IM DONE, PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO IM D O N E LMAO DOGE You watched brilliance Johnny Johnny None of you can appreciate true art smh @Raven 3 Are you able to take it to a shelter or adopt it?

Thx c: I'm pretty good, my headache seems to have gone ^_^ A writer from Pixelberry posted something with #telltalejobs or something iirc Let's hope for some ppl fron telltale joining PB :caticon: Then our choices will have at least *some* affect :dva: @Raven 3 LMFAO WHAT IS THAT why would they even- it makes him look more south-asian or something though he looks like he could be my cousin lmao he does OMG GREENBERRY I SAW THAT DJDJFJDJDNDJDJ :GWfroggyPoggers: :GWfroggyPoggers: :GWfroggyPoggers: @Raven 3 LETS PRITIED HIM UP! :D ooo @Greenberry You can do it! YESSS GREENBERRY CONGRATS! YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A BRILLIANT ANIMATOR AND YOU'VE GOT A BRIGHT FUTURE AHEAD OF YOU! Thank you! I hope so ^_^ Isn't Greenberry older than you, Hilda 😹 https://www.16personalities.com It's a personality test It can tell you your level of introversion and extroversion and the results can be quite accurate speaking from experience You should, it's quite fun as well I'm the same! 🤛 shakespeare was an infp there's this really cool video edit made by an INFP it's so good NFPs are the coolest 😤 Ooo, ENFPs are really cool I was raised by one so can confirm 100% The superstars Most of this, if not all is true for me Agreed Just like astrology isn't really a science but it's still fun I think if someone studies astrology properly then there is potential for accuracy Because most people judge it based on the superficial horoscopes and humorous posts they see But it's really a lot more than that I think I'm a Monkey? 🐵 Also, apparently there's such a thing as blood type horoscopes 😳 I don't know my blood type 😬 I probably should I don't think there's a specific kind for me I just listen to whatever sounds good to me I'll have to check my playlists real quick, give me a min Dono is an INFP-A, we're INFP-Ts But nice! And INFPs are totally special Dodie Clark, Zella Day, The Neighbourhood, Julian Moon, Panic! At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, Shakira, Rihanna, Ariana Grande... Those are a few artists who I've listened to more than one song of but they aren't all I listen to A = Assertive
T = Turbulent DODIE IS AMAZING I need to listen to her new song I don't think so, I need to listen to more of her stuff But her P!ATD covers and God Is A Woman Cover 😍😍 I love "In The Middle" and "You" tbh And that song she made for Pride Month with the skittles Ooh, link our favourite songs? There's one I found recently but the cover image is titties So let me see if I can find a lyric video or smth bcoz titty good https://youtu.be/YoAhQT6GotA https://youtu.be/5qKIocrRnkU The two songs I've gotten into lately https://youtu.be/INtvBqRkuYw @Greenberry this work? Ooh, oj ok* Spotify? alright I'll listen also what the hell, I just saw a clip of dora the explorer grown up she's at a strip show what https://www.instagram.com/p/BoJ6_Txn4aH/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=2ysawh36xudl WHAT IS THIS dora the explwhorer
- i'm kidding, i don't slut-shame same and I think you can make a spotify playlist on a free acc like make a new one i love early 2000s music oh my gosh @Greenberry stay hydrated boo and you could make it about a specific story or character? like songs that suit them omg yes or just choices doms ykno ooh, true she's got a lot of anger @azula what's your favourite early 2000s song girlfriend is iconic didn't she release new music in the last two years @azula yesss @Dono wait what She has Lyme Disease if that's what you're referring to? link? @Dono Maybe they're not as hyped up or marketed? She got diagnosed in 2015 I think And let me aee see @azula make collaborative? let me check on my acc where my dad hasn't renewed my premium i've stolen his for the time being lol oh, i think so? yuck and alright so songs that Mackenzie would listen to or songs that remind me of Mackenzie? i got a question above ^^ all I can think of are badassy songs honestly oh, storytime you know how if you use spotify on multiple devices, you can see what's being listened to on another device? yeah so i used to use my dad's account and i think i cut off his music while he was in the car and i was listening to a song at home and when he came home, he confronted me because in the car, he was greeted by a song called "go fuck yourself" on his played :) i didn't get in trouble but he was like "what do you even listen to" it's a good song though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ for mack? ooo WAIT MACKENZIE LIKES TO SALSA SO WOULDN'T THERE BE SMTH OF THAT NATURE omg estelle sang that one woman army by porcelain black? OH HOW I JOIN A CALL AND I HEAR "- invented BDSM" WHAT i don't know what's happenin ye hold up the full thing? that's the whole one i also have and there's the full one cut take your pick yesss I should probably make a reddit, I just anonymously stalk everything there and I added Oh No! to the playlist because it reminds me of how Mackenzie is during AME? like "don't do love, don't do friends, I'm only after success" is a lyric in the song, ykno hell yeah tumblr? or nah i've only got like 60 followers but i can share it under the ame tags and mackenzie tags if you want guys, who are your celebrity crushes? ;o Hmmmmm No idea lol mila kunis is stunningggg Mila Kunis is ok Not a big fan of her I remember when I was younger I had a huge crush on Beckham :GWowoHehe: Bend It Like Beckham None can bend like Beckham Ok a few can probably can but uhh yeah Dave and Amanda are beautiful Bebe Rexha <3 @azula I looked her up and she's gorgeous! She's been in films that are my language o; Bebe Rexha is sooooo pRetty I love Phoebe Tonkin she's honestly so stunning and Mädchen Amick, Amy Jackson, Aishwarya Rai Eyal Booker, Chace Crawford and Ben Barnes are absolute babes goddesses what the fuck LMFAO I JUST POSTED A SELFIE ON IG AND SOMEONE COMMENTED THAT I LOOK LIKE AN EPISODE CHARACTER bye guys, i'm going to the episode fandom where i truly belong 😤 @Dono He's pretty. I feel like I've seen him somewhere or he resembles another actor I might know? I just looked up the other actor and realised I should probably be wearing my glasses because I think I was wrong about the resemblance I was thinking of Nicholas Gonzalez but they look nothing alike, forgive my stupidity lmao He's played so many roles in so many shows I've watched hehehehe i was joking 😦 ily guys sorry don't worry, i won't D: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9j5svr/bo_burnhams_eight_grade_to_receive_worldwide/?utm_source=reddit-android Yaaaaaay I hope it releases near me too x.x wtf That's so sexist What if there are nonbinary people They can just yeet outta the class like "yeah, can't do crunches or push-ups ¯\_(ツ)_/¯" Ugh Doge the fit E-God I thought you had class today, Viv? I had to replay a chapter of AME twice yesterday because I was so tired I kept messing up I'm in this weird state of mind like... I can't describe it but I'm exhausted mentally but also not It's weird Yeaaah, maybe I'll take a break Yeah def take a break I think I've been spending too much time on discord It'd be best to take a break for a while so I can focus on myself That's a good idea, actually When I feel pretty mentally tired I take little breaks from all social media ~~little as in few weeks~~ Yeah, social media can be really draining Yeah @9k4 It's more about me overexerting myself and trying to help anyone and everyone, I stop focusing on myself and my mental state can go awry without me realising it myself. But I definitely agree with what you said. Thanks guys. I think I'm still going to come on, there's no specific guideline I've set to this so-called break. I'm just going to limit my use of discord though. Or just use it to discuss the game and that's it tbh ~~start by not using it til 5 am~~ ~~noted~~ Gonna miss you Zee :c Take care! Thank you 💓 @oge 💘 And, some are ridiculously expensive although I've found decent ones for like $2 Nooo, I'm hopefully not dying anytime soon I'm just taking a slight break or just limiting my use of discord as I need some time to focus on my health and getting my stuff together Damn Wtf That's good ugh they sound like idiots don't say that, there's still a great community there are organisations that support the lgbtqpa+ and there are allies who support us unfortunately but it's getting better india just decriminalised gay sex i think i mean, some people mistake lesbians for good friends lmfao i'm not sure about all that considering i don't know many lgbt people my age irl well, they end up being like "oh, what a nice *friendship*" rather than acknowledging that it's a romantic relationship which, some girls are really affectionate so i understand but some people will see two girls kissing and be like "AWW, YOU GUYS ARE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS!" yeah, i dislike that that's one of the most ridiculous societal standards. we're all human and we should be able to healthily express our emotions regardless of gender and not be shamed for it :/ society perpetuates some toxic stereotypes and all that, yeah not every human is toxic it's just the ideas that have been ingrained into our brains Eating seafood is a sin? TIL exactly and it's also not someone's business to decide who another person is in a relationship with and whatnot it's really not bothering anyone Yeah this is the first I've heard of it And my mother is pretty religious lol i mean homosexuality is a sin in my religion i think? but i'm still gonna be a :GAY: :Thot: someone call the dogtor, this dog got more bone than needed I didn't really train to be a vet sowwy x.x same You mean to ask me what do I do in my everyday life? Sleep, job, etc etc 😢 @Kezz haiiii kezz c: I'm late x.x But long time no see Decent but keen for plans I have tomorrow, you? I'm going out to a shopping centre and just chilling with my friends ^_^ Better than staying inside for my whole break I hope so! You look great! What's the thing you guys are drinking at around 6:00? Ooh, nice! Lina's favourite :GWfroggyPepoThumb: Sounds fun tbh I don't even know if we have proms here We might in our final year I guess? A lot of schools have a sixth grade graduation here 😂 I didn't have one since mine operates differently but a few of my friends friends had their's and went in a limo for it I think Hey, the year just started, I know it's rough right now but I'm sure it'll get better somewhere through. You could always just go for the experience, volunteer to help and then you can enjoy it while still having something to do. And, you don't need a date to enjoy prom if that's what you're referring to. In the end, it's your choice but I hope you do whatever you think is best for you!  @Raven 3 Lots of people go to prom without dates from what I know And if it's in three years then you have a lot of time @Raven 3 I know tons of people who aren't as social and still managed to find some friends later on. And for me, I used to be extremely anxious and not very social but I stepped out of my comfort zone and approached someone myself in my first year of secondary, I had never done it before and now they're one of my best friends! You've got three years and six months and I'm sure you can find some cool people in that timespan. Sometimes you just gotta say "fuck it" and do something without overthinking it It seriously helps But like don't go light someone's house on fire or anything, I meant like little things out of your comfort zone Like a new activity or approaching someone As Doge would say if he were here rn, "not like 9K4" Neither is mine to be honest... Hence why I'm not out to any of my friends at school as a bi girl. I mean, we have posters supporting the LGBT and whatnot But the posters don't prevent people from being toxic Many are supportive though I guess but there's a fair amount who aren't from what it seems That's annoying honestly That sucks but I sorta know how it feels. Just remember that there's nothing wrong with your sexuality, it's completely normal and valid! It's so stupid like just because someone is homosexual doesn't mean they'll go and hit on every person of the same gender With that logic I'm hitting on every single guy and girl I see But that's a cricket bat Birthday twin! Haii c: @Raven 3 More like gay guy: *breathes*
Hetero guy: U CONTAMINATED MY AIR WITH THE HOMOSEXUALITY We do c: Indeed we do The 14th of November! Except I'm exactly half of Silver's age right now Yeah lol I think that's my uncle's birthday, Hilda Zee and her family share birthdays with everyone born in november :GWowoHehe: It's close to Benji's I think!  @Raven 3 ;o It's soon! One of my classmates also has 4th of October I believe @Raven 3 Your one toooo @Greenberry Good luck with adulthood People consider sixteenth birthdays to be special in some places It's like a coming of age thing ~~it's also a coming out age~~ :caticon: :GWfroggyPoggers: There was a period of time where I wanted to name my future daughter May-elle but then I realised it would sound like "Male/Mail" Lol Zee @Raven 3 We can celebrate it on the server! You could have articles for you *See how this brave mother breaks gender stereotypes by naming her daughter Male!* @Deleted User LMAOO Oh well. I gotta go now. Take care everyone! c: If it were up to me, I'd do that too but my choice of snack would probably be Mack :GWuraOchakoPeace: Take care, Silver! 😹 😹 I pray that he's alright Oh, thank goodness I went out today and it was hella fun my friends and I played this dance game and we accidentally clicked "yes" for the game to take a photo of us and it automatically went up on their website so that's nice my feet also hurt like hell It was! A little boy, maybe 3-4 years old, was blowing kisses at us 😂 He was so adorable 😊 And this other kid was hella rude but it was low-key amusing I'm dying @Deleted User are you ok don't die @oge LMAO, for real? @Deleted User I'm at work and got a cold and runny nose which is resulting in a headache x.x Oh no, are you able to end early or something? Take medicine and rest when possible!  @Deleted User Our wood tech teacher makes the people stand in front of everyone for a while and then asks them their reason for being late before telling them off Pretty basic once this kid came into the classroom literally like two seconds before my friend and i and apparently he was on time but we weren't..? @Deleted User IDK. I can but I don't wanna since I skipped a few days already because of my foot x.x
But I did take medicine and am feeling better now Sorry for late reply. Was busy @Tyr Hey, you alright? @Tyr DM me if you need to talk about it Okay, please don't hesitate to message me if you need anything. Take care, Furion.  @Tyr Anytime 💞 Haii c: Husband?! ;o What...the hell happened while I was gone :GWfroggyMonkaThink: bad husband Oh, I have classmates who do that in class By coke, do you mean Coca Cola or Cocaine? okay good, don't do drugs 😡 unless they're for medical purposes Same @azula viv, be apart of the family no @azula go on #robo-lab-bots ;o Only a thot would say that! x.x :GWowoHehe: HAHA SILVER Why is life so busy I wish I was like 10 again smh they are gai out as gay RIP It's dumb only if she has a SO Ouch...that really is kinda dumb Unless you left like a letter or somethibg with it too If it's only the flowers then ehh Italy 🇮🇹 👍 Thx c: I love Bo Burnham @9k4 fix this x.x Why not You have admin so you can ... You can but you don't know how to I can help, then It's not about the command You have to change the API key and that other thing Wait lemme open it so I can guide you properly Oh ok @ me when you return Putting instructions like that won't work it's better to go step by step ES has only 2 books.

Join the weeb side Cheesus Viv He shouldn't. It's PG 16 Is this loss DISCORD COUNTRY DOES STARTING NOW Idk what happened, and I'm too lazy to read, but being an admin doesn't justify rule breaking. If Mods and Admins themselves can't follow rules, they can't expect regular members to do so too.
That aside, idk if Benji actually broke rules or not. Am just saiyan I kinda get where Kezz is coming from since brother stuff is considered personal but welp Yes YES IT'S THE CUTEST THING IN THE WORLD TCATF RP may be completed soon. I have also planned Elementalists, Hero and ATV RPs for future projects :GWtogaSataniaDead: :GWnanamiKurisuSip: All books are connected one way or another Theory: all the books are a part of a game called Choices, which is completely fictional *expelliarmus* You sound like a killer threatening people Who is this Natasha I saw that No I'm referring to Benjo Oh ye I'll delete it then Viv did already nvm :GWlulurdMmmYea: :caticon: Announcement out :caticon: I know That's why I mentioned it I already have some people in mind who I'll invite I have more in mind @Altair is nice too >Benji thinking Viv is allowed to make only meme characters It doesn't, Zee Wait I meant Comedic/light hearted characters are fine But not just pure shitposting RP/character Ye I know some who will be fine in the RP, and some who can be fine if they try, and some who can become fine after some tips and stuff Who Uhh I mean I've mentioned my criteria and stuff. If they can follow them then I don't see why not c: Hol up y'all 1. Just because a game has no story doesn't mean it's bad.
2. Ninja harassing someone in game makes him bad, not the game.
3. Ninja sucks indeed
4. Just because the fandom is cancerous, doesn't mean the game is better. For reference: look at a lot of Choices' tumblr fandom A game being good or bad is subjective. Depends on the person's taste. All that makes them bad not Fortnite but ok Lmao Stay away from my daughter who is my server mom, y'all x.x Kek Kekxa doesn't know what a kek is Kek Lmao I can kidnap her too BUT I WON'T I'll be the one to drive the car duhh Rules of Engagement Gotta fill in for 9k when he isn't here Like *cool* Lexa go away GB approached him first you should book an appointment for later ;o My heart is broken x.x I'll just Go Time to leave the server ~~I'll rejoin after a minute dw~~ Spotify support for mobile is here yay :GWnanaPepoHype: That's racist Why white shoes only Smh >white walls

I don't think I'll be able to live upto expectations with the RP, keeping in mind all the effort you all put into it I meant they are good you dummy I don't think I can live upto the expectations, but I will give it my all to do so Well, I meant try to do so :caticon: Hi zee c: I'm kinda busy rn sowwy x.x Also:

I think a lot of content on it is kinda cringy? Idk. I'll see Lmao I watched til Diamond Skipped Unova Watched a little Kalos Then finally dropped it Oooh I thought it was my shite net @Weiss hey weeb Is Kaguya anime 1 cour or 2 Damn. Stay safe Furi :caticon: :GWfateeSip: I have played Episode few times. Most books were shite but Emerald was good Good thing about Episode is users can create stories Worst thing about Episode, is also the fact that users can create stories It's a pretty good thing in theory, but the stories most users make are cancerous If they would self approve books first, that would be nice I liked Emerald which was a featured one The writer pulled all her work from Episode last I checked Either pulled it all or stopped uploading more Because of books like teen pregnancy and shit where Episode won't bat an eye about it, and teen sex and stuff sometimes while the game was rated uhh PEGI 12 or something She told them to change rating and remove books and stuff and things went down, but then she told them she won't cause a ruckus and go away quietly and then they didn't do anything about it again Lol Unfortunately not Well I played something called White Island or something It seemed intriguing But then I dropped it Well visual novel game doesn't necessarily mean the type episode or choices etc make I mean if I had to rate Choices books I would call half of em meh too but I get your point Good mobile games are usually hard to find My personal favourite game that you can have fun with, without paying a penny, is Swordigo I don't if it turns out like Episode I'd rather they do a competition, and collect the winner script, and make it into a story themselves, than let users make whole books themselves Well Benji If that's the worst you can remember Episode having, you are in the safe zone Kek @Weiss not PB writing it themselves Whole story written by a user, which PB just animate Less than 24 hours remaining for Elementalists, so I'll move it to on going. Brb @Weiss yesss Have you played Choices of Rebels or The Great Tournament? Masterpieces Choices of Rebels has only 1 or so chalter free but you can find a crack somewhere Great Tournament is free Magium is also nice but the problem is the wait for chapters, as it's ongoing. One chapter takes like uhh 2 months to come out Ye Worth it, usually I haven't played in a long time Since book 2 ended. It's on book 3 chapter 3 rn Lol Great tournament is pretty good I haven't played 2nd part of it But I should soon If you want story and not just pics and romance or sex stuff, then the stuff Anhi and I mentioned is pretty good There is ofc, but their stories are pretty good Choice of Rebels was pretty fun but then I deleted it because I was so occupied in real life stuff Sci-fi RPs are my jam I can whip up a half decent Sci fi RP in about 10 mins. But I'm shit at other genres :GWcorbinTopKek: Yeah And lol Anhi It's the opposite for me I can make story But I get stuck at worldbuilding I spend too much time at world building and then my head begins to ache and I quit whatever I was working on Kek Funny thing, ATLA has one of the best Worldbuilding in any show, and it was mostly improvised They didn't spend much time on it and randomly did stuff in the last few days of writing Yeah Lol Well tbf it's the world not plot but ye Lmao LoK wasn't that good but it doesn't deserve the shit that people give it constantly Yeah It wasn't that good but good enough ~~and Korra bicon~~ I can't believe it first started airing when I was like uhhh 20 I think? Ye. April 14 2012 Yeah Yeah Lol :GWlulurdMmmYea: Lol Lol ~~I need more weeb songs on my phone~~ Wait That's her?

The rest...is upto you guys to figure out Oh *yes* - probably what she would say in this situation :GWcorbinTopKek: Only degenerates pick Half elf and Variant Human don't @ me I have to agree with Anhi tho :caticon: If you pick Variant Human you are a degenerate with no taste. It is known Not when they've been ruined by kinky friends And ofc V Humans are better but if you pick them you're a pleb V. Human is like a cheat code :aPout: Rogue best class :caticon: DID I STUTTER :GWcorbinTopKek: *Nat 20* DM: surprisedpikachu.png :bigmood: :GWcorbinTopKek: ~~Zamasu turn on the godtube~~ DnD with tomatoes helped me understand stats more than handbook or other stuff :caticon: "Ohhh so DnD is about tomatoes?"

If you have any younger family member that you love, whether it be younger sister, a nephew/niece or whatever, you HAVE to watch it Y u p Oh no indeed That damned ending put me in a depressive episode for like a week and I'm not even exaggerating Spoiler Alert
||The death itself wasn't that sad to me, although I did cry a bit. But when he burns the body.....I fucking lost myself|| Yeah World War 2 Also it's actually based on a true story Thankfully I didn't know that when I watched it If I did I wouldn't be able to help myself Idk really I don't want to know https://media.tenor.com/images/ce683800255ed8f5d45cf1e1f594e26a/tenor.gif :KatoriCry: Fucking Ghibli. Always making me cry Lexa have you watched Grave of the fireflies Arrietty is also pretty underrated Wait a fucking minute Just googled Arrietty Scrolled down *Cast: Tom Holland* Say what? He voiced Sho in the British dub of it https://youtu.be/SwhgmBNhAW0 It's a nice movie Anime and movies that have made me cry the most
Grave of the fireflies > Coco > Your Lie In April I also cried at the end of Promised Neverland dndidnej I'm too emotional Kubo did make me cry but not that much WAIT FUCK How can I forget The Parasol episode Of Violet Evergarden That scene ALWAYS gives me chills It's so damn good @Altair watch VE if you haven't Every episode of it will make you cry too But that damned Parasol scene I actually have that as my keyboard background lol https://youtu.be/LaokHCLggB4 The animation in this The damned animation God bless KyoAni Yes? I don't even mind because that scene is just Beautiful IT IS BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER WANTED TO CROSS THE LAKE TOO BUT DIED He is a writer Who writes stories and plays for kids But after his daughter died he kinda lost motivation Violet, the MC, is a type doll or whatever. And he hires her to type the stories he narrates It's a long ass story just watch the anime Lol Seriously tho if you've never watched Violet Evergarden Then drop everything you're doing And get to it right now Like right fucking now Do it wimp :Meganemaru: ~~sorry~~ You can sue me. I won't mind if it's for Violet Evergarden Even @Lexa can vouch for Violet Evergarden and she isn't into anime at all It's Netflix based in the first place Lol KyoAni made it with Netflix It's animation is the best I've ever seen really I have to go now. Ciao peeps c: Watch Carole and Tuesday It's also Netflix anime, made by Bones for their 10th anniversary :Pirate: .yt Carole and Tuesday loneliest girl Imagine watching Isekai If we die and our souls go to heaven or hell, are we getting Isekai'd into them Lmao Death Note is a good gateway anime. It's good af in the beginning to hook you in but it's ending is kinda shite so it doesn't outshine other shows Ez One Piece anime bad I did start the mango tho I read 44 chapters Then put it on hold Ha >800 :HowCute: It's in 930s Actually latest is 942 yeet I really enjoyed Kaguya anime, but when I found out it covered 42 or something chapters in 12 episodes I went into cardiac arrest Better than Tokyo Ghoul's 66 in 12 The promised land ***The Promised Neverland*** Anhi read TPN Lmao Watch Kimetsu Only if it's for the fact that LiSA did the OP and ED Imagine watching BC Manga is 10x better You gonna read Kishimoto's new manga? Oh also have you read/watched Bakuman It's amazing Lmao It's really, really good We Never Learn is on my list 5 cm per second be like :aPout: Watch Shokugeki The manga got shite in last 2 arcs but otherwise it's pretty good Lmao Reee https://youtu.be/pmanD_s7G3U Here The animation is on point Because welp Ufotable That's what a normie would say Mhm Normie ≠ bad tho Because FMAB got a live action And FMAB is a masterpiece :roseisangry: Enough spam for today Smh *mutual servers*

Smh Hi dead I'm Silver Don't melt me wtf Max Tennison 13:53 My summer started when I quit my job That's a long break doge Ah yes, the Queen Prince Charles has exceeded the retirement age in UK but he still never did the job he was born to do lol RIP @zebreano fun fact, Prince Charles also shares birthdays with us James Charles "explanation" video was actually pretty mature, tbh He handled it well for a 19 year old as compared to the others involved who were like in their 30s What things Probably. But James Charles' explanation vid seemed more "honest" to me, idk. Tita or whatever seemed like she wanted to kill his career and it was more about her brand than the allegations made against him What was her name lol Tati? Mhm Yeah Idc about him at all really, but he handled it well for a 19 year old. He's still young and immature, so I was more disappointed in the fact that someone in their 30s behaved the way she did rather than James Charles being a stupid teenager But oh welp I don't really watch any youtubers at all so meh Lol Why is EA not there Why is Rockstar there GTA series and Red Dead are quality Still, prior to Red Dead 2 there's still GTA. GTA was like everywhere People make controversies out of like nothing, but tbf IDK what controversy or what context so I can't really say ~~Put Pixelberry there~~ I have Borderlands 2 lying around on my PS3. Never played it much, tbh >Sega

Honestly might be the best anime ever. That's the general consensus at least. I like HxH more but I watched FMAB like years ago and don't remember much and even then it's a close 2nd. Might have to rewatch it soon My head hurts I'll get 9 I usually find internet tests pointless but I'll do one just for formality's sake lol 37 Just 10 years off.

I didn't know this server existed and made my own choices server. dumb me! there are like 3 people in my server who haven't used discord before and remain mostly offline thanks! I support both of you. does that count? i need to catch up on all the acronyms that you use oh! thanks! looks like @zebreano comes here once in a blue moon. or even rarer. this server dates back to 2018? who made it tho? aah! nice! I have been playing since 17th jan 2018 but discovered fandom like 3 months ago and discovered this server today! wow! I think red carpet diaries was updating when I was playing it took me a year to catch up on all the books how do you check? yeah. I still can't believe tc&tf was the last book I caught up on. I thought it would be boring but it was really good TF was the first book I played I think we only got two options to begin with yeah young adult, vampire and romance iirc romance is now trr instead of tf wait, ame got a 2.0? I don't like the 3rd book tbh. No relation score and drama is too boring on tis one yes anyways, it was nice meeting y'all. good night! Okay but this is Low-key a mood MC is talking abt eating in a theater
The story is where MC pretty much owns a movie theater pretty sure lol Fictif could potentially be even more competition for Choices tbh
I mainly think that bc it's made by the same ppl who made the arcana, and the artstyle and the characters are just 👌👌 I don't mind not seeing MCs tbh 
But that's just me 
And I loved the arcana bc the story was good and the characters were👌 I honestly didn't feel that way at all tbh? good morning! He is 10 years old so my mom only allows him to play for 2 hours yes its the distributing flyers mission he is terrible in airplane driving He is completing asset missions to get the last mission - keep your friends close yeah. it took him 4 days to do that yeah! he was never able to do that when he was 6 years old He did the printing press mission iirc Only asset missions left for him are boatyard and film studio he is having a hard time with it he is terrible at boat driving too misses some checkpoints then goes out of time He picked up VC after 4 years Why do gamers type F when consoling? Is that a PC game too? Oh! Only game I hear is PUBG Me and my brother are sick of hearing about it lol My cousins like playing games and introduce us to new games whenever we go to their place. This time they were all PUBG PUBG They introduced us to IGI, GTA, pokemon, jetpack joyride, temple run, subway surfers etc I used to play it more in 2014 now, I play pokemon and choices and occasional candy crush pokemon go and pokemon games on emulators of course Idk what type of games I even like I play tentrix on browser whenever I have spare time are you fine with 40C summers? @oge oh! here winters get upto 5C and summers get upto 45-47C So I like neither of the extreme seasons OOF! that's so cold Does it snow? I have never seen snow irl But good news is I am moving to a city where minimum temp goes to 16C and max goes to 35C So, climate there is pretty nice It must be pretty chilly hehe! My hands started paining when I washed my hands until a week ago Now, its starting to get warm My mom gives me a special drink every night that prevents from catching cold So, I have not had cold since last two years But you are not supposed to eat or drink anything after that drink for a few hours for complete effect Get well soon! Now, my nose only starts running when I eat something spicy Thats really good! uh-huh My mom makes the drink I mentioned at home with some sort of dry fruits and milk afaik Natural remedies Good to know! Oh! hmm... never heard of sambucus Yeah! My mom's special drink doesn't have a nice taste either All healthy things taste bad imo yeah! stay safe and healthy! That's not gonna happen. Trust me. You'll be fine Why did they go with the female MC cover when male MC cover was so good?🤔 Ngl
Slow burn romance would be nice
Here's to hope thats what DS is gonna be like I'm a sucker for the prick LI who turns out to be a nerd and a sweetheart deep down in the end tho Jackie was so bleh lmao

Good Morning and happy valentine's day!! ❤️ My fav holiday is holika dahan because that's when I was born yeah! another Indian festival to commemorate win of good over evil There is a nice story behind why we celebrate holika dahan I also like Diwali because *fireworks* yes, its to celebrate the homecoming of lord rama after defeating ravana Christmas in my family is usually just ordering cake from bakery Holika dahan is celebrated according to hindu calendar so it changed dates every year. When I was born it was on 9th march. 19 years later, Holika dahan is again on 9th march. How cool is that? And my mom dad's wedding anniversary falls on 9th march too we start school in april then get summer vacation from mid may till 3rd week of june isn't pompeii once talked about in acor? because apart from that idk what pompeii is wow and it was featured in acor have you guys ever tried putting tortilla in unsweetened yogurt along with some salad veggies and spices? must try. its delish Oh yeah, and I am talking about whole wheat tortilla yes mix it with yogurt, veggies and spices and you get a nice breakfast if you wanna try, just google how to make roti raita yes is this duolingo? the UI has changed so much since I last used it in 2015 I used it for french no I know doge I have a book to learn german at home never got past the second page Is it a bad grade? (idk how grading works in europe here when we had grading system it was A1, A2, B1, B2, and so on till E2 here its like if you scored above 91% then A1 81% to 90% is A2 and so on till 0%-20% is E2 but surprisingly we don't have D1 and D2 and only have D which is minimum for passing hmm... the grades I am talking about starts from 6th grade for elementary, the grades are a+, a, b, c, d, e in college here we have some H,S, A something something I remember my dad getting overall S grade for M.Tech and H for his project work That was pretty impressive since he had to go to office on weekdays and college on weekends I never really got to see him relax much during those two years (apart from him watching cricket matches) My mom is a MSc but her grades are on lower side since she did it through correspondence (like you only go to college to give exams) and she didn't know how/what to study she only took MSc to keep herself busy before getting married I will join college this summer I'm really excited art is good I will be taking computer science as my specialisation nice! I will code and you can make the designs and we can release a game together yes why hmm... I have learnt C++ in high school but had to stop because I need to learn physics, chemistry and maths to clear college entrance so I haven't coded in a year And that is why I am most excited for college I will get to code again Ha! I wish, I don't even know if I'll clear college entrance computer science majors need to have the highest rank in entrance That is what my parents say. They are like - you sound like you are so smart like a national topper but then we see your marks which are nowhere near what we are expecting Thanks! In April yeah haha a lot of jinxes happening today I can talk about anything like? whoa, that's some deep science stuff 1st being? ah! should've figured Computer science all the way yeah I hate physics and chemistry and biology is on very bottom of my list just above social studies which grade you are in oh! you will get to discover phy, chem and bio in 8th or 9th ah! being held in elementary when you could be with middleschoolers Idk how it works in US. here you get to know them separately in 9th I am shocked too Here its just one school teaching from nursery to 12th grade where nursery to UKG is considered kindergarten then 1st-5th is primary, and 6th to 12th is secondary with 11th and 12th being senior secondary most private schools are nursery-12th. public schools are mostly 1st-12th since govt. doesn't consider preschool necessary I studied till 5th in private then went to public school yeah now we play?! two truths and a lie choices' fav game you begin oof that's tough i guess the 2nd is a lie oh! then which one was lie hmm.... 1. I have a younger sister who hates barbie dolls, 
2. I hate apple products
3. I have subscribed to linus tech tips brb I'm back and you are wrong Its the first one I hate apple because they are overpriced. And I have a brother who hates barbie dolls first is a lie buying youtuber merch is wasting money imo and you seemed like you would be smart kid heh I mean 30usd for a hoodie? please We get hoodies here for about 15usd oof! that is wayy too overpriced the hoodies I have are all 15-20usd each yeah. I have a hoodie that says CuTe (copper tellurium) for about 13usd I hate wearing uniform tbh our uniforms are cringey this was my school uniform from 9th to 12th this is the worst uniform ever nah, its more comfortable than what we had from 6th to 8th wow doge, that's really nice uniform I like wearing jeans and t shirt is it hot in europe during summers? its really nice and comfortable I just found they are changing uniforms for my school. again yeah my whole back used to be wet when I came home during summers because of that jacket thingy sports uniform were good tho you had to wear the colour according to the house you were given. mine was green its just t shirt with track pants yes it mostly is I always looked forward to wednesdays and saturdays just so i could wear this dress to school it would be cool to have such uniforms we had inter house competitions every saturday and mass pt on wednesdays yeah, you don't? what 😢 we have classes 6days a week and half days on last day of month half days were amazing I wish our school had weekends off but in 11th and 12th, my school became double shift so school timings were 6:50am to 12:20pm so that was a plus ok good night the new uniforms my school is implementing looks like anime uniforms ngl byeee sleep tight good morning whitewolf I was on discord the whole time since we last had a chat just another day for me jinx jinx I mean the pokemon jinx oof! my bad 😛 🤔 sorry, it was so funny idk why nicki minaj jynxed I mean that's what the description said see #memes I'm still laughing ye but its less visible now I will not look at that meme again yes all the games from gen 1 to gen 5 which one? *cries since 3ds ain't available here* nintendo doesn't sell stuff in India yeah only way to get is through grey market where price>msrp and no warranty no no I run games on emulator drastic for ds on  mobile and vba for gb/gbc/gba on pc i have only played main series games and ash gray well i have some but I don't know how I got those they are lying in my house since forever I never collected tcg yeah idk where those cards I hav even come from thing is, no one i know watches/plays pokemon and I barely have 10 cards not to sound cliche but pikachu yeah, its cute, gets rid of team rocket... what else do you need? ah! nice! cute no wait, really? eww. my little pony 🤮 we can if you want viv is your name desiree > Like how I'm Benji here but my real name **is** Benji
@BigHutchHO that did not make any sense at all A much better example is like how my stage name is Priyudi and my irl name is Priya You said real name is instead of isn't That made more sense even though your nickname says your irl name is mikey Who is mikey anyway? I don't remember Uhh.. okay 🤷‍♂️ We'll get to see him again soon😔
I can't remember if it's the 27th or the 29th of Feb tho Kyra?
Technically no, but the diamond scenes are leading me to believe that she'll become one in book 2. the bolas cover lasted for very few days it atleast deserved to be there for longer time than covington good night That seems like a badass name for a book lmao
Surprisingly enough there's yet another choices/episode clone
Except it seems like there's more books with both male and female MCs
Heck I'm pretty sure one of the stories only has a male MC at the start too. The games called Stories: your choice
It's actually not half bad so far, but there's no customizing the mc like in Choices/episode
But I'm not bothered by it personally Yeah, I'm actually enjoying the westward bound and Ninja story!
There's stats you have to pay attention in every book I've read so far tho Yeahh thats my only gripe about it
It seems like the Ninja story is the only one where MC can have a boyfriend. Hi Viv! How are you? Is bolas releasing today? OOF! that's so late I really hate not having 3ds or switch or their emulators for that matter that emulator doesn't like to run on my PC or Laptop because they are ancient And finding legit ROMs is a different story arggh my internet! anyways, my last exam is on 17th may 2020 but if I perform exceptionally well in the exam that is on april, I will be available to learn rp after 12th april. I replied to your question 15 mins ago but then realised my internet was not working you must ping everyone and put up a poster of you conducting classes *to attract more students* lol. nice! now pin this message or ping everyone ok then pin that poster yass! anyways, Its bed time for me. Good night! Good Morning! I had the second weirdest dream in my entire life it all started with me being on a train **alone** and going to my parent's house. then when I reach the station, I get down, find my dad and then realise I left my bag in the train. Me and my dad follow the now moving train but couldn't catch it. then somehow I run in the direction of train only to find a group of people camping on railway tracks where one of them apparently looked like alexis from SK. I ask her if she knows something about my bag and she says it was brought from the train alsong with their bags so it must be kept along with other bags. I find my bag and decide to board a train to go back to the station since I was tired of running. I board the train only to find that a group of people have been infected by 'resident evil' virus and are attacking everyone on train. I somehow manage to find some army men's weapon stash on the train and take some machine guns and pass it to some daring people. then we all head over to the compartment where the infected people are and start shooting. Then we realise they also have guns ranging from pistols to even machine guns. We somehow manage to kill everyone except the leader who is quite intelligent. I realise I have no bullets left in my gun so I ask if any reloads are available. Someone give me one and I load it and wait for the leader to come. when the leader arrives( with a gun in hand, of course) I shoot all the bullets into her but **she survives**! so, I catch a bungee jumping rope which was apparently tied to the train for no reason, and jump out of the train and begin flying in the air. the leader does the same (idk why because she could just shoot me or the hundreds of people still sitting in the train) then its all me jumping to different sides of train using that rope and she foollowing. at last I get tired of holding the rope and I release my hand and land into the forest. She does the same but now I am hidden behind trees and she doesn't know that. But then **I wake up**. Dream over! The only thing I didn't understand was when I ran it took about 20 mins to reach the camper's place but on my return journey, even after a whole day of fighting in train and that bungee jump rope scene at night, I couldn't reach the station and find my dad and the train was at full speed on the return journey the entire time! that was a long dream of a 10hour sleep are they? idk. it took really long for me to type it out *time is irrelevant in dream world* remind me to never put too much soy sauce in noodles How do you guys set up the zira bot? nvm found the discord documents page with instructions yeah, there are 4 members I had disboard bot on my server and was checking how can people find my server found there are servers already made for choices game then joined this one wanna see my server? its pretty much dead btw there was this bollywood movie released about 2 years ago. now they are making a sequel of it. I think y'all will like it. Do enable captions to understand everything. I will be sending trailers of both the movies and y'all have to tell me what you think of it. 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjkFr48jk68 2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzlfeocUVhI You saw the trailers viv? Kung Fu hustle was hilarious yes Ooh wait you said dramas not movies nvm T series only funded a part of first movie The second one ain't T series I have never watched any chinese movies but my mom on other hand has watched plenty yeah, I watched when I was a kiddo So, I don't really remember the complete story Ooh! I have made a movie list to watch after my exams, I will include this one too since I don't really remember most of it anyways Most of the bollywood movies are just either remakes or stuff nobody cares about. Then comes some movies like the ones I mentioned above which make me think - "Is bollywood really what I think it is?" like the first movie was soo good and the second movie's trailer looks so promising its not some cliche shit like TRR tbh most of bollywood is TRR I do know every major and non major bollywood actors (not personally of course) yes, his movies are good for the most part those movies were phenomenal 3 idiots is so relatable to me these couple of years like you would even find students relating to 3 idiots even after 30 years especially with the JEE trend that's going on nowadays There is this web series called Kota Factory on youtube that shows what JEE is all about and how are high schoolers affected by it. It is a great web series. it is a standard test to get admission in engineering colleges google assistant says there is no chance of rain but I can hear pitter patter outside *are my ears deceiving me?* I am too lazy to go and look outside myself So, I dunno if its actually raining Ok my brother just shouted its raining so its definitely raining same the weather channel on TV said it would rain today but google is still like, no there is no chance of rain google is hit and miss here i know arigato means thank you and konichiwa means hello Happy birthday Rae! days left for my birthday are less than the number of years I have lived on earth. I just read what you wrote and tbh, it made me cringe Good night everyone! this chapter was compared to other chapters because *cough* ***olivia in leather jacket kicking ass*** Does anyone here knows how to convert pdf to jpg? yeah i have to upload my certificate as a jpg but i have it as a pdf i did it! (tho it took a long time) i printed the pdf to onenote, then saved it as png, then opened paint and saved it as jpg same I want to know more about how MC got powers? what is that planet? what happened to Dave and Sam? but that would've reduced the quality of it no viv i think someone uploaded a screenshot of pb telling it is a solo book I can't find the screenshot now but I swear it existed. Either on this server or the wikia fandom server finally found the screenshot https://discordapp.com/channels/447426832371810305/619611866884341780/680505944890671133 They could've easily made a book 2 considering how PB can drag stories, it would feel nice to see this one get a book 2 i gave up the crown but I will replay to marry fabian because *I played this book only after knowing we will become the queen and I cannot dethrone myself* Hunter doesn't deserve to be my official lover. He can be a secret if ~~he~~ I want what is sweet home alabama? ahh I think we can compile all the nice ideas from #dream-books my dream can be a short 6 chap book too! with minor adjustments of course! #dream-books I am a terrible writer I can make a youtube channel that has animated videos of crazy dreams (mostly viv's dreams) and some of my dreams too! I have adobe animate but my laptop is kinda crap for it i can remember some crazy ones and viv .... the world wants to know so that means when you were 1 year old fair enough whoa so, did you break any of your parts? oof! I was joking. you were serious I wonder how tensed your parents must've been uh-huh as they should be I was a lazy child so no serious injuries My mom used to tell that I used to catch the bedsheet to reduce the impact whenever I fell from bed but cried like some bone got fractured I was a huge drama queen in my childhood aieee... you definitely were an injury magnet neither have I my worst injury was just 2 days before my 13th birthday, i tripped on a pipe and fell on a rough sandy road. I used bandage on my leg to wear pencil jeans on my birthday which was only scratched (heavily scratched like the skin came off) but the bandage stuck with my wound. my brother recorded when my mom was trying to remove the stuck bandage and I was crying. It took almost a month to heal and the worst part was that the doctor told to keep the wound open and when I used to wait for my bus, flies would come and sit at my wound it was the worst feeling I still have a scar left the wound wasn't deep but the surface area of wound was large and it sucked to eat pain killers on birthday other than that I've only got some mild papercuts, knife cuts, steel ruler cuts, liquid soap pump bottle cuts etc. I was (am) a decent child My brother is quite opposite tho my brother can be considered 'injury magnet' none of my scars go away. I still have a scar from when I scratched myself in preschool I was 3 when that happened, it has been 15 years years since then https://media.giphy.com/media/Z0tFWbRWGwwTe/giphy.gif can I choose both? viv have a look at #baby-bump I like first day I hate - (idk I haven't heard all the OSTs) react with a 👍🏻 if anyone wanna hear my dream which I don't remember completely but its crazy nonetheless ight. it somehow started with me and my family living in US (california to be precise since I remember telling google's hq is just  a walk away). I go to school and meet (i don't remember if it was demi lovato or malinda kathleen reese). I am a fan of both of them so... Somehow I am a part of a secret agency thingy of which demi/malinda is the leader. She gets intel on a criminal that they have gone to eiffel tower and we have 10 hours to catch them The leader tells us that we all have to go and catch that criminal, I said that I can't go because my mom won't allow me go out of state. She said okay we will drop you home and head to the airport to catch the flight but since they didn't have time, they took me to the airport as well my mom is still thinking I am in school. So, we all head over to airport and realise our leader doesn't have seniority enough to get a private jet. So, we'll have to book tickets for the most recent flight. I being a miser in my dream say to book economic class tickets to save money. after much argument, leader books everyone business class **except me**. But strangely, the flight had one seat beside staircase and that was mine and the entire floor was empty. My other team members and the leader were at the top floor. (I guess economic class in dream world is quite opposite of irl eco class). So, they show me my seat and head upstairs. The flight is supposed to reach after 12 hours but we now only have 9 hours left. We talk to the pilot to ditch the only stop and head straight to Paris. So, now I wait in flight **alone** since my teammates are upstairs and immediately regret arguing about going in economic class. After fidgeting for 6 hours I feel sleepy but can't sleep since there is only 3 hours left for landing and if I sleep I will not wake before minimum 8 hours. so I keep trying to keep myself awake. (apparently the struggle to not sleep in dream feels real). We finally reach Paris and head over to Eiffel Tower We reach Eiffel tower which somehow looks like a church in my dream. It is pitch black outside but the churchlights are on. The leader tells me to hide behind main gate so that I can sneak up on the criminal if they try to escape. since its dark outside, I am easily hidden. Leader goes in, bang bang happens, criminal tries to escape. I catch him and make him fall on ground and handcuff him. Leader appreciates and I get a call from mom scolding where was I and why am I not home yet. I wake up irl and realise mom is acually shouting on me since there was my brother's tie under my pillow and he needed it as he was getting ready for school ***DREAM OVER*** So, how was it? I found the last one I told crazier I seriously can't remember if the leader was demi lovato or malinda kathleen reese but both are singers soo... it doesn't matter much hello viv! dude, ever since you told about your crazy dreams, I have made a note to remember all the dreams and post the crazy ones here also, I was thinking how about we open an animated storytime like youtube channel where we upload our crazy dreams I would animate, you'll give voice over Think about it then we'll post your dreams on YT too its confirm! Mara is queen of weird dreams are you available for 10 mins to help me? testing  a server I made Well, not yet but I am planning to learn after exam @azula I know. I have seen animation tutorials and got the gist of how it works but never really tried it myself. uggh I hate preparing for JEE My parents are strict on some areas and linient on others Like they are really strict on having a bf/gf But are linient on normal things like falling sick or getting injured They don't tell to "walk it off" so maybe that's a good thing I guess?! I took a trial of netflix last summer, I didn't like price to content ratio, so I cancelled it. Now, I have prime video, hotstar and JioCinema. I will check if parasite is available on any of those platforms and we can do a watch party well, it released on 31st jan in India so it is not yet available on any streaming service. it might come to prime video or hotstar next month we can do watch party for drishyam (suspense genre) it is a really good movie and I'll send you the link with english subtitles I would watch if I could get that movie *with english subtitles* I just gave a mock test, so my brain is tired. If its not a mind involving movie (like interstellar), I would watch it now.(also, I would need the link to that movie) I can convince my mom to come with me and watch in theatre but it wouldn't be a 'watch party' Oh! we can do one thing! You can stream it here and we all can watch join a vc and click on the little tv like icon the one with arrow I will watch how long is it tho? oof! might be difficult for me to sit till end because its about 9:47pm now *depends on when my mom and brother will come to sleep* yeah. that sounds nice last night, I got a dream where I had soo many lice that they kept falling from my hair and crawled on my whole body. oof! my last dream was ewwy hehe @DaHomieDrew I tried 123movies.link 😦 ye I am here What do you wanna talk about? aww... don't be sad hehe. everyone has that one phase in life you wanna play a game? anything. we can play skribbl.io or any other multiplayer hmm... lemme see if there is any multiplayer html5 game then skribbl.io also has mobile app if you wanna play oh! ok I hope that happens sooner than you expect! Thanks! Our culture gets overwhelming sometimes like, the weddings we have are exhausting even if we are just a guest who came for free food (speaking from personal experience btw) hey viv! how's your day been so far? just the usual I fnally figured why people were joining and leaving my server at the same time because disboard was inviting them to admin chat which is blocked for everyone except admin I made an Educational Server where people can get peer support thanks! is it like a smurf movie? ohh! tell me about it. I was making my practical file and forgot to save 4 hours worth of work only for it to be vanished due to power cut I had to type about 50 pages of code again well some of it was copy pasted yeah. atleast I saved the formatting so that was a plus otherwise add another 3 hours After that incident, I set up auto save for every minute on every office app yeah its in options *for ms office apps atleast* @MaralinaSakura I asked someone about the rulebreaker role issue in my server and they said that I need to program a bot that removes all roles except rulebreaker for specific amount of time and then gives them those roles back. So, I will have to make a discord bot to implement rulebreaker role thingy. yeah. they did something similar in their server I mean, I would vote for bolas again since it got less time but it won on 8th feb and was replaced on 15th feb but the epic cover only lasted for a week I hate the MC in that book with a passion or just make *olivia in leather jacket* an LI who dis? ohh I never heard of genderfluidity outside choices tbh I like how India recently released a film on gays And it has jitu kumar as protagonist so how can I complain gahh it took me like 20 minutes to read all those messages I graduated high school last year I will turn 19 very soon 9 mins **REEEEEEEEEEEEE** how do i get rid of dandruff completely? doesn't work doctor too expensive here i tried head and shoulders for a month and i don't use conditioner @zebreano i found this one. https://www.amazon.in/Abbott-Selsun-Regular-Anti-Dandruff-Shampoo/dp/B07PMKV7SL/ref=pd_sbs_194_t_0/258-0068134-3336854?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07PMKV7SL&pd_rd_r=ffdcb18a-ff28-4a21-9fbc-34309ed96957&pd_rd_w=HPlmi&pd_rd_wg=9h7AB&pf_rd_p=21bbdc4d-873b-48c5-a88a-70e643377944&pf_rd_r=SD1458S6V3V4PWMQKKPA&psc=1&refRID=SD1458S6V3V4PWMQKKPA why don't we have esme and aurora for mid month 😢 why is it necessary for mid month person to be LI? noooo but but- 😢 I am eager to leave my city because weather here is awful and winters here caused me to have dandruff oh okay thanks zee! I will see if I can find that one also, how often do you use that shampoo? I actually shampoo once a week *pb did a good job on rafael. zee even forgot who he was* did anyone read the bb theory i posted from reddit? how can someone drink old fermented grape juice is wayy beyond me I would never drink fermented grape juice I had eaten rum chocolate once but it tasted the same for my 8 y o self ye. it was one of those cadbury celebration rum and raisin chocolate I felt bad when they discontinued it that reminds me of the day I installed choices for the first time my chocolate had a nice flavor to it. idk if it was coz of rum or raisins my dad gets allowance(money) from his job to buy alcohol and he tells his friends to buy from it and give him the money instead no one in my family got intoxicated in their entire lives I remember my dad's collegue sending photos of any office party where everyone's glass would have a blackish brown or yellow drink and my dad will be the only one with orange drink in his glass my parents never drank any type of alcohol except cough syrup of course I remember my dad once bought red bull when I asked him to get cocacola. He thought redbull was carbonated water drink like cocacola i tasted it and immediately spat off. then gave it to my dad. he drank and immediately rushed to the washroom to spit it off. we then threw the entire can in the dust bin ever since we make disgusting faces whenever we see red bull anywhere good night everyone Rest in peace viv's cat 😢  hope you are okay viv was it the one who jumped from the bed? ohh! are you okay tho? aww... *hugs viv* I made my MC drink the red drink instead of champagne also, they don't have the budget to grow bartie pb logic is 🤯 also lets continue in #the-royal-romance do you think by the time I'll get a job (5-6 years later) I will be able to buy a phone I dreamt of in 2010 (i.e. when I was 9 years old?)
the things I wanted my phone to have - it should be a sliding phone with touchscreen (well a sliding touch and type to be precise), should be able to run internet smoothly, should have over 20 games in it, should be golden in colour, and should have a pen (stylus like the samsung note series) galaxy fold is a folding device, i need a sliding one like this I can't sleep aww... you can get them from #roles and change your name colour from #color-role-channel https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485727935412699146/684678572446580746/unknown.png can we have this instead of LI in mid month server icon? please why is the server so dead rn? *rise my fellow bolas lovers and ~~baby bump~~ sunkissed haters* oh! did you check the spoilers doge? so you didn't see ethan's outfits ok. can we have the above pic as server icon for mid month instead of LI? yass! we will convince viv, altair and furi to put it in vote because, there are no worthy LI this month also, *there's no bryce* bbb? oh! i thought you named it like bad baby bump or something ab is better abortion bump named by doge i guess?! hey furi > I almost spit out my cereal I-
@kaitoo and i almost spit out my coffee when you said that don't prune have fun cleaning yourself! do you realize i have hot coffee in my hand don't make me laugh dude bye ever since you guys told me about kezz, all I can think of is meeting her and ask all the spoilers I could get and also how she gets them. also, i was doing a lil' diggin' (sorry) and found that she also has chat books scripts *but i still wanna read them* I don't care if they use keys. and I couldn't find all of the chat stories chapters there was one hss one too this never showed up when i searched chat stories thanks @literal legend. and @oge !!! @kaitoo  No, it's the notification settings. This server has notify on mentions as default. You can change that for whole server or specific channels like general and choices chat. (Totally up to you)! I'm gonna go have my breakfast + lunch. Then I'll continue my search on who died in OH2. Byee! Power is finally back!!! Thank God!!! my brothers school got closed till 31st march now he is crying in a corner since he had 2 exams left and they are most probably cancelled now my brother cried because he prepared for the exam only to find that it got cancelled heh. me neither he's a creep who hates me with a passion idk what incel is but creep in like I love dragon ball series and i want a stick to fidget all the time. I also wanna scold my sister everytime for no particular reason and not let her come near mom. he is 10 years old ^^ yass. he is a villain actually, weirdo is a better word to describe him 😛 *I am hearing this for the past 10 years* he will turn 11 in may he hits me when I try to hit him and he is wayy too attached to our mom he doesn't let anyone come near her and the reason he gives me is - you had mom for 8 years. now let me spend some time with her **alone** ^^ that's cute I tried talking to him about dragon ball with full interest. his first question - "what do you need from me?" I said nothing. I just wanna know why you like it so much he said - "tujhe kya hai" (why do you wanna know/what difference does it make to you?) he is the one who tells me that I am mentally 4 years old I did ask him that. he said - you annoy me. you are clingy and only show off that you want mom. I asked my mom - am I that annoying. she said - "sometimes" and I am speechless after that yeah. she mostly takes his side "because he is younger" Idk he is like that since he was born at this point. my dad is like - "hey priy, let's make a team together and let them be a team. we are better off without them" wait wut? you wanna give me advice PB gave? bad people never turn around. redemption only happens in story he'll never remember I'm definitely sure of that. He doesn't even remember the struggle I had to face to get him the games he needed for his birthday he didn't even thank me for the games 😢 and the 3 hours I spent designing his cake on photoshop because he wanted all his favourite pokemon on one cake then he cried because the baker covered the sides with cream to make a frame and unown got hidden in that frame at least I won't have to do anything on his birthday. I and he are combining all our birthday money to buy keyboard yeah. its about 200usd. so 100usd from my side and 100 from his music yamaha psr e363 thanks! (hopefully he'll let me use it) if he doesn't, I'll throw a tantrum the most expensive gift he got so far was the 60usd cricket gear kit hehe. I will try to convince him for that *technically its my dad's money which he was planning to give me to buy my bday gift but whatever* you are right. I will tell him to let me use it half the time ✊🏻 sure. I will talk to him about it tomorrow because I don't wanna piss him at night since we sleep on the same bed anyways, I asked a friend of mine who knows coding and he said that it was a compiled file and hence it is out of his expertise to make it completely readable. we need kezz if we wanna know who died in OH2 @Kezz please help us! 🙏🏻 morning doge! (well, afternoon for me) "I wonder when I love me is enough" (my jam rn) I have a feeling choices will close down by dec2020 Where did you get that? Can I have it too? Omg hi kezz!!! I was soo eager to meet you!!! you ARE like a celeb in my mind! Doge told me you could get scripts of chapters before they were released and since then I wanted to ask you - will you teach me? YAY Kezz!!! You back! (Sorry if I sound clingy rn) I am actually seeing you for the first time since I joined but people here made me have an impression that you are bad~~ass~~ bad butt (only thing I liked in BaBu) I wish you could have seen me shouting a few hours ago My mom was like - "what's wrong with this girl? did she won a lottery?"

One of the few apps that have male MCs and doesn't force them to be straight. Tbf it just started out, I dont expect the plot to be super heavy at starting chapters even when it's a sequel huge :OOF: to both of you I can somewhat relate?! I never go out of my house unless my mom is dragging me to go somewhere with her play games on PC/Mobile to pass time umm... maybe watch youtube videos?! hmm... maybe learn new skill/cover syllabus in advance its been almost an year since I have gone out for anything productive. I have only gone out to touristy places with my parents to click pictures and show on instagram that i have a life too what is jackbox? how do you play? I am free and might play if i like oof! i am on my laptop i can play skribbl.io if you want @azula ok. lets try don't blame me if i screw up tho is there a way to check how much xp I have in this server/what is my rank? yeah they did and they forgot *or did they?* nahhh PB is on otherside You know what, I am excited for a BaBu 2 (because I love memes and I hope this will be a bigger meme than the first) My mom is being a paranoid now. Like one of our family friends came home to meet us and they were telling how when they were at a place in the morning, there were all foreigners and now my mom is like- what if they got corona from those foreigners and now they passed it down to us I mean, there are like 15 cases in my city but w/e 74 in entire country My country revoked all visas and prevented most international flights from taking off/landing here I am queen of death and I decree no one from this server or their loved ones will die maybe I do have near death experiences every day... You never know... oh! that reminds me of a movie my brother was talking about called pet cemetry something also, Good luck Altair! I have almost crashed my scooty in order to prevent hitting a dog :200iq: I wish I had nitro. :sad: 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥 *Imma burn this place down. Whee!!!* y'know, we should start burning the whole world so that corona virus dies down due to heat and everything can go back to normal 🌧️ (you mean this?) Dude! Am I in trouble? no I kinda helped someone on the internet last year. He told me to be in touch but I didn't really do anything. He somehow remembered my birthday and emailed me (on my fake email which I gave him) I just checked my fake email id his bday is on 14th march should I wish him? not really ok. I am still amazed by the fact people on internet care more about my bday than irl people *should've opened my social media accounts sooner* deleted that message cuz his email-id was visible tom hanks who? ,im tom hanks never saw him anywhere XD :OOF: hehe. bio is the worst imo I- I hate bio because I suck at memorizing stuff I would rather do more math CS is the best! can't change my mind lol hi doge! online exams are good no? ohh.. thats sad well, good luck! mayybee I never had to learn these stuff https://discordapp.com/channels/447426832371810305/447581814400221194/687843646187503672 huh? Our visit to presedential estate was cancelled due to corona. goddangit! I mean, I am staying home for a year with occasional visits outside and never really complained but it took me 2 weeks to get passes and they cancelled it it was just 3 dollars but the passes were of visiting 'the president's house' The hailstorm is NOT helping curb coronavirus did the chapter release yet? I am gonna give a mock test. So I will be busy for next 3 hours. Please do not ping me! thanks! :OOF: *I was never invited to a cult* 😢 I- I am a kool kid! right Paige? you can maybe call them DJ 😿 yay! Paige came to my rescue! ILY Paige! *GO PAIGE!* *GO PAIGE!* i am confused if i should let jackie win or not orr.... we can ditch everyone and put aurora/esme instead or we can put cassian elijah i don't want jackie to win same when is the poll ending tho bad bot B E S T times I know, we should be Bread sometime Hi Cassandra! Nah she is someone I invited she wanted to rp but viv does https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447581814400221194/679750035269091358/Screenshot_20200220-020339_PicsArt.jpg I gave her viv's username and an invite to this server I mean, who's stopping us to do rp? also, i didn't wanna scare viv by directly telling someone to DM her y'know there was someone with username Grrrrrrr. They once asked how are you and I answered " I'm @Grrrrrrreat! :dopeycry: Morning Paige! we suprisingly have 2 lady cassandra on this server 👀 Desire and Decorum? isn't that a game made up by PB for tyler I vote to sacrifice Furi too! Also, its time for BoLaS now! Bye... :dopeycry: raven, do :dopeycry: since I don't have nitro can we have these emojis here? I can send you orignal ones instead of screenshots sent :dopeystarey: All the best to your doggo! https://animals.howstuffworks.com/pets/how-to-give-first-aid-to-your-dog26.htm maybe this'll help Drew, shall I tell one thing honestly? Whenever I look at your pfp, idk why does it look like two dogs are kissing and that blue colour is sky 😳 how many puppies is she giving birth to? Are you planning to keep all of them to yourself or give some for adoption? :dopeywhat: Winnie! (Because Riley reminds me of TRR instead of Disney) What, I can't let jackie win tbh i don't care who wins I am not voting I am not voting because none of the LIs deserve to be server icon I wanted Bryce but the one I really want literally never wins so why bother lol why don't we have cassian since we all know DS is gonna takeover next moth's icons? should have just @ here to prevent everyone's sanity same YAAASSSSS!!!!! ES all the way 😭 me too!
we are not screaming Imma go eat my food Well tbf no ones screaming
I mean unless complaining = screaming then nvm ignore me:Cringe: SO I GUESS CAPS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU HUH uggghhh jackie in scrubs atleast keep jackie in casual (or her white coat 😳) Why not just make the server icon the same as the app, to avoid fights n shit? I'm surprised that hardly no one knows how to check who pinged them yet Tbh I miss the old icon with all the LIs on it😔 The fucks jackbox?
Am I too old or too young not to know what that is? 24hr vets mayhaps? m!hug everyone i am gonna create a server, invite marriage bbot hug everyone, then delete the server pixelberrystores.com didn't they have hss prime merch? https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016J3QJDS HSS Prime merch still selling on amazon for 15 bucks thanks for the welcome guys 🙏 > Favorite book and LI?
@oge TRR Liam and HSS Skye hehe true are you talking about s korea? @azula oh take care how many active cases? @azula  oof i see hope you pass through this hard time safely! > Welcome! @Deleted User
@Raven 🙏 😄 Aren't they available online? good point. I remember the book shop once estimating no. of books to be ordered very wrong and everyone (except like 10 people) had to take printout of book from the internet to study until he restocked that book And the saddest thing was - I wasn't one of those 10 people and had to take printouts we printed 3 chapters :OOF: ahh the books were restocked after summer vacation so... we didn't suffer much I remember my friends (whose dad worked in the same office as my dad) telling how their dad would get prints from their office. My dad always was like - I will not use office resources for personal work. So, we always had to take printouts outside till we purchased our own printer because, they would say why don't you ask your dad to do it himself. he is in the same office also, all my irl friends are b`****`es Idk. I thought it was a bad word Now that I have a printer (even though if its b&w) I don't have to worry nothing in my house is older than me (except a few utensils and containers my parents purchased when they were newly married) and they still work? damn! Our fridge was purchased in 2000 and was replaced in 2016 because it didn't have enough storage and the ice compartment stpped working and we got our first microwave in 2008 iirc and was replaced in 2015 so, you don't need them now? I haven't watched Harry Potter but I'll take all the spoilers what?! really? dumbledore is the old man with long white beard right? mine will never do (I hope) how does furi has a photo of when he was 25 that is colour and digital if he is 75 now? and, sorry dotto can't relate. but do not think about doing that can be. his roles does say he is from europe How can i be part of the 'family tree'? but who would add me... *looking at doge* so, hello to all my relatives whom i may or may not know so, is hsm: tm,ts and hsm like hss:ca and hss? i have heard hsm tm ts has same school but different students it has released in india and i am thinking of watching it what about 7 months? no. and don't worry. That was the gap between my very first and second period yeah my friends were looking at me like - you sure you aren't pregnant i was like, you need a boyfriend for that to happen and I never had one yeah XD I still don't know if I like boys or girls. mostly asexual, sometimes bisexual heh. that might be the case with me. I never found anyone attractive irl I find the thought of kissing someone disgusting for some reason i mean, i would like to cuddle with someone maybe or maybe its my upbringing that makes me think this way I mean, I'm Indian. Indian parents don't like talking about it and my dad is very vocal about love marriage and having boyfriends my mom is chill tho tbh i didn't know about 'dingledoo' until 9th grade when I actually searched the net because I was curious I want someone who can cuddle with me and understand me and someone who I can share all my secrets. that's all. It doesn't matter if they are a boy or girl thankyou! I hope so too! monexual?! do you know she has a choices fan account on instagram? by the name aljay_bhandari she posts cool edits and releases all the dresses and backgrounds as soon as the first chapter is released she got it. i explained her so, wanna bet 1k tatsu credits? also, tatsumaki is not in this server so, Idk how can I explain you ok. @kaitoo wanna bet 1k tatsumaki credits for when bd2 comes out? ight! altair, can we atleast have casual clothes jackie or white coat jackie as server icon? i can get you one my mom used to play this game iirc I *tried* to join jackie's assets. its posted in #feedback-and-suggestions did y'all notice that discord was down for like 10 minutes? Thanks Doge! *Is this the end of world as we know it?* (Read in OH MC voice) yeah. i was unable to open discord for 10 minutes and yes we can receive your messages paige! *is this really the end of world as we know it?* I wish my entrance next month gets cancelled. (but no one should die for that to happen) college, uni whatever you call it I don't wanna give entrance next month 😭 yeah heard same thing happened for xbox live too yes In my country, probably about a 100 cases and 2 deaths and one death was in city i currently live in. the other was in city i will move to in summer this year there isn't any lockdown or anything here. only primary students grade 1-5 got holidays till march 31 my country (mainly my city) got cases from a family coming back from italy who celebrated their kids birthday lavishly they banned in india too till 15 april like the father was infected, he went to job where there are 100s of employees, their two kids went to different schools, the kids who came at their bday party were from different schools, their families were from different offices so yeah. one family started it all and that happened in feb end yeah our presedent's estate tour was also cancelled because of that 😢 i just want my exams to get postponed indefinitely due to preventive measures that's all means they were not checking properly. or were telling the truth and other countries are hiding it i was surprised to see india didn't have that many cases even though it literally shares borders with china i am supposed to be getting at least 200 in mock tests but i am only getting like 75. so rip me I am not in school so idk also, its exam season here so no studying students just go to give exams no classes whatsoever till 31st march anyway does any of you have anything to motivate me to study? because as much as i want the exam to postpone. i know its not gonna happen i mean i know but i always end up not studying even after realising that i am on my *bed* ehh i am neither genius nor rich *unless you think 75/300 is genius* i wanna study comp sci. but the entrance asks questions from phy, chem and math i mean i don't think there will be that much calculus in comp sci this exam is freaky search JEE on net and you'll know what I'm talking about yeah. especially computer science but i don't wanna study i wanna make discord bots and websites and code something not solve integrations and memorise the structure of polymers I know. I had C++ in school since i already had a taste of coding. i wanna do more i know a little SQL I had CS for 2 years in high school I made a C++ command line application that stored calendar events I mean I can, but I'll have to see the syntax and classes that are to be used I would rather study now before my parents see me chatting. will try doing it later tho! I also have to give a mock test soo... bye! have fun! can we all have a watch party some time? of any movie you can do @ here *makes me wonder why furi @ everyone instead of @ here to control people from screaming resulting in many people asking - why am i pinged?* 🤔 good evening viv! do you guys remember a game called doodle god? so, i somehow wanted to play that game and I was looking at the comments and look what i found opened http://www.physicsgames.net/ my all time fav. website to play games because I am feeling so nostalgic today. the mobile one is bad imo but the web one is fun. good! @kaitoo she found it. stop looking for your PC *Are chromebooks even worth it?* I mean they are cheap and get basic work done so should be good for anyone who uses a computer for office work and we browsing but still... is it touch enabled? Oh! I have been meaning to ask, Viv! How is Elsa now? thank god your dog is okay! and don't panic, get yourself tested to be sure and hope for the best! pharmacies should be open during lockdown no? I mean you can talk to your mom about it right? She would understand 😦 that reminds me, I still haven't finished my rant about BD This is sad.. ,im yippee does lockdown mean you can't order online? I pity on those officers who have to stay out when everyne else are in their homes for me its nothing different it has been 1 year since I have gone outside for school/college/work etc but yeah, this corona thing is delaying the purchase of my birthday gift. viv! you'll get through this. I hope you will be safe and healthy (pregnant or not) I mean I can show you some food that will make you feel not hungry oh yeah! that reminds me, my country had another citizen die due to corona he was from mumbai f=9/5c+32 that's how i remembered the formula idk how to convert anything else tho if c=100, then f=9/5(100) +32 c=k-373.15 its not complicated one degree celcius= 274.15kelvin rise in one degree celsius = rise in one kelvin but 1C=274.15K you are confusing T with delta T yeah. fuck physics ruined my life fuck physics, chemistry, maths and social studies and hindi hindi and sst aren't related to maths but are bad and cs is related to maths but is good Hindi = national language of India ahh makes sense yeah. because *south indians* but I like living in south India I have a love hate relationship with maths currently its on hate phase I can't trash talk about maths at home because my mom had math as her major and she loafs maths my brother also loafs maths that happened when she tried to teach me biochemistry few days ago by the end we were mutually helping each other my mom is always like- math is so easy especially calculus and algebra and I'm like that's the only things i hate about maths My mom is like master of all trades. she cooks great food (almost any cuisine), she makes amazing paintings, knows and loves math, has a teaching degree (that allows her to be a high school teacher), plays video games, also, she designs clothes for me and my dolls *i'm sure i am forgetting something but don't know what* My mom is amazing. My dad however.... I passed high school last year but didn't join college looks fun Paige! should definitely try and post in #art-channel Hi Ella! (I'm PriSha) Hey everyone 🙂 I just joined so I'm like confused what's going on this is the general chat where literally anything can happen I'm usually on insta that's why we have different channels to talk about different things That sounds cool Anyone played witness ?

Govt. websites are also pain in the ass Yeah I feel like 2020 is all about Coronavirus yeah. we (me and my family) were supposed to shift to a different city this summer. I am trying to book tickets for that since yesterday. the tickets cost like 350usd. So, the money gets debited but the ticketing website shows payment has not been made. I tried calling the customer care and they say that they have technical issue with their servers. And the refund will take 3-7 working days to process. so far I tried twice and the same thing happened both the times. I feel like my mind is gonna explode any moment now Yeah its cute tho and maybe equal in size to my drawing tablet Is there any like server where I can share edits Becuase I done blades edit with my new human MC 👍 thanks 😁 Wait what You were pregnant ? Ikr But that's good Thanks for future reminder Viv I watched most of them because I was fascinated by the fact that she shares birthday with me I also bought dolls only to shave their head and then break their limbs I was a... destructive child My mom made me a really cool doll house with cardboard and thermocoal and stitched dresses for my dolls so that was pretty cool but she always got upset when she saw my toy box with naked limb-less shaved headed barbies that occasionally had pen marks on them i still don't know why i did that tho Lol 🎵 tell me what to do- oo... about witness? 🎵 MY COUNTRY IS TESTING COUNTRY WIDE LOCKDOWN THIS SUNDAY thanks! (even though it has almost been a month since I went out) Quarantine sucks I hate it already I miss college man I can't see my friend I face timed but it's not same I just wanted garlic pizza but I am scared to go to shops For me it's 20th April but idk Same @Raven Is it the end of the world yet I didn't been tested My mom is panicking and seeing her, my brother is also panicking I mean people here are fighting for bread @2-D UK @Andromeda Uk our maid just came back from her vacation and she didn't know how much loss has happened in the entire world and how important is it to stay at home and wash your hands every now and then. my mom gave her a 30 minute lecture about it my country crossed 150 iirc and one more died from maharashtra and viv! don't panic! you'll not die. at least not on my watch! I was an extrovert until 8 years ago then I became an introvert my dad is telling to stock up for 1 month because he thinks the govt. is hiding something to prevent panic Waaah! If a lockdown happens, I won't be able to be on discord all day because my dad will then tell me to study I self study for entrance exam since the last one year. yes it is. that is why he is asking me to study more. because competition will get tougher I need to be in top 5000 kids 1.3 million approx thanks! I don't wanna study tho I wish no one else studies so i can get good rank I am bored and got nothing to edit Lol me too. but I am not willing to do any of those things i have to study, complain to the gas office about duplicate bill. book tickets for this summer, clean my bedside table, organize my closet. and order the musical keyboard then have an interactive study session with my mother on organic chemistry where we both teach other in order to clear my concepts oh no. I don't. My mom studied organic chemistry almost 30 years ago My mom is cool in that way. yes. She has knowledge of every subject. Some subjects, her knowledge is less (biology), some subjects she is an expert (maths) thank god I don't have biology tho just one chapter of biochemistry is what you call biology for me I am lucky in aspect that my parents supported my decisions of choosing subject combination in class 11th but, the fact I had to take physics chemistry and maths in order to learn computer science is bad also, the fact i have to compete with 1.3 million students *for a college admission* Ugh computer science I hate it It's not bad sometimes But it's sometimes pain in the arse I loaf computer science Ight, imma sleep now! good night and stay safe y'all! hhhhhh my dad called from office to tell not to book tickets since he got a notification that there shouldn't be any movement in the next 3-4 months. and the website from where we ordered groceries is getting emptier. like most of the things are now going out of stock. now I am in panic mode. we only have groceries that will last upto 15 april @Deleted User  doing janta curfew? janta curfew is just a test for one day this will be a test to see panic in citizens before implementing something harsh like a lockdown it will be a normal day for me tho since i haven't really gone out this past year. last time i set foot out of my house was 29 feb only because my family booked the change of guard ceremony at president's estate i see i am not much of an outgoing person so i dont mind social distancing :LMFAOdead: though i still miss those days when corona was just a beer company and not such an infectious virus i still cant imagine the entire country under lockdown hehe I don't have any friends to socialize irl soo... social distancing is what I'm doing my entire life nothing new for me nice Imma go back to reading trh2 ch9 (don't know why is it taking so long for me to read it) 👍 Hey everyone Hi Ella!

Heyo! I'm back This time on my mom's phone My mom slept, lights are off But I can't sleep (mainly because of BB) I have never tried ali express I trust Amazon and Flipkart for all my needs Amazon used to be bad here before 2015 It's wayy better now after they introduced prime Flipkart used to be the best place to get original stuff for cheap. Now it's getting beaten by Amazon in almost every way. my brother is writing a book titled 'the mastermind behind corona virus' rn. 😨 Hello! What's your fave book and LI if you don't mind? How did you find this place? (It's not much of a secret hideout but still...) Cool! Me too! what does Acab mean? wasn't this gif an inspiration for the blonde hair in OH? the hairstyle was named sure jan I don't remember my high score since I played using ***modded apk*** I mean the first thing I ever search whenever I hear about a game is mod Only the candy crush games are the ones I never played with mods yup! lucky patcher doesn't work most of the time So, our Prime Minister announced a country wide lockdown till 14 april. My dad went out to find some more groceries because we still don't know if it'll extend. As soon as he went out, it started raining. EVEN WEATHER GOD WANTS US TO SUFFER!!! 😭 I think its safe to say for me that i will be entering college with my juniors 😂 😭 I have already taken a drop year. I can't afford another one Indeed If you go out here the police is hitting you with sticks Unless its for essential items heh. Idk what is happening outside of my house. too lazy to look through the balcony So its pretty fun to see people who are  breaking curfew to get beaten by 2 to 3 police with sticks Hehe I had soo many plans for this year But this year became a joke for everyone Yeah I dunno i feel its justified when there is repeated notice to stay at home laato ke bhoot baato se nahi mante And still some people go out anyways, moving on Yeah its everyone's personal opinion they are allowed to go that far. I think the police is only catching those who are on main roads 🙏 :eyez: . ayy Anyone heard about hantavirus? Well it has been there since 1950s But one person in china has died today Either it can be just a normal death Or the beginning of another epidemic... > Question did that person recover from Corona lately ?
@Tyr i dunno about that https://www.firstpost.com/health/man-dies-from-hantavirus-in-china-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-virus-and-how-it-spreads-8184521.html But theres nothing to worry about,  it spreads from rats and it has a vaccine Not human to human contact Shit.. :OOF: recovered from ebola virus-> recovered from coronavirus-> recovered from hantavirus-> death by common cold.. :OOF: :OOF: Clash royale Ok. Now I am officially going to sleep (I guess?!) Anyone know any mods for netflix ?? I had one before but I accidentally deleted it I just can't afford netflix rn Tbh not really I had it before and it was total legal I mean I somehow got hack for choices I didn't watched You season two yet I still got Riverdale season 3 to catch up on and season 4 And then teen wolf and 13 reason why and pretty little liars spin off So many shows to catch up on I recently downloaded, it worked for me Wait, lemme send you a screenshot See number of coins and rings yup but I started from the beginning without trying to log in anywhere ~~I screenshotted the fanciest part 😳 ~~ can you screenshot what happens when you install? mine is 5.4.0 uninstall HSS prime, then try this link http://www.mediafire.com/file/0zontxa9zrr3roi/HIGH-SCHOOL-STORY-MOD-APK-5.4.0.apk/file this is where I downloaded every time its from andropalace I get choices mod apk from there too ayy! *same pinch!* yw! (I wonder why it didn't work the first time tho) hmmm... anyways, have fun playing! also, that website has one for hwu if you wanna try yup! also, you can just tap through the initial dialogues to speed up Hey everyone so I just woke up and my Bloodbound 4 petition went crazy 92 people signed already like 0_0 Well many people wants to Including me Well there's still not many solved things I think it will be good to have BB 4 but I respect your opinion I will form my opinions after reading ch 16 because I really don't want BB to turn into TRH I mean I love trh So But yeah true Its not like pb will change their minds I just wanted to do something nice to the fandom ... So I made the petition I feel like TRH wasn't needed and TRR ended at a good place. The story is meh (neither good nor bad), Its just that I want BB to hold a special place in my heart which idk will be possible with a 4th book or not. I like your initiative but I still don't know how I'll feel about a 4th book Theres a 4th book coming? Oh Hmm > And tbh I wouldn't trust PB with their recent books
This is the main reason I am not sure if I want a 4th book or not hmm... do we have anything else to discuss about in this topic I am playing tentrix for the past 6 hours *and I only play tentrix when I am extremely bored* https://tenor.com/view/bored-nothing-to-do-scream-angry-gif-14108104 I would love quarantine if my brother didn't use my mom's phone all day *because my parents won't get me one till sophomore year of college* I can convince them to give me one for my next birhtday but not earlier than that Earlier, when my brother used to go to school, I had access to my mom's phone everyday for atleast 3 hours. Now, I hardly can use my mom's phone to check instagram everyday Oh! I do have a phone for emergencies tho It is like everyday except my brother has the phone all day and my dad keeps bugging me every hour My brother and I don't have the best relationship so... I neither confirm nor deny that oh yeah! Welcome Saamm! what is the difference between damn and darn? makes sense yup oop DS early april ugghhh... you are right wait, TRH 32 actually yass! XD 32 variations and I think each has 4 different outfits no. you can't choose but they have 4 outfits for different occasions maybe any art (if we get one) from ch 16? can we include AVSP in polls? its out for VIP but yeah I get it Well it seems Prince Charles has also been tested positive.. WHO CARES ABOUT PRINCE CHARLES! I NEED BB CH 16!!! I can't take the suspense any longer Nahh... I'm good. Just wanted to let it out VIP book no You set out for England determined to uncover one of the aristocracies' oldest family's secrets. But will you find romance instead? AVSP = A very scandalous proposal good night everyone! Good morning! Soo, we didn't get BB Ch 16 but got DS Ch 1. Great! And my laptop is NOT turning on! Great! :OOF: they technically gave us the freshman side stories for free sooo.... :OOF: that's short oo My school had 45 minute lectures too. but once a week we used to get block lectures meaning two consecutive lectures of same subjects we had those with every subject except english we didn't have any break tho :OOF: We have survived 135 minutes on a maths lecture once (there was block lecture and the next lecture teacher was absent so the maths teacher took that lecture too) I will go to college this year so idk how things work there heh 🤯 quarantine is like everyday for me *except now my brother keeps having my mom's phone and my dad keeps bugging me every hour* did you play candy crush? what level are you at? hmm... I used to play from 8th grade to 10th grade I was at three hundred something. don't exactly remember but I have cleared 1400+ levels in candy crush soda tho *Its the only game I played without mod/hack* soda was easy. I could clear 70ish levels in one day cleared almost 800 levels during summer vacation after 10th grade :OOF: aww! cuute! aww... hmm... that's great actually. nice! last monday or tuesday iirc *that sounds so wrong* But if you look at the message before realising you are talking about bitlife Look at you guys, talking about virtual lives like it's your real life *is that even possible?!* I have my mom's mobile since my brother is watching a movie today Imma go play HSS prime since this discussion is... I don't like this release schedule tbh can we also include DS in poll? since its releasing on 3rd april *but the cover is good* its 27th march today poll will be on 1st april does that mean we can include DS? i don't want trh or witness to win tbh and there will be 6 LIs to choose from *yet bolas changed on 8th feb* as long as DS is in the poll, i have no problem with when the poll takes place 🥳 ^ its actually 3 but edward has 4 customizations all released in sneak peeks no, there are 4 DS! DS! yes Also, I have the game files, so I can provide the original cover I was told since Bolas won in feb, it wouldn't be in poll and OH will also not be in poll yup I'm voting DS *even though the cover is cliche but w/e* yeah yup! edward has 4 customizations so, there will be 6 options in LI poll (thank god you can't change his hairstyle like cassian) I think I might go with oliver oliver is navy lieutenant charlie is quartermaster and MC (female) is from OH Edward is the *sexy pirate captain* according to PB I think i put wayy too many croutons in my soup this time Even I can't name most of the countries in Europe and I am not American... But in all seriousness, they use England to create diversity without having to research much ^ what? :OOF: Atleast I can point all the 29 states and capitals in India lol do you have a europe outline map? I wanna see how many countries can I get right? (just don't make fun of me) largest one is russia (duh) then at south we have italy my laptop crashed within 30 seconds of clicking the first link my laptop needs something light weight it can't handle ram heavy websites In my defence, I never liked geography and never studied it after 10th grade *and thus my result is not good* my brother might name more countries than me hi! fave book and li? I forgot combodia was a country frick! me too lemme see how well my brother scores since he has some interest in geography my brother is being moody *I'm telling you, he hates me* rome is also a country right? i got italy and vatican right and I forgot about greece I just realized there is a world map hung in the room I am sitting in *I never looked at it my entire life* 🤦🏻‍♀️ you can do it mara! concentrate *you forgot bangladesh?* jk you did exceedingly well my brother disappointed me. he got 34 right I got 52 I always struggled with social studies Glad I didn't have to study it after 10th grade I can mark every state and state capital in India but my world geography is *very poor* my brother at one point while attempting was like - "which countries have more corona cases" I laughed so hard then he wrote west indies as a country the best part was him trying greenland 4 times when the correct name was denmark this is my brother's result (he is 10 years old) and europe tbh, even I couldn't do africa well https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447581814400221194/693092604342173736/unknown.png this is my result major f for south america *lemme see if I can convince my mom for this* wayy better than I could ever do furi, do you know Indian states? not even 1? wait, wut? really? ehh.. somewhat. we have 29 states idk how different states in america are but we don't have different taxes we have state governments that look after local tasks like sanitation, police and stuff. then there is central government which handles things from a national perspective I mean, India has 1000+ spoken languages yeah I was just asking about Indian states to see how much people from other country know about India. also, just attempted indian states and I forgot 2 of them, oop! 😳 i knew there was one from M but I could only remember mizoram and tripura just swept from my mind I know those in the east are the seven sisters and are the hardest to remember I always confuse in them because they are tiny ~~and insignificant~~ *also, this quiz didn't include jammu because it recently broke into a state and 2 union territories* I like how a question by mara of why writers choose europe as a far away place turned into a geography quiz discussion! o.O we can all play atlas sometime like players take turns to name countries that start with the alphabet the previous country ended but we will first need to see who all are playing and set a order for how the game goes we can use 196 countries but no repitition *there is an extended version where you can also name states, rivers, that kind of stuff but since players here are from different parts of the world, confirming if a place listed is real or fake will be difficult* so we can keep it to 196 countries only ^ I am confused as well me too i know that hockey is national sports of India but other than that... no, I meant the *hockey* hockey the one you play with stick on land the one on which chak de india movie was made my head is reading "All around you, the ***brits*** come to life with tangling vines and brambles!" while reading ILITW rn I read brits instead of woods I'm not a sports girl soo... DAN IS NOW HAUNTED!!! YAY!!! AVA IS HAUNTED!!! YAY!!! ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT TAEKWONDO? sorry for caps! 😛 oh! my brother learnt it for 3 years before we moved. He couldn't continue because there aren't any classes nearby he was taught WTF version iirc he went to like green belt with stripes. idk. his uniform had WTF written on it and then there were weekly classes in his school here (20 classes give or take in an entire year) but their uniform had ITF he took the ITF one here for one year but his coach demoted him to white belt for some reason. so  he didn't continue now, we will move again this summer (if all goes well) (perks of transferable job) and he asked our mom about continuing taekwondo there *if they allow him to continue with green belt* he has them what's that? idk all that never really showed interest in what he does he has 2 bronze medals he won in state competitions tho and like 2 ID card thingies my uncle is black belt (2nd dan iirc) in karate ahh i see heh my brother was still green belt with stripes. and he was 7 years old when he had to leave taekwondo he was a scaredy cat who got bullied everywhere. so we sent him to learn taekwondo now, he *is* a bully atleast he bullies me I never know what happens to my confidence level it fluctuates within seconds wym? *are you talking about bitlife?* morning Paige! i rechecked the image to see if anything was nsfw, but couldn't find anything *also, I saw puppies feeding for the first time* even if i try, i could never spell anything to make it sound childish parasite released on prime video today but i can't watch it umm... idk. I guess I'm a unique personality 🤷🏻‍♀️ hmm... maybe I'm like Alex Russo (wizards of waverly place) Plot for Ghajini : `A tycoon, suffering from acute short-term memory loss, cannot remember anything beyond fifteen minutes. With a bunch of polaroids and tattoos on his body, he sets out to find his lover's killer.` I love this movie It is. lemme see if I can find this with english subtitles I haven't watched memento but yeah. that sounds very similar yeah. but the flash back plot might be different The ending of Ghajini was that the protagonist was able to kill the villain and then lived peacefully and his doctor gifted him what his lover made before dying its a good movie. I don't think they would have copied the entire plot. Its just the premise interesting indeed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw6QQdFEfeo this is the link of movie with english subtitles uggh... I hate the smell of henna nice I'm a hindu too Lord Ganesha? ooh! cool! Bramha - Creator, Vishnu - (idk the word in english but he is responsible for the life cycle) Shiva- Destroyer you know how to read sanskrit? ohh I learnt sanskrit from 5th to 10th grade Maybe plan a visit after this whole pandemic fiasco ends oohh! which one? *I haven't watched it* But I have heard of it I can give you cool bollywood movie suggestions if you want tho It was directed by hollywood director but shot in India iirc and had Indian actors do you like suspense genre? If you like suspense, then I recommend this movie - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4PPJ6crBQU I had to google his name because I never heard of him 😛 I haven't watched any marvel movies except endgame and far from home hmm.. I've seen detective pikachu don't remember seeing him lmao I have soo many movies in my watch list. I will watch all of them after exams but this pandemic is not letting it happen now they have postponed till last week of may the backstory in ghajini was so funny and ironic. The female protagonist works for an ad company and spreads rumors that she is friends with the business tycoon to get better ads. The tycoon comes to confront her but is mistaken for a person who wants to audition for ads. the tycoon starts loving her and keeps his identity a secret. so, the villain kills the female protagonist for reasons I won't spoil. She dies on the day the tycoon decides to reveal his identity and he could never tell her that she is literally friends with the business tycoon she spread rumors about I gotta confess something... *I promised to my mom that I will never play choices so that she could allow me to play BB finale as soon as it released* I will upload the chapters but never play on her mobile 😢 technically the promise is I will never play any game on her mobile till my exams are over and I get admitted to college emulators keep crashing on my laptop no 💰 ohh.. tried like 3 emulators none work well I wish I had my own phone i mean I have for emergencies (its a burner phone) but no smartphone because its a distraction to students *below average* it wasn't banned before. they started by limiting my usage now its out of reach because only 2 months left for entrance exam and I still score below 100/300 in mock test when I should be scoring 200+ by now my parents want me to score 250/300 so that I can get admission in best college oh, choices is hidden on my mom's phone. but she knows about it main problem is my brother hates me. so I can't sneak her phone yup and icing on cake is fact you need to be in top 5k/1.3 million test takers wow! cool! I don't feel motivated enough to study these days wanna see how the entrance test here is? https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/WebInfo/Handler/FileHandler.ashx?i=File&ii=42&iii=Y there you go. ignore the other language questions physics, chemistry, maths ikr no essay just MCQs +4 for correct ans, -1 for wrong 0 for not attempting yeah oof! i have never been diagnosed for any disorder or anything like that :OOF: ooh nice! ^ yeah. its better imo I had practical exam for physics, chemistry and CS in school physics was find focal length of lens and find the EMF of battery using potentiometer *for me* it was randomly allocated to everyone chemistry was titration, find cation and anion, find the functional group in organic compound sample CS was create a program that does 'xyz' (pretty sure I got program to bubble sort n numbers) I am done with school but college entrance... ugghh and now a mosquito is buzzing near my ear Ohh! Welcome Back! Afternoon! The usual (plus dad bugging every hour and no mobile) :OOF: F is reminding me of ||Lily|| 😭 and ||Lily|| is reminding me of the fact I can't play choices 😭 also, sorry for not spoiler tagging... I was swept in emotions 😭 :OOF: for your Nintendo and Nox crashes on my laptop the moment I open choices, it crashes *you can use Nintendo DS emulator tho if you want* DeSmume is a good one iirc GBA and DS are the only ones that have properly working emulators 3DS and Switch are still finicky I had to format it last June. Now there is too much data that it will take too much time to backup then format Also, my laptop is 8 years old probably why majority of emulators and other softwares crash This laptop is now only good for discord, web browsing and MS-Office > I downloaded GBA emulator to replay pokemon games

I am excited for it (If only someone from PB was listening to our conversations and would work on making it a reality) I should probably slee 🅱️ but its 5am here. should I just be awake for the whole day? since I have to be up at 8:30 to setup zoom for my brother anyway idk. my brother will definitely wake me up at 8:30am and it would suck to wake up mid sleep :dopeywhat: but I need something to do for 3:15 hours if I will have to wake up till 8:30 I was looking at the number of *public revisions* PB made for any particular chapter and the results were shocking! highest number of revisions made to a particular chapter is 5 and is done in a total of 5 chapters, 4 of which are from BB book 1 and one is MW ch 1 I officially have nothing else to do so Imma sleep I guess Good Night! my brother's class was a disaster today wanna hear about how my brother's 3 classes went? *in detail?* not all classes were on zoom tho yeah, you have it on google hangouts right? zoom has a terrible interface imo I think. never really tried hangouts same I was telling my mom how my brother's school should just shift to discord well yeah but what they can do is teacher screen shares through through streaming and everyne is connected on VC. Children can unmute themselves to ask doubts It will be better than teacher shouting to shut off your webcams yup discord has a lot of features that can help in online class exactly. his english teacher was using zoom and idk why (neither does he) she muted my brother. he wasn't able to ask anything and there was this other girl who would randomly start screeching when the teacher is teaching lol then the second class was sst. the teacher straight up said class will be through youtube live video so that was fun my brother was eating while watching the third class was hindi and the teacher straight up shared an audio where he explained the chapter and shared notes on whatsapp yeah. we laughed at how lazier teachers got with time i get it. thank god I graduated from high school in 2019 yeah *I still think they should move to discord tho* ^ but still they should know about how feature rich it is now my father has to work from home and has to use computer and whatsapp for everything (but he is a ***boomer***) and I am getting tired of telling things like "click on those 9 dots on top right corner" I am starting to hate this lockdown now *because everyone is asking me to help them since I'm the computer girl of my house* lol. good idea nice I never even got pocket money and the money my relatives give (indian customs), I give them back to my parents since I too never needed to have my own money now that I think about it, I used to get a lot of money from my relatives (thanks to all the indian festivals and rituals) I should have saved them instead of giving them to my parents yeah. but I'm dumb lol. it would create a nice argument my parents will then start listing all the things they are providing for my better upbringing and all I am doing is asking my money back y'know MW didn't have a dying customisable MC before. It was just Theresa Holland dying in first scene who was a screenwriter like no choice on gender, name and job this server icon is soo cursed oh hi Mara! when is ch4 releasing? :dopeystarey: oop! 😳 okay. have fun! Hey Benji! Wanna read MW before it got changed? after there is a version no one really knows about aww... it will get better with time... FIRST TIME I GOT SCORE>2000!!! its tentrix! (a little different than tetris). Thanks! :dopeystarey: And, Hey! EnglBaguette! fave book and li? The dp of bartie always throws me to splits 😂 Whosoever idea was that is a genius! i want a robot doggo like aibo because I am irresponsible If I ever had a real dog, he would be so disappointed he would be better off scounging in streets rather than live with me but its true i am worse than that life that is why I will never own a pet might keep a robot tho. less maintenance and it wouldn't leave me maybe something like cozmo Milk time!!! Yummy! The one I showed had Hershey chocolate mix in it And I am forced to drink a glass of milk ( with my favourite flavor tho) every night I am scolded for not drinking water but I don't care (I also sneaked up on my mom's mobile) But idk what to do with it. I don't wanna play trh or OH Ehh... Maybe in sophomore year of college That's when my cousins got their mobile I might tell them to buy me one for my next birthday. Y'know it will be a few months earlier Aww Thankyou This is my phone I don't use it anymore I got it in 11th grade for emergency calling It can run YouTube tho trh, ds, wabr oh Another good screenshot of berry high thankyou! dude why does pb follow 3 instagram accounts of one person? and they follow only one writer, kara good night everyone!!! whatsapp class is utter chaos, zoom class is terrible and youtube live class is... not useful #onlineclassondiscordftw dude, my brother is trying zoom on mobile today and he can't hear anything how do i fix it? any idea it shows call via device audio what does it mean? nvm got it I really feel bad for the teachers now :LMFAOdead: Someone kicked out the teacher himself :LMFAOdead: I am talking about what happened here It happened last week The teacher got back Yeah The teacher was old so people made him believe that his internet is messed up Which was actually true Yeah:LMFAOdead: Hehe True :LMFAOdead: any tips on how to not sleep? coffee? ah i see you are a man of culture 😌 You named yourself from right to left?! all 3 covers are cringey imo let's just keep the current one even though it creeps me out everytime I look at it My mom was watching a korean movie the witch chapter 1. Dude, it was **epic**. Does anyone know when's the sequel coming? lol. me neither. But that movie was really good. you should watch it sometime idk. I personally never liked k-anything tbh. but this movie was really good hard same lilli like there is my third cousin?! or something. she loves bts and shows me every kpop thing like songs and interviews. I personally never got the appeal heh oh yeah, my mom and brother watched parasite and were just about to kill me because the movie was below their expectations :OOF: that person deserved a kick that sounds very weird no one voted for witness lol I played the web version on a game website. I couldn't figure out what to do. All I did was mine till I reached the ocean bed and then I didn't know how to climb up good night! does this work for server icon? aha! found a good one! you mean like this? 35 o.O ooh! second last one is what you are looking for The one with bartie pointing a gun is amazing 😂 ikr Can't poor people like me play VIP books? 🥺 well, you can't *play* VIP books, but I can access them and upload if you want. (shameless promotion for my server) (I will delete this message if the staff wants me to) Huh? Oh I get it But it isn't the same as playing 😕 yeah. but you can see all the assets, what happens when you choose any choice without replaying to see all the possible outcomes Hmm *repetitively click furi's pfp to make it look like he is bobbing his head* good morning Altair! https://discordapp.com/channels/447426832371810305/447581814400221194/695168448983990323 does this qualify for a better server icon? hmm... so you need a shorter one? ok. if you say so... nah. I read some messages and thought you guys didn't like the current one but couldn't find a better one that is why I uploaded the official cover from game files *is that a bad thing?* uh... okay... I have never watched star wars tbh *is it worse than watching || lily/jax die?||* #BringBackBartie wait, TOM HOLLAND IS 21?!!! what the- I thought he was like 15ish but he looks like a teenager Day 7?! (I don't remember) for me. But I didn't go out of my house since feb 29. So, that way its day 32 for me too same I will be home until JEE mains which is estimated to be conducted in last week of may when is it? :OOF: my brother's bday is on may 7th happy belated birthday to your grandma Doge! best of luck lilli my brother thought sst class was gonna be on YT and he overslept. It was on zoom We had booking to visit the president's house! 3 days before the booking, they closed it for public no, of course not! *we missed by 3 days* 😭 and it took me 2 months to get the booking 😢 Who wants to read BOLAS? hmm... okay! heh I want to give you spoilers but I am controlling myself *I know* I play pokemon. does that count? I have played gta vc in the past tho COD in my mind is cod liver oil most that took for me is probably choices no. It gets to like 300ish MB I haven't checked how much HSS Prime takes tho > bruh this 80mb are from when I used to download choices on google play
the apk is still like 70-80mb but it increases when it installs on phone when it unpacks all the stuff Pics on my gallery are mostly my family photos and whatsapp media My (mom's) phone has about 50 gb space after installing android Hey Fallin! > Yes I agree Minecraft is epic fun
@cot my childhood is Minecraft Not that I still don't play Minecraft > How dare you Tera

I am just not feeling sleepy I think imma sleep now. 7:40 here. Goodnight hopefully for real this time! I slept at 7:40 am now my head is hurting so badly its 2pm rn tbh I don't like any Edward. Its uhh... definitely not the best hairstyle. Hispanic one looks decent tho *meanwhile me, a vegetarian - wait, is any of that really edible?* we use cilantro to garnish literally every dish that's not sweet. Me too. but somehow I feel 🤢 when I smell non-veg she is *jabrokie* you guys are forming opinions too early. Although I would definitely do it for da money you guys are overthinking. it was just a prescription I trust Jackie. She would never do anything wrong. ~~she changed at end of book 1 and promised she won't be a jerk anymore~~ I have faith in her I cheated from class 7 till class 10 I only cheated in Hindi and SSt tho because I hate both of those subjects but my cheating was more like asking my friends for answers ~~and passing on the paper so that I write answer I know and they write what they know~~ we were not allowed to take phones to school 2 for me hindi because teacher was wack and syllabus was wackier sst because I hate it We had so many tests that not having one test in a day used to become a surprise for us So cheating was like second hand 😂 I was a KVian so we rarely had tests I see That happens with me too sometimes but not that serious too I have never been stressed to any point My mom is afraid I don't have the stress hormones :shifty: hey zee! how are you? I'm great! just finished reading OH I am only reading it to know who will die too much Ethan these days and I romanced Ethan I mean, it was good at first but now its getting pretty annoying zee! which books are you currently playing? oh. hope you figure out everything and your stress level goes down! Good Night (I guess?!) And I am afraid I will say the same words for Edward in DS Same. Tho I was single in TE Hello. My name is Priyudi! Idk why I did that XD I can't sleep It's 3:30am huh? what happened viv? nah. this server can't delete. *It will have to go over my dead body to get deleted* next to deafen on bottom left, there is a gear icon click that then privacy and safety then allow messages from server members alternatively, you can block particular people like this I am a boomer in certain apps like zoom and reddit that's not true. my dad is boomer at everything *he doesn't even know how to compose an e-mail* yup he says god forgot to insert the computer aptitude chip in his brain his dad (my grandpa) uses fb. My dad doesn't even know what fb is used for and now he has to work from home meaning send e-mails instead of faxes so he tells me to send emails, transfer files from pc to mobile etc Heyo Niko! Fave book and LI? oh! welcome back! *even Witness?* definitely. this book is a cash grab I didn't start playing this book ^ but I read witness in code to see if anything exciting will happen so far its a disappointment thats not a spoiler. it just disappointed till ch whatever is released I know anyways, witness whack also, the cliffhanger in last chapter was something that made me hate this book even more like I don't get it. does cassian want to keep their job or not? one time cassian is all don't come near me or you put my job in jeopardy other time they are like I want MC rn #witness-a-bodyguard-romance Gahhhhh!!!! Reddit is not working I got a desert temple at spawn And this ravine a bit farther Nice How do you enable coordinates? I would build a house like that to honour jax > In mobile you just go to the settings before you make the world and turn coords on
@kaitoo ok thanks F Deforestation Global warming Hole in ozone layer :OOF: I really like the bed for the dog I still don't understand minecraft > I still don't understand minecraft
@Deleted User you build you fight you survive you unleash your imagination > (Yes, I built that)
@MaralinaSakura DAAAAMN This is out of the world ! :OOF: looks great! (and looks like it took a lot of hard work) damn! I never have concentration enough to work on something for a week I just leave them halfway heh. nice! > There’s so many on it but I think I covered it up well enough
@MaralinaSakura that's an understatement of the year Did you make a blueprint for this? not so is live use that ,im Bokura wa Ima no Naka de Umi Sonoda good job notso I see Good night everyone. (Hopefully) Dang! That's a lot of collectibles! Also, I'm glad your dad is back from hospital and is okay. And I am waiting for Ch 4 (no pressure tho) thanks for informing me! And even tho I said good night, I can't sleep. Again! I think part of the reason is that I get to use my mom's mobile after she sleeps And I try to use that opportunity Heh. Good night! Imma play HSS prime now I guess Or DS or OH I just wanna say one word - fukano. Ok bye! I wanna go to Japan but I doubt I will get vegetarian food there I wanna live in those capsule hotels and go to the robo restaurant .ud weeb Ehh okay I liked detective Conan and idaten jump Idaten jump is good and only has like 52 episodes Detective Conan has more than 700 iirc I have only watched first 50 tho Then there was ryukendo which is not anime but still is very good :OOF: lol I can't imagine someone conducting a test in online class I mean, it would have been weird if it wasn't awkward #onlineclassesondiscordftw people be searching about zoom a lot these days and its weird because zoom isn't that good of an app :OOF: I know I'm late but w/e just one line 😞 ~~I took out my graphic tablet just to write those very messy notes on the image~~ was that sarcasm? well, you are the only person to call my handwriting nice. thanks! wait, really? I- OMG Thankyou!!! :dopeystarey: nah. its cute imo (I love cursive writings) heh. mine fluctuates a lot sometimes print, sometimes cursive, sometimes mix heh. yeah, your cursive>normal these are my notes. see how creepy my handwriting gets Viv, you should take some rest. get some sleep! Fluid mechanics, naice fluid mechanics - bleghhh Hehe physics - bleghhh chemistry- bleghhh maths - bleghhh Maths>organic chem>physics>rest of chem CS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>maths>chemistry>physics 👍 I still don't get why do I need to study pcm to get CS in college I dunno why students have to study physics for NEET 🤷‍♂️ I mean how would the concept of transistors come in use when you are doing a heart surgery? Or how would electric field inside a shell come into use when you are a pediatrician 😂 I personally don't like wearing makeup ~~but my mom bought 5000inr worth of makeup for my cousin's wedding so that we don't look *underdressed* among other ladies~~ so, now I feel like that money would go to waste. that is why I wore makeup on both my mom's birthday and my own birthday yeah. that is the sole purpose of discord disguise :OOF: I still have a lot of makeup left. and no events to wear it yeah. I know plenty of people that gain confidence by wearing makeup. But it's just that I am not one of them. My face feels heavy and caked after applying makeup I only apply makeup on events like birthday or ceremonies. too lazy to put makeup everyday/everytime I go out. then there is a problem of skincare. I hardly do anything to take care of my skin ~~mainly because I'm lazy~~. And that way makeup has adverse effects on my skin I do like applying kohl tho I used to live somewhere hot and humid during my tween and teen years back when 
1. there was no makeup in my house except a lipstick
2. I myself wasn't that much interested in makeup I do appreciate people who can put suitable makeup tho. knowing what would suit to a face and the dress is tough. Also, applying them in a way which doesn't look too little or too much is tough I remember my cousin's makeup during her engagement. It looked like the artist didn't know anything about makeup. She was looking darker than usual. Also, the artist focused too much on her already huge eyes. Needless to say, she looked weird ~~guess the artist she hired didn't learn before practicing~~ ooh! nice! my cousin wore a 'lehenga' (indian skirt thingy). Its traditional here. All my other cousins also wore lehenga except me. I wore a western gown sounds cool! do you have any pics you can share here? cool! :OOF: . Ok! DS ch 3 is ||why did you open the tags? 😛 you should know that I will not share spoilers here|| so you opened the tag huh? me too. but then again, ~~I'm the spoiler lover~~ now I have just changed the setting to show me spoilers everytime w/o clicking on them The name sounds middle Eastern though There's a European side of turkey and a middle Eastern side I never really understood the conflict regarding Palestine 👍 this is a golden meme Too much history! The only way history was taught in my school was by mugging up 🥺 That is why I have an aversion towards history It means to memorize everything rote learning Innocent children had to memorize so much 🥺 Innocent kids like me And others 🥺 > rote learning
@Deleted User yeah this was the word I was searching for As far as I remember in my final year of history we were taught a bit of European history, Vietnam USA war and the rest is Indian history 🤔 Feel bad for Einstein Pasta Was this someone's name or were many people actually typing Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Hope you all are washing your hands with soap :pleb: Tbh I have washed my hands with soap more times in these few days of lockdown than my entire life 😂 😂 https://media.tenor.com/images/85ecb6d9132f695d7cc4cde51772e1b4/tenor.gif Indeed I see you are a man of culture 😌 I just used H2O before this > how can you clean your hand just with just water and say you're ready...
@oge no this was before this epidemic broke out Well yeah.. but.. I never use soap to wash hands I used to wash hands before eating but with water ...I use liquid hand wash instead My mom forces me so now it's kind of a habit Same Indeed Well yes but no I always used to feel lazy washing hands for 2 full minutes 🤷‍♂️ That's a good track record you got there 😂 Weird how prince Charles got cured but Boris Johnson's situation has worsened Prince Charles never got to be king Yeah No offense but I think Elizabeth will outlive him You need to get past the royal guards for that I guess Why is trump behind this hydroxychloroquine.. :OOF: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-cure-fact-check-hydroxychloroquine-trump Found something at last kinda late but... welcome to da gang sef! good night! Am I mean? thankyou. but someone called me mean and I am not feeling good now I just told them not to ping me for no reason like I barely go to that server, and suddenly I get pinged 4-5 times and those aren't @ everyone pings/role pings 😮 that's mean And you know why was I pinged? They used some 'slutbot' to 'rob' me the bot's currency I never heard the bot's name before today So, I went in and asked why was I pinged, they said cause you have been robbed. I was like I don't care about being robbed. Just please don't ping me. And then one of them was like - I didn't ping you, why are you so rude. I said I meant it in a general sense and was not pointing at you (mind you that they were pinging me everytime they wanted to point a message at me) And then they were like- monitor your own settings instead of yelling. (I have that server muted and role/everyone pings suppressed since jan 2020 🤦🏻 ) I just wanted to let it all out *still can't believe there is a bot named 'slutbot'* I am bored. what should I do? *boring* choices book or *book* book hmm... no interesting titles around oh. I know sex ed is on netflix. never dared to watch ~~because asian parents~~ I am 19 but I can't let my parents find out that I watch such serials even if its good I have never heard of Euphoria is it on netflix? then? 👀 oh thats why my mom didn't allow me to book tickets for deadpool she always reads reviews before watching hollywood movies because we have an 11 yr old kid who asks questions without thinking anything like once we went to a movie and that had the cop investigate a rape case and my brother straight up asked what is rape in the theatre It was awkward both for my mom and me he was like 8 or 9 back then he now knows rape is something where a boy does 'really bad things' to a girl I asked what blue films were when we had a rumour (idk if it was true) that a guy from my class watches them in 7th grade basically other word for porn videos I don't plan to drink/smoke ever in my life My dad never smoked or drank so... I have never seen alcohol irl tbh because no one I know drinks/smokes and my dad's collegues drink in parties but I never go there I have seen random people smoke on street tho Its funny because my dad gets allowance from his office to buy alcohol Fun fact : My dad doesn't know the difference between wine and vodka or literally any alcohol My school was pretty strict in that matter yeah. we had many teachers who would be like X, out of my class or I'll not teach and some kids were like, why don't you go out of the class doesn't mean you blackmail the whole class I was once out of the class because I forgot to bring my notebook in 4th grade My only time My school has more than 1300 branches I was only kicked once in 4th grade I bunked class like 6-7 times same we had those in my school I was the part time sketcher, part time singer, part time copying machine, most time back bencher (because I was tall and had to sit in the back) gossiping machine for once, part time class bunkers. like each of these traits were like an era for me I hated being the back bencher. Like once my school started rotations and everyone would complain when it was my turn to sit in the front. the teacher made me and one other girl sit in the back permanently while rest of the class followed rotations then in 10th grade I got fed up. I shifted a single chair and desk to the corner front and became the bully. I told everyone who had any problem - "suck it up" we never had any lgbtq cases in school. none that i know of when is easter? oh who is patient 31? 😎 I agree with doge here I think it was the family who came back from italy and threw a huge bday party My dad can cook food thats either barely edible or is very tasty but very unhealthy at the same time My mom makes the best food I have ever eaten ~~She also likes finding alternatives to food we can't eat~~ like finding alternatives to food that has egg/chilly in them like redfield? o.O no, i meant like how redfield *gave* gifts Wth.. o.O Interesting... Something similar happened with my grandfather around 1950s 😨 same drew There used to be a lake in his town where people used to wash clothes and he knew many people there but once he was returning home pretty late at night around 1 am and he saw a woman in white sari washing clothes at the lake, he had never seen her before and from the next day he never saw that woman again.. Hmm I would never want to sense any spirits tbh it creepy Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Hope you guys used protection.. viv doen't have it either but she is admin so... where? o I realized that after I posted the pic 😛 :OOF: Haven't had sex for like 17 years 😏 Yeah wheres nsfw 2001 Good night! (I guess?!) Good night Niko! #onlineclassesondiscordftw discord upped it to 50 so make a class server i was talking about create a server then 50 peeps can go live meaning they can show their faces I don't think its necessary and discord will make zoom+whatsapp/file sharing app into one I have a Huion something tab ~~krita~~ hiya yukki! I didn't realize you joined today 🤦🏻 because invisible = power Paige and it looks cool There are online courses of Java c++ html etc on YouTube ? The videos on YouTube are pretty informative 😂 I was never able to use YouTube while studying because my parents would think that I would play games on the mobile instead of studying 😂 I used to watch during my free time Hmm Is it like a compulsory subject? Hmmm Sorry to hear that Yeah exactly Try meditation Meditation helps Try avoiding them? I am stuck somewhere in the middle of school and college 🤦‍♀️ What about talking to your mom about getting bullied? This is pretty much a criminal offence.. > Also my mom will still get mad at me about the bullying thing
@YukkiMons but you are not to be blamed for that right? Just being realistic here but I think it would be a hard job convincing the police I can't sleep And I was kicked out of my bed so I am pulling an all nighter. figuratively kicked out by my brother yep he wasn't allowing me turn the fan on and I was sweating so he said and I quote (translated of course) "If you feel hot, get out of this room and sleep somewhere else" I know 😔 :OOF: my mom said - his immunity is weak, he'll catch cold and due to the pandemic, we won't be in a state to take him to the doctors so the fan will remain off also, why aren't you sleeping TeraBaap? Are you pulling an all nighter too? I am somewhat of a night owl hard same. but my mom forces me to sleep at night most of the time When I was in school even my mom used to force were you in KV? No Dps o rich kid huh jk Eh 🤷‍♂️ Which state are you from? I travel all over India Nice 👍 perks of being a daughter of someone with transferable job I see we were supposed to transfer in end of may but we are not so sure now 😔 So where do you live now?

I mean, I am starting to get more of these since the last year then I see a black van going and I realize that my brother is kidnapped so I ask the good brother about where did he come from and I think they forgot to hide their identity in his memories so he just says I came from Eros Factory which is in next street And then I do the most selfish thing. I say - "I don't care about him. I like you and will keep you." and then he's like yay! I love you too! and then I wake up only to find my brother screaming at me *It was good while it lasted* ~~I mean, I am selfish enough to do that irl too~~ wait really? Owo idk.

I won't play witness until vip mod releases it doesn't give unlimited diamonds per se it just makes premium scenes free they don't these days ye I remember spending on closet and then sort of diamond mining for that text scene in hss i just needed 4 diamonds so it wasn't a huge deal nope. what is it? o.O so its about an Indian girl also, Idk anything about thicc arm hair being a thing here Good night everyone! that is my city in the picture that's the India Gate (I went there twice) My dad's office is walkable distance from there its w/e tbh. I was never the 'historic places are nice' type of girl But yeah, my city does have a lot of pollution its mostly exxagerated. the before pic is from the time when lots of burning and pollution friendly takes place. we do see clear skies during summers Hey Viv! Whassup! Hey greenbriars! Fave book and LI (if you don't mind) ~~pikachu~~ You should draw whatever you feel like drawing. I hope you feel better after drawing! 😃 the character on paige's pfp so, there is this skribbl.io alternative called pinturillo 2 (paige and doge know about it). I found it last year. So, I used to play every night and found a group of people who came online at that time daily and used to chat in the lobby. I went with the name of priyudi and had nice talk with them. then someone asked me if I was a guy. I asked, what do you think? they said my name looks like that of a guy. so I played along. Now, everyone there knows I am a 17 year old guy. One day I accidently nicknamed myself pari. And in the lobby Idk how but I mentioned that I know Priyudi. And that's when my devious mind had an idea. The idea was to roleplay as both priyudi and pari whose parents are close friends. Priyudi is 17 yr old guy and pari is 5 year old girl. So, I opened a new tab and logged by the name of Priyudi and wrote sth like what are you doing here pari, you are not supposed to be here before 13 years blah blah blah, I (pari) was reacting with  stuff like why not, I wanna stay here etc. That's when someone mentioned about their breakup in chat. I made pari (who is 5 years old) question what is breakup and priyudi telling her to go offline. ~~I created a ruckus in chat~~ Othrs were also supporting priyudi. Finally I made them feel pari's parents caught her and banned her from using computer. then I don't really remember what exactly happened but I think I made Priyudi grounded because he told pari about the game. It was chaotic, my story had several loop holes but nobody really questioned them so 🤷🏻 . It was fun to rp as 2 entirely different persons. 😈 ~~I may or may not have done something similar on discord~~ 😬 Idk why I did it. But I had fun doing it do we still have that meme? https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447581814400221194/694281361363566643/Screenshot_2020-03-30_at_1.26.02_PM.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/447581814400221194/694283697570054164/Screenshot_2020-03-30_at_1.35.17_PM.png really? did you find mine? ~~I never open my fb account~~ the last time I was on fb was when I opened it to accept my then newly wed aunt's friend request which was 2016 I never thought of downloading tiktok same I don't get the appeal tbh what is kahoot?

Those were good times at least I was able to clear the first warp zone tho I sleep at 8am and wake up at 4pm :OOF: my mom doesn't disturb me from sleep most of the time ^ :OOF: I eat twice (since I was like 8 years old) maybe 1 person should add all the emojis then remove once some one has voted 🙁 me edward sprites? but they are headless get from ally's ig account she has all the sprites hol up lemme find https://www.instagram.com/p/B-i_FBHFDku/ I can edit all the edwards but I need time like 4 hours I can give you the game files tho rn with the headless sprites alright! if you say so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ carole who? wut 1M $ jk my dad's income is around 1.1k $ a month (after deducting taxes) And I consider myself in the upper middle class i can vote for black edward so that you can vote, then I'll unvote i did it I'm kinda feeling bad for hispanic edward now so maybe I'll vote him instead of oliver since we all know oliver is not gonna win 😔 try voting for him now indeed now I'm feeling bad for oliver too sorry but maybe I will give my vote to oliver same. but he looks cute and doesn't deserve only one vote ~~also, I didn't really like edward and charlie so far~~ yeah yeah. also, he looks better than all the edwards imo its in #robo-lab-bots doge also didn't see oliver until today idc if he gets immy treatment tho. he should just not get raf treatment raf was also introduced very late in book immy treatment is better than raf treatment raf literally friendzoned all the MCs that romanced him lol https://tenor.com/view/gorillaz-mv-all-in-your-head-clint-eastwood-its-all-in-your-head-gif-7541556 blackberry 😳 😬 yes you are ^ and that's after she has an MBA *please timezones, make it so that I'll be sleeping when that happens* I would come in VC after the quarantine is over > you say that as you have a normal sleep schedule to begin with

Welcome to da cult! awww, hi! How are you? a bit overwhelmed
I'm a recent player, and after I caught up with OH2, I decided to just dive into discord and subreddit lol. I actually found out about the fandom after like 1 year of playing that must've been fun!
I've been in fandoms before I started playing Choices, so "there should definitely be a fandom" was a first thought
pity I can't write fics though, all this burn needs an outlet :D oh! ~~I'm a boomer XD~~ I mean, you can write a short story style fiction. Paige did it once and it was amazing it's just I'm Belarusian and English is not my first, so commenting at reddit is pretty much my skill limit :D English is not my first language either. I have to take a second translating w/e I want to say What have you named it? has anyone noticed how some bots have a tick mark next to them? is it some kind of verified bot thing? hmm... are you not playing bolas? o.0 Good night! do you have sth like this? bottom right what keyboard do you have on your phone? nah. that screen was from PC its possible to send gifs through GBoard was it on bottom right? or did you use GBoard? ahh! I never used that keyboard but I know the gif option is in GBoard ~~also, you can run a quick google search in GBoard w/o opening browser~~ Good Night @every one solitaire>uno I didn't even hear about clue until today monoply is looooong ~~still never heard of it~~ I have monopoly with the machine that does all the calculation of money I have monopoly, and 3 sets of uno. And I also have plenty of cards monopoly is long. its the reason why its in the shelf for like 5 months we got it last year on my brother's birthday we played like 5 games in that week. then once during diwali holidays that's it ludo I don't remember the last time I played ludo yeah. ludo is just ludo no murder involved ~~It was also called "chausar" during the Mahabharata times~~ to think that a war happened because of a ludo game oo we used to call it chausar. well its slightly different than the present day ludo but still... (I feel its the same) its actually a game with great history yup have you heard of Mahabharata? its an Indian mythology the great war of mahabharata Its a long saga but tldr - 106 cousins (and some other people) fight because of ludo I made a jax emote! ~~Its a screenshot because I don't have nitro~~ this is doge who loves spoilers XD its a very common emote. y'know, I didn't know doge was actually a meme before @ Doge pointed out himself. Now I was searching for doge emotes and the results are making me laugh so hard rn because I am trying to imagine @ Doge in those emotes if that makes any sense Imagine oh how I wish I had nitro the doge one? yeah aha! ~~mine is bigger than yours!~~ regarless of everything tho, lilli Its gonna be 6 o'clock! oop! guess I should sleep! Good night Hyper! and good luck with your It lives in the interim! Hey Ella! Welcome back! So, How are you doin'? I'm great as usual! 😄 our national language is hindi but official works carry out in both hindi and english so kinda ehh... some are... some are not I haven't watched like both english and hindi versions of all the hollywood movies but the hindi ones makes sense most of the time songs are never translated properly. like I always feel the original songs are better than the dubbed ones. I haven't watched jungle book ever so lemme see both versions rq before giving my opinions ok. I listened the hindi one and its about the bear telling mowgli that our heart needs very little to feel satisfied. Then he shows ways to satisfy the heart like getting food and scratching backs. For food the bear first warns that some may have thorns that you shouldn't eat but then he is like why go for the thorny fruits when you can have a huge and tasty papaya. I can give line by line translation if you want but that's what I understood from the song. Idk how far off I am from the original song I know the translation of that one frozen 2 song (the lullaby that kinda gave away the story) was poor. and not that effective yeah in hindi it was "apne dil ko bas thoda hi to chahiye" idk ~~there is a walkthrough on my server~~ but yeah you win/lose based on your choices I don't remember tbh but I think you win if you took the practice diamond choice yeah. english to hindi translation is actually decent. south indian languages to hindi translations is 😨 @DaHomieDrew did you notice this? I too noticed it 30 minutes ago desktop 7 hiatus and no upcoming standard of living varies greatly from city to city. Where I used to live earlier, groceries used to be cheaper than where I am living currently. It also shows from the fact most people in US have iphones but in india, most people have budget smartphones as much as it comes down to the person's dedication to buy something, comparison with other things also play a huge part like here, amazon prime gives me most of the shows and movies for rs. 129 a month whereas netflix gives me the same library plus some original titles I may or may not be interested in for 600 a month So, it makes me want to compare netflix and amazon prime video and ultimately choose amazon subscription 'cause its cheaper it does factor in a way like I earn xx amount. can I spend y amount on entertainment? how much will it impact on my budget for essentials like groceries and bills also, me saying VIP is expensive is because 'expensive' is a relative word. meaning I compared it with other stuff and found it expensive I mean anyone earning more than 1700 indian rupees a month can purchase VIP duh thing is when companies set a price for anything, they HAVE to consider will an average person buy it PB is just shooting their own foot by only thinking about rich countries ~~this wasn't a debate~~ Anyways, I don't listen to BTS or KPOP but thanks for the warning Raven! ~~go try~~ no please don't same hat Drew o that reminds me! now that zoom isn't considered safe, my brother's school shifted to microsoft teams for online school and now we have office 365 for free isn't snapchat the thing where there are trr filters? tbh I have never used snapchat reee... I know I'm a boomer! good night everyone! This boomer needs some sleep XD What's that? Cool Looks cool But I guess I will stick with my original dp 👍 nice! quarantine made you learn a skill! good job viv! idk any of these people ~~I don't watch that many hollywood movies or shows~~ I mean I know these shows exist. but I never watched any of them ikr. how are we supposed to know the quiz is correct if we don't know who the characters are someone used that template for a choices meme too it was like book 3 = wedding book tbh only book 3 that doesn't have a wedding scene is HSS and HSSCA ES and TCTF though not entirely wedding books still had wedding chapters/scenes oh yeah. forgot about that ~~it did mention a wedding in epilogue through a choice but I get your point~~ totally not a copy of umg 🤦 that video is from 2007 XD looks like they changed it :LMFAOdead: ~~are they secretly making androids that would replace all the actors?~~ Well there goes the oil prices Govt shall pay us to buy oil :OOF: yeah. it definitely has some benefits > And don’t even get me started on the recovering environment (:
@DaHomieDrew well river water here has become fit for drinking so yeah Hello Ty 💕 Hmmmm Bloudbound, mother of the year , open heart *blood :)( Levi Or Bryce @Ne-Rwby-On ty 💕 Wbu Yes Of course :)) I’m reading that currently I just need more diamonds Yes ooh! nice!

I hope you never have to deal with heartbreaks! 😄 engagement isn't bad if you get to have access to unlimited cuddles also cuddles>>>>>>>>>>>other forms of showing love and yes threep is my spirit animal aww! when is it tho? oh!

I only have a teddy to cuddle 😒 . A human would definitely be nice I hope so. ~~I am 19~~ lol. who knows But quarantine might mess things up Also, tbh at first I thought it was your brother in your pfp me too! thanks! good different I hope whoa whoa whoa!! that's not what I was expecting but weirdly, I can relate I have a brother who hates me too ~~though he is 10 years old and never accused me of murder luckily~~ :OOF: I am sorry to hear that. atleast its cool that he liberated himself so you don't have to worry about him anymore also, I do hope my brother starts liking me. Happens to me sometimes ehh no offence but curd>yoghurt PB teased there will be one release next month https://twitter.com/playchoices/status/1252311974190309376?s=21 Viv! ~~you are late to the party~~ this was like 2 days ago. Well, what happened was someone who knew kezz's method leaked the protobins of OH ch 8 3 days before release publicly on instagram. People complained to PB abd PB had to issue the warning I only release spoilers on my server, here and in feenie's server I was surprised? yes. But I was surprised at the dumbness of that person like what were they thinking also, I don't have the screen but PB said they will have updates for us "hopefully by the end of this week" new book perhaps PB definitely knows about the mod but since no one is complaining and they are not having that much loss, they don't talk about it My mom used to have a samsung but it was bad. started crashing after 2 years then we got lenovo that lasted 3 years now we have realme lenovo was good The HSS prime pics I posted were from lenovo well, headphone jack is removed for a variety of reasons like making space for components, making the phone slimmer, sometimes giving it protection from dust and water etc. but you do want that 5000mah battery right? thank god the headphone jack hasn't been removed in budget smartphones iirc, don't the samsung phones that don't have headphone jack come with galaxy buds? 🤦 internet is weird sometimes me neither I think the one with more upvotes is sfw but I can be wrong ~~wish I could unsee that~~ Have any of you gone into the dark web? ||Where all illegal stuff happens like organ selling and they upload videos of murders beheading abuse etc|| Nice Me neither ||The max I have seen is an unclear video of child abuse which went viral in the internet|| I see ||that video is still there|| Looks like the curve has started flattening in Spain and Italy The virus I've heard protests are still on in US But even if there is natural selection the lives of thousands of other people are in danger Pretty horrifying how a virus which originated in the small town of Wuhan spread to almost each and every corner of the world My bad virus? what virus? XD I am. lol My brother is ready to write a story titled "The mastermind behind coronavirus" We have about 18k cases I believe but testing isn't rigorous here :OOF: ! stay safe everyone! ight. I gotta sleep now or else my mom will spank me Good night! :OOF: zoom is wack my brother's school switched to microsoft teams because zoom has privacy issues :OOF: why did the professor asked the students to turn on camera in first place? 🤔 Yeah for us we switch off the camera And we unmute the mic only if we have a doubt Hey @arya !

You are too precious to waste your energy on such people Heh. You wouldn't want to get notifications of every single message tho ~~speaking from personal experience~~ Yeah. Ella! Maybe you can help hyper out with his game Hyper... Wanna explain? Cause you know it much better than I do lol Also, sorry I can't help you hyper. It's just that idk much about your game, the 2 chapters I read didn't interest me (sorry!) Also idk what I can do to help incase of stories. I do try to help you when you post your art tho Also, Ella, you should totally play It lives. It's amazing! ~~especially at night with sound on and lights off~~ Also, I don't really think hyper's game needs you to know the story of It lives since he is kinda remaking it from scratch Yeah 😅 ~~if you have a little time tho, I could totally use your help in #choices-chat~~ Hey 7-11! Wanna help me? ~~yes I am desperate~~ With IRIS I kinda made a discord bot inspired by kezz's IRIS But idk what commands should I create for her 🥺 pretty please! The list of commands it already has is in #choices-chat Thanks! But idk what else to add Since I am planning to invite it to other choices servers as well I can maybe add description of every book along with its release date I guess?! But idk if it'll be of any use Like you search /BB and IRIS tells you a synopsis and release date of BB Thankyou! 🤗 Should I add the synopsis thing tho Ehh... To me, yes 7-11 :bigmood: After Kim Jong un will it be Kim Jong duo? Yeah @oge you are dreaming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWdN1afV_x4 I had to listen it every time I went to watch a movie in a theatre. Naaice 👍 oh boy! this reminds me of my dad's office anthem. I remember one of the first things I searched on internet was my dad's office and an anthem popped up. I downloaded it and used to play it numerous times till I got all the lyrics by heart. then we shifted houses and I forgot about this song. last month I was told my dad's office committee will give me a certificate for scoring well in 12th grade finals. The entire program was boring but at one point they played that anthem and idk why (maybe nostalgia) I was laughing. like everyone else were feeling proud (or bored) listening to that anthem and I was 🤭 . That was the only interesting part of that function :aww: Hey @Annabelle 🐳 ! What's your favourite book and LI? > After Kim Jong un will it be Kim Jong duo?
Kim Jong un has a sister named kim yo Jung and tbh she looks even more dangerous than Kim Jong un 😨 Yeah maybe its good for the people if he remains alive because she does not look convincing at all Hey Paige! Welcome back! Good to see you again! ~~I missed you UwU~~ lol. 👋 indeed. quinn is such a cutie :dopeywhat: ~~imagine nia in a sex game~~ 😳 ikr when Mal was looking at those books in library, nia was like "I know what... I know how babies are made" and Mal was like "lol. she can't even say it" threep is me who was once upon a time a very reputed cat and is now only one of its species left yeah. ,im mighty cat masked niyander this? @Tyr sorry for the ping but can you give @( ˶ᵔ༝ᵔ˶) milquetoast ♡ the 17+ role? oop! sorry! 😬 I think its cause mature content in games indicate 17+ ~~also, 1 year doesn't really make any difference~~ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ lol thanks furi! witness is definitely not 12+ even w/o diamond scenes ~~but you aren't middle schooler~~ 👀  jk 25% at day, minimum at night with yellow tint on > I use blue light filter
you call it blue light filter, I call it the yellow tint XD my parent's phone also has dark mode but they don't like it yeah. I switch to dark mode everytime I use their phone it makes the screen yellowish so it is easy on eyes I use it at night > Am I the only one who's just bored lmao
Bold of you to assume that But I am working on IRIS 2.0 to get rid of boredom same 😱 why does it exist? Don't be. I turned 19 last month *and am still the same* And the black tee I am wearing is from 2015 or 16 Its my favourite. very comfy hmm... for some reason, I hate tank tops I like half sleeves as the minimum But then I hate those "upto wrist" type of full sleeves cause they feel suffocating same we have hot winds during summer but the occasional rain and not having to go outside is making me wear 3/4th sleeves and jeggings last year was pretty rad here as well like you don't sweat as much here but the hot winds make you feel sick oh boy. I remember my dad turning on the AC and waiting outside for 5 minutes before entering the car I mean, that's hyperbole but w/e. yeah last summer was really hot heat is worse for me since I would rather wear several layers I haven't experienced temps below like 4 degree Celsius apart from that one time when I went to a snow park to play the snow park was like a giant refrigerator at -5 degree celsius :OOF: that must be bad thank god I never had to experience it :OOF: *hail storm?* I have seen hail like 3 times in my life ~~all in the past 2 years~~ it used to be above 40C here by now but this year like today, its just 29C and it was 26C two days ago Where I used to live 3 years ago, the coldest it got was like 17C and the warmest it got was like 38-39ishC I loved goa nice weather, calm people, lots of beaches Goa is pretty good it is the best! I have never visited Goa though 😅 Just heard and saw vlogs of it Witness will release later today Bolas on wedneday/thursday yeah 'cause PB is having problems putting up the descriptions https://twitter.com/PlayChoices/status/1254826004620513280 Good night guys! Well, we can't get best of both worlds now can we Ehh Demi and Ari have talent but even I don't like their personalities I never watched Nickelodeon while growing up so idk what y'all are talkin about 🤷 Good night ( for real this time) it's 3:40 am and I should probably sleep. Can we go on with having bartie back with a gun :LMFAOdead: yeah Indeed Greatest :eyez: :shifty: I like where this is going :aww: Hehe https://media.tenor.com/images/b6889466cb42caee48c0695d6380cbf5/tenor.gif you mean the water gun? really? I don't really remember seeing a real gun XD oh oh How you plan on beating that huh? Good night guys! see you in a couple of hours! > Just try me
@oge no 👀 Hehe Nope Rip 😭 🙏 oof! RIP. Its so sad and the fact his mom died on 25th april 2020 the last movie I watched was English Medium (Irrfan's last movie) 😭 i watched karvaan 😭 i never felt sad for any actor/actress passing but for some reason i feel really bad with irrfan gone 😭 yeah. he was a good actor mastered both hollywood and bollywood 😔 me too 2020 is the worst 😖 I am going trh 2 if it means having bartie ahh! a breath of fresh air! thanks Altair! ~~I hope Nia wins the LI poll~~ oh!

Hey! How are you? I can... But I can't see your messages for some reason Hold on lemme check yeah. everything is fine. How about you? is your homework complete? :OOF: sure! thanks! ~~and you aren't annoying me~~ I will be free in about an hour I think alright! good luck with your homework coming from #choices-chat ... many mythological stories had the premise of devils doing tapas for a specific god and god having to grant them a wish as a prize of their tapas. Then the devils would use that prize for evil and gods would have to find loop holes to end them once and for all @azula  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYdnio37CAQ I recommend you this movie. It is about Indian mythology of 10 forms of Lord Krishna in a not so boring way. ~~It was one of my favourite movies as a kid~~ and this one though divided in parts, has english subtitles if you do come to India, come to my home. I will introduce you to the fun aspects of India there are so many varieties of Indian curry like you will get tired trying them all. ooh! I am currently in Delhi why? 1. Heat - Try Kashmir! So chill all year. 
2. people - Try Goa! Less population density
3. Plague - I never heard anyone have it now a days Every Indian Animation has some value hidden in it. That is why majority of animated movies are based on Indian mythology and even the shows have the character teaching some sort of morals to kids lol. but like not every inch and corner of India is like that We have a lot of variety. ehh we do have our demerits but hey! we have soo much variety! that's gotta account for something right? We all talk about America being dumb for asking to open beaches and salons where Indians are also being dumb by grouping because of religion for example the nizammudin meeting of muslims and the maharashtra meeting of sikhs then we have the workers asking to go to their home states after lockdown :OOF: its true tho. I can't sugarcoat and tell we are right all the time right? Yes I was :OOF: ing on the religious gatherings hmm... This coronavirus would have been controlled if these people abided by the rules > hmm... This coronavirus would have been controlled if these people abided by the rules
@Deleted User ~~if they hadn't escaped to different pockets of the country~~ Politics in India is also pretty much screwed. The Opposition never allows good things to happen (and I am not talking about a specific party but the opposition in general) Like we have more than 750 political parties. Meaning 750+ opinions. Decision making is really hard this way ^ Literally any rook or crook can form a party 🤦 *looks at aam admi party* XD @azula  if you have guts you should try bhut jolokia ~~I personally hate spicy food~~ I love spicy food!! But I surely can't eat bhut jolokia with curry and roti :LMFAOdead: Even though majority of Indian cuisine involves chillies, I avoid them Curries at my home never has chilly as ingredient :OOF: ehh... tbh its good that I don't eat chilly. gives variety of digestive problems 🤔 You hate spicy food in the sense you can't handle the spice? Or you just don't find it tasty? both actually I see meaning you will love food at my house Oh I see Then don't try it I can feel the spiciness by just looking at it Indeed nope hold on. lemme try a different method yes but they won't say anything they know but would act like not knowing there is even one called journeys right? is that app good? oh I remember someone talking about an app moments too > https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnaGameProjects/comments/fmlkx6/dev_log_heres_a_huge_update/
@leitgo65  that's Zak's game! oh you might not know him. he is my friend. he is on the wikia and spoiler server no. he is one of the writers there he is writing shades of qualm Good night guys! see you tomorrow! or today XD its 6am here XD I will. Happy Birthday @Catherine !! Hope you have a great birthday today! Its @kaitoo 's Birthday. Its 2am in her timezone. Anyways, Happy birthday Paige also, Paige is the youngest member here XD I could help ~~I can't help with iphones either~~ wasn't the role for "people who can help" and anyone who *needs* help can ping that role? so, shouldn't the channel be open for everyone yeah. I can create a step by step guide that can be pinned in #tech-channel  tho. for downloading mod apk and if people have doubts after reading that/some other queries, they can ask there ~~maybe like a faq doc pinned so that same questions aren't asked again and again~~ what do you think @azula yeah. so, should I start making guide to install mod apk of choices? not at all! I will start working on right away! thanks! YAY!!! Hi Paige!!!! Happy Birthday!!! 751 pings in one group chat I- *751* is a lot @kaitoo HBD! zee is south asian? isn't she australian? and yeah. TeraBaap is from India and Black Scepter is partly Indian Chirusmilex is also part Indian choiceskaavya is also Indian sure! I have heard but never watched it was one of those shows on Cartoon Network that came after 11pm lol. lemme see. ~~honestly never heard of apu before XD~~ hmm... honestly it depends on how much "joke" a person can handle about themselves if that makes sense. I kinda find it offensive. Like I would give you the example of choices characters that are Indian. I hate em all. Why? Because PB didn't do enough research on India but decided to make Indian characters I have ranted about it (PB not researching about India) on my server during my 2 cents on HSSCA2 lol. but if you can't research on India, then don't make Indian characters as simple as that yet they are making books about babies. they shouldn't be writing stuff they haven't properly researched on like every indian is a darker shade of brown Ajay and his family we have much more diversity than any other country, yet we are bound to see ourselves in one stereotypical character mostly by looks but also, as the simpson video you showed mentioned, by accents then there's clothing, language we have so many hindi accents and so many other languages yet we only see other people thinking of that one "funny" accent when we tell them to imagine Indians Like many people still think "Indian" is a language smh Priya... is a very common name ehh... tbf our official language is english, national language is hindi and we have 22 main languages and various other sub-languages yeah. that's true. we learn English from a very young age along with our mother tongue. Majority of children also go to english medium school exactly Its just that the best part about India is diversity. If you are representing India using only a single person with stereotypical features, people are bound to get mad ooh! yeah arrange marriages are pretty common here ^ its never without consent tbh its just that you don't get to know your spouse before marriage I personally support arrange marriages because I feel like our parents have much experience and prevent us from making reckless decisions. Most of time, the bride has to live with the groom's family. So, the parents check the family background before marriage. and that's a good thing since marriage in Hindu religion is basically union of 2 *families*, parents do a better job than kids in choosing those *families* there are demerits of arrange marriage too but similarly there are demerits of love marriage too ^ like western kids are independent when they are 18 ^ hmm... now that's a personal observation. Its all about that prioritizing individual vs family thing everything has its own merits and demerits :OOF: ~~my parents and I don't want me to get married~~ lol. yeah. tho reason for not making me marry is quite different my grandma saw a boy for me when I was 15 smh 3 of those are characters in choices no wait, 4 oof! common girl names in India
Priya
Anjali
Simran
Tara tara means star in hindi ~~idk what green tara is tbh~~ ooh! tbh idk much about Buddhism apart from the fact that buddha was an incarnation of Lord Vishnu yeah basically there is this movie called PK where the protagonist questions religion its a fun movie and makes a lot of sense hmm... interesting hmm.. alright who? the protagonist of life of pi? ohh nice PK is about a curious alien coming to earth and his remote through which he can call his people is stolen. While searching for it, he is told about god and that starts the whole mess of religion ooh! I can recommend some really nice ones 3 idiots is so relatable to students even today. It had a darker and deeper message beneath that comedy premise yeah its interesting yeah caught the beauty of india perfectly I will watch it with you after my exams are over https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p92YbtfeI58 this music video is from a movie and has like 31 famous actors and actresses it set a record of having most superstars in one music video ~~its always fun to recognise every single one of them XD~~ mostly 90% soap operas here are dumb that's real 😔 Indian soap operas make me question life 😂 ^ ikr I saw one in which a lady fell from from the stairs, 2 episodes later she was still falling that's hyperbole TeraBaap :LMFAOdead: you are exaggerating I don't remember the name the videos are real tho idk. haven't watched many soap operas tbh but its possible @azula  see the one in which a lady washes a laptop and hangs it on a clothe liner to dry it 😂 omg that's golden XDDD :LMFAOdead: was it rawknee that has videos on soap operas? @Deleted User @azula you should stick to bollywood movies (good ones) for now XD In Indian soap operas if someone in the family gets slapped they will show the reactions of every single family member ( won't be surprised if they show the reaction of a dog also) that also twice 😂 yeah > was it rawknee that has videos on soap operas? @Deleted User
@Deleted User I dunno hmm... I remember watching an iconic video where someone reacts to soap operas You need to reach another level of intelligence to understand Indian soap operas > hmm... I remember watching an iconic video where someone reacts to soap operas
@Deleted User PewDiePie reacted 🤣 🤣 🤣 What was that a nerf gun? 😂 > @Deleted User PewDiePie reacted
no I am talking about some Indian YTber reacting also, that fight was 🤦 @Deleted User  did you see that serial in which a gorilla kidnaps the lady? I wouldn't be surprised if Indian soap operas had a scene like that Viv! No, I didn't but I know it exists (pretty sure it was thapki) I have seen it in that meme video The gorilla barges into the bedroom and takes the girl 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aJREBJZXDQ i was talking about this video (too bad no subtitles) :LMFAOdead: @Deleted User the gorilla one was reacted by carryminati hmm 🤦‍♀️ ~~I have watched too many videos of soap operas being roasted~~ ~~in India mostly old people watch soap operas~~ > but we have more turkish soaps than indian soaps
@oge I think Turkish ones are better Hmm we do have a turkish soap channel right? XD Yeah? zindagi I think I get recommendations for Turkish soap operas on FB My mom used to watch turkish soaps on that channel There's one in which a guy was attracted to a girl waitress ever since we got fire tv stick, no one in my family watches soap operas They both made eye contact and boom I used to watch soap operas as a kid since my mom used to watch them. Have any of you seen Lilli Singh's video of her parents go to a sex therapist 😂 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewFiQVw-IkY why hasn't tvf put subtitles in this video smh lol. yeah https://youtu.be/Ds2HHhgedIM Doge, imagine a show about a girl being married off to a rich household and after several episodes it becomes a show about dealing with supernatural entities https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasural_Simar_Ka weird shit has gone in this show and I don't recognise the people on cover because the protagonists were different when I used to watch it lol. I'm sure you'll write a smutty romance with plot ^ so, you can't do it even if you completed 1 chap a day whatif the chapters are short like wabr? 2 chaps a day sounds decent then :OOF: but they said plot should be original Also, Good Morning! 6:30am here My brain : write a love story between a snake and a mongoose Idk how to write smut ~~which is basically what chapters want~~ no wait, idk how to write *any* type of story my english is too poor for that how many 30 💎  scenes will it have? also, leave the plot at cliffhanger! Me too! ~~much much better than WABR~~ and make the chapters WABR level short so that you can write 15 chapters and throw it on the face of those chapters writers hmm... fair point also, apparently chapters has 100+ books all of them romance yass!!!! ~~also, I'm still waiting for epic finale to Marissa Fletcher's adventures~~ 😅 I wonder if MC will die at the end https://discordapp.com/channels/666550779250999306/667451444420411432/694328874758045707 @kaitoo yw! lol hmm... nice! TLPO does sound kinda funny XD ~~whatif ch 5 actually has MC having to do that surgery on a dog?~~😳 > :worry:
this emote scares me but the emote that scares me the most is :dogelick: nooo Imma delete that emote ^ Goodnight Mara! Its gonna be 7am here I should probably sleep too saw what? 👀 do I? no but seriously, what did I do? do you have *proof*? 😨 can someone revoke my tts rights? I am too tempted to use it everyday tts means text to speech this is why I am requesting to revoke my tts rights 🙄 😒 https://tenor.com/view/popcorn-eating-cute-hungry-demi-lovato-gif-16088739 ~~but you aren't asian~~ EXCUSE ME? if you were asian, where is your asian squad role? Black Scepter has both Asia and America squad role where's jordo? > Mr Lawyer Hoerdan, Priya has refused to enter a plea deal
that was my plea. you don't have asian squad role ~~I have never dealt with law before, mb~~ My plea is not guilty The judge is biased I will go to higher form of court https://tenor.com/view/ican-and-iwill-able-warn-dont-dare-me-trust-me-gif-15661884 who made jordon a judge tho? Would you like cash or cheque? thats US spelling I write Indian spellings ✅ there you go a *check* Aye! I wanna charge drew of making me go through the trial at 7am when I haven't slept for the night 🍿 🥱 I want to sleep but I don't want to sleep its 7:34am now IRIS 2.0 doesn't wanna obey me > the bot is alive
@Weiss is this a question or statement? carrots? yes, other things? no Sausage wack Literally anything non-vegetarian is wack I accuse drew of calling me wack yeah... same Drew.. you do you idk about my country 😳 https://tenor.com/view/ight-imma-head-out-spongebob-imma-head-out-ima-head-out-gif-14902967 Good night/day/ w/e guys byee! Imma miss you guys! XDDD https://tenor.com/view/head-scratcher-confused-perplexed-huh-clash-with-cam-gif-10198268 My name is pronounced preeyaaa *cough* tbf its "choti ee" in hindi so its actually priyaa not preeeeeeeyaaaaaaa I know... I am just presenting facts Priya is probably the most common name here in India Like every 3rd movie has a character named Priya My friends can't find me on fb by my real name That is why I had to make another fb account by the name Priyudi Sundari I have 1 friend named Andrew apart from @DaHomieDrew Idk anyone else apart from you @CoolCCMystery named Jordan My name is very common, meanwhile my brother's name is uncommon Vipul its not rare but uncommon I have 5 friends (friends /= acquaintances) named Priya If I include Acquaintances, the list will be quite long XD *cough* Priya Lacroix ooh! is that a good game? I have heard but never played myself hmm... I must try it sometime alright! thanks! A reason why I go with the name Priyudi is to differentiate myself from 1000s of Priyas out there but then unfortunately I found out Priyudi means boyfriend in telugu XD 🤐 *your secret is safe with me* 😉 shoot! Poppy Patel... that's it XD lol. I don't have a gujarati friend sadly My surname is a meme tho and like my name... very common 🤐 yeah it is XD let's see if anyone here can find my surname Patil? nope. I am talking about my real surname @kaitoo no lol you don't have to look far tho My real name is fairly easy to find dang! *dedication* I am not south Indian yeah But I love South India Anyways, hints for my surname - common, meme, Indian hmm... nice! Idk surnames of most of my friends lol Paige... if you look a little deep, you will find it What th- XD Wait, how did you think my surname is Nagpurwala? > Sharma?
@kyo ding ding ding Sharmaji ka beta is a popular meme Told you my name is very common > Priya Sharma?
Yes lol. Its pretty difficult to find common names My friends can never find me on fb ~~Also, spotify has my real name~~ nice! you just had to do this to find my real name smh yeah. he is a bengali naveen means new, banerjee means teacher from bandoghat chaterjee, banerjee, bose etc. are all popular bengali surnames search for sharmaji ka beta you will understand my pain yeah. and because I am sharmaji ki beti (beta is son, beti is daughter) who scored well in school, I was the centre of meme basically, sharma is the surname of some Hindu Brahmins. In olden days, only brahmins were responsible to study and teach so they are often referred to as the nerds and since some sharmas score well, it became a meme because we are always seem as nerds 😔 ~~I am a nerd too~~ but if you look at the HSS prime classmate types, I am mix of nerd and gamer 🤗 lol IRIS 2.0 obeys Activate Project Janus but doesn't obey the reset to normal command afterwards 😒 which ones didn't you understand? @Weiss don't tell me you haven't played ES yet... If a person boosts a server twice, will it be counted as one boost or 2 boosts? so, if I buy nitro and use to boost my server twice, will it upgrade to lvl 2? oh sorry... mb! lvl 1 so if I boost it 15 times, will it get to lvl 2? this server has 3 boosts interesting... so, you use all your boosts on this server? but like you get 2 boosts a month right? so, if you use 2 boosts every month, shouldn't there be like 20 boosts by now in this server? so like 2 boosts - use on up to 2 servers and you will be boosting them till your subscription is there if you cancel your boost to give it to another server, does the server get demoted? so what happens to those extra emotes if you demote? so if for some reason, the 3 people stop boosting this server, will the extra emotes above the regular 50 get deleted? this is also a nitro perk iirc licking a GPU He has also licked RAM because he loves PC parts dora cakes doraemon's favourite 😋 idk. the hindi dub calls it dora cakes, the japanese manga calls it dorayaki iirc https://tenor.com/view/doraemon-fudgy-pie-cute-nom-full-gif-15306757 every 00's indian kids childhood never watched ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ > is the same problem happening again or you are just busy? 😂
@Hurricane I was AFK for the most of the time today, I had to give 2 mock tests yesterday 😅 ehh... it was bad as usual hmm... thanks hmm... Hi hyper! Also, @Hurricane you can chat here whenever you feel lonely, I'm sure someone will be available to talk to you 😃 yeah I think discord glitched for me that day Hey Viv! How's it going? ~~i did not understand the reference~~ ew ew ew ew ew you guys are responsible to make me *insert antonym of innocent* I didn't start witness in-game I only read the code and skip the diamond scenes except for that one chapter 😨 ~~I still regret reading that chapter in detail~~ Drew, will you do the honors of sharing the latest chapter in #recent-chapter-spoilers ? This chapter is... interesting to say the most Good ~~morning~~ night! 👋 for me its the fan and the roof XD Milk at my house comes in plastic bags too this is the milk that I drink Cartoon milk? I- we have milk packets and cartons but since cartons are more expensive, we buy the packet one they literally taste the same Wait. That's illegal. lol. I meant this is why screen goes black since the netflix software doesn't allow screen recording I was trying to insert the once popular meme for phone I think no. the video recorded will be a black screen @Ne-Rwby-On no. only for screen recorders and not cameras ^ maybe find the show pirated somewhere Wot Hi What's Ll Oh ok My favorite book is heroes of Olympus and love interest is interesting books Oh ok Blades of light and shadow and Beckett from elementalists Hi Ah cant decide one fave book VoS probably LI is becca fs What about you Nice Eww I don't want that I'm not gonna update I only press it to see custom emotes when I join a new server indeed what's a winged rat? nvm its a bat dang! she looks powerful and scary (as she should be) oh! so a collection of devas and asuras devas = Agni, Ganesha, Rama, Vamana, Kali
Asuras = Bakasura, Kumbhkarna, Ravana Ravana and Kumbhkarna are brothers Rama and Vamana are incarnations of Lord Vishnu its cause both got different boons Ravana had the boon of being 10 headed and only dying if he was hit on the bellybutton Kumbhkarna had the boon of being really huge and powerful but with a catch that he sleeps for 6 months and wakes for 1 day ~~this is why my mom also calls me Kumbhkarna~~ yeah 😅 not really. At least I don't My mom also calls me narada cause apparently I cause fight between people Our entire mythology is basically 3 gods - Bramha (the creator), Vishnu (The saviour) and Shiva (The destroyer) Everything else is related to them yeah Lord Bramha hasn't taken a form iirc yeah, Kali is angry Parvati who is wife of Lord Shiva oh! Interesting dang! hmm... this design makes more sense but yeah its kinda nsfw Kali is more worshipped in Bengal along with Durga And they are both forms of Parvati. So, Bengalis like Parvati tbh my favourite part of mythology is either incarnations of Vishnu or tales of Ganesha yeah. the story of him getting the elephant head is also interesting mhmm... his own father chopped off his head yeah but he didn't know that the kid was his own son as soon as he knew, he tried to make things right by using head of an baby elephant. And then he kinda made it a rule to worship him first no matter what so, we always start worshipping by chanting Lord Ganesha's name And yeah. Now that I think about it, it does sound like Rheya. But Lord Shiva had a reason to kill Ganesha instead of just pure hatred hmm... I remember watching animated movies on these mythological stories as a kid and getting fascinated yeah. hmm... I mostly watch movies or hear my mom telling tales Animation in India means it should have some moral values 😅 Ooh! new member? Nice nice Have you played every book on choices? ooh! nice! I hope you love being here! ooh! nice! Hi @Mirz All your fave books and LIs are current ones lol This is liquid_blue_24 from reddit btw Oh yeah you guys feel the SAT is tough? try JEE Mains google it. its indian college entrance yeah.

Lockdown 4.0? so, delivery dates before lockdown for the same product used to be like order on tuesday evening, get it by wednesday evening. this time due to lockdown, they asked time till saturday. BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T DISPATCHED IT!
On other hand another delivery service that used to deliver products late told the product would arrive on june 2 but it came on 21 May. So, 🤷 
I am disappointed in amazon now. The fact that the warehouse from where this is supposed to come is like 30 km from my home. Amazon is just being lazy thankyou for listening to my TED talk. you may continue doing your work now I am tempted to watch these lol but I don't wanna have nightmares After I found interest in different methods of violence, I watched these to escape studies but studies had some other plans for me like the video started talking about my 11th grade physics and I was like - No, I'm out! 😔 Also, I should have known since its a Vsauce video or y'know, just put the title as server icon and nothing else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ :chef's😗: Today would have been the day I would have left Delhi for good but NO!

I think my mom has that I just have ||heavy boobies 😔 || me too 😔 tfw you don't know ||which cup you are cause you wear a sports bra 😭 || I don't remember the ||last time I got mine, I have irregular periods since the beginning. But whenever they come, they come w/o any warning. || oof! I have only taken a pill once when I had excruciating pain in 11th grade I think That happens with my mom tho. Although my parents never get past mild swearing like only swear my dad ever said is "saala" (it means husband of your sister, supposed to be an insult) its an insult because in India, people can only ||fuck|| each other when they are married. so saying that someone is husband of your sister means that they can ||fuck|| her ye heh. I never used "saala" tho since cursing is really frowned upon. So, I made up my own curse words to release my frustration My favourite one is "Koodhe ka beej" which means seed of garbage sure what does that mean? XD lol. the most common swear used in my house is "Kamina" (even I use it a lot) and it means slavish. me too but not the meanings of most of them omg ye I heard someone say that in 7th grade and I blatantly asked my mom - "Ma, what is the meaning of ||bhenchod||" and my mom was like - "where did you hear it?" most of the indian swears are related to ||fucking women related to you|| ye no but I don't think its incest :WTFthonk: lol. I wanna hear chinese swears now ye yup yeah. but its like a to b: ||bhenchod||
means a will ||fuck b's sister|| We subscribed to many OTT services last year like prime and hotstar. Their shows have really bad curse words like the one feenie said. My brother is being trained a lot earlier than I am XD Cursing 101 ft. Benji, Nikos, Me and Feenie Benji, you are making me feel like I don't know English *at all* so basically wag = bunk? maybe spoiler tag it 👀 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0 the one lady talking about auras in the beginning gave me teagon (AME) vibes tbh the post was deleted there was a video idr exactly but it was sth like someone opening a best buy using forklift?! Does anyone know if bolas 2 going to come on Wednesday? Ok oof! Sorry to hear that 😔 good luck Viv! Hope its nothing major Olivia 😘 everything its in #future-spoilers iirc also, TRH spoilers can't be discussed outside of #future-spoilers and #recent-chapter-spoilers for 48 hours it all depends on what am I supposed to calculate at the end. the variables mean different but as long as they produce the same answer, it doesn't matter. There are more than one way to solve an equation in Math. the variable will have different value but we were never supposed to find out values of variables. we were only supposed to find out the RHS of last equation so it doesn't matter what you chose to be a variable but they are 2 similar flowers so it would simply mean that 1 flower = 2flower divided by 2 we aren't assuming. the flowers indeed look exactly the same unlike the emotes you used to describe the problem also, isn't algebra all about assumption tho Quick mafs everybody > 20 + 20 + 20 = 60
> 20 + 5 + 5 = 30
> 5 -2 = 3
> 20 + 5 + 2 = 27
@oge you have made a mistake at the end And one petal @Andromeda  yeah I've heard people eating turtles pretty sure mostest is not a word but carry on Also, hey Zee! "mostest" what's moonpig? ooh nice > Probably will call me cheap but I don’t like paying for things more than they’re worth :worry:

@Raven That's enough reason. *All hail Queen Zee!* ^ Welcome! what's your fave book and LI? ooh nice uhhh no nope. no problem with screenshots either Sad I won't be surprised if I get to see a feral in some corner of the street now Indeed _Flashbacks of bloodbound_ https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/news/2010/10/1001027-rabies-influenza-zombie-virus-science Well well well ```It's theoretically possible—though extremely difficult—to create a hybrid rabies-influenza virus using modern genetic-engineering techniques, the University of Miami's Andreansky said.
"Sure, I could imagine a scenario where you mix rabies with a flu virus to get airborne transmission, a measles virus to get personality changes, the encephalitis virus to cook your brain with fever"—and thus increase aggression even further—"and throw in the ebola virus to cause you to bleed from your guts. Combine all these things, and you'll [get] something like a zombie virus," she said.
"But [nature] doesn't allow all of these things to happen at the same time. ... You'd most likely get a dead virus."```
This is kinda like the summary MY LAPTOP FINALLY TURNED ON!

@literal legend. ikr must be terrible > SpaceX and NASA have always used the metric system and Celsius @Deleted User
@oge well.. good for them Indeed The most superior system :shifty: no u :reverse: :reverse: ~~but there are only 2 yellow reverses in a deck~~ so this one is not valid > I like both systems 😆
Diplomat idek how long a mile is kilometre ftw! yup Its discussed in #choices-chat or #open-heart Km ftw! kilometre No offense 🙏 :LMFAOdead: there was also this barbeque flavour confusion meme What about it? it was sth like when americans see kilometre per hour instead of eagleeyes per bananas or sth and then a confused person picture with caption bbq flavour confusion yeah this one but it was more texas based I think :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: HEY ZAK! Eh I feel religion is one of the major cancers in the world Starting from the beginning of mankind Sonia *chefskiss* Yeah but that kinda rarely happens I don't think religion and having faith in god is bad if it gives someone hope to live. yeah I respect it my mom is a religious person. She finds it therapeutic to talk to god. I am not really religious and my parents respect that My parents aren't that religious We just go to the temple once or twice a year but I remember studying about how mughals and even brits forced people to change their religion. Now, that was awful Especially mughals I believe yeah lmao I find every comment of trump repulsive 😐 > Lik is there even one decent leader
@azula new Zealand's pm is pretty cool Narendra Modi ftw! (tho he also messes up sometimes) Every holy book have similar verses > Narendra Modi ftw! (tho he also messes up sometimes)
@Deleted User he kinda messed up the lockdown big time > @Deleted User he kinda messed up the lockdown big time
@Deleted User I disagree He tried his best Its not his fault people didn't listen I meant regarding the migrant workers Oh yeah. but he was being pressurized. Democracy didn't help him there Also, he keeps messing from timr to time like the whole CAA thing Yeah that's why he could have given some time for them to reach home but its still less than many people out there imo Like in Singapore He was outta nowhere like from 12 o clock the entire country will be under lockdown I mean the workers were like send us home send us home. the moment govt. decided to send them home, like a week later, some of them wanted to come back because jobs were opening Hmm I also feel that the lockdown was announced a bit early Which I don't blame him for that actually gave people time to prepare He couldn't have predicted this this way, there are less people who take COVID casually > that actually gave people time to prepare
@Deleted User no I meant like when most countries hit the peak they were under lockdown but India couldn't continue the lockdown for this long So we are reopening before we hit the peak even yeah but atleast he was able to delay the peak and make people be prepared I guess so > Iirc he called someone a "50-crore girlfriend" or smth
@literal legend. I don't recall this I mean, he *does* mess up time to time. I am not sure about the 50-crore gf thing tho Same A fat guy who doesn't die Baz Or a girl 🤔 🤔 Eh he said there would be a 20 lakh crore rupees package for farmers and migrant workers 🤷‍♀️ ehh I mean, his party (democracy) is miles better than the opposition who ruled for 50+ years Also, muslims do get benefits here Agreed that he is a bit right winged but yeah His party is hindu based and that's why he supports hindus more. But he is not the reason islamophobia is rampant here I dunno about that But you will be surprised, he hasn't given a single press conference till now Although I have muslim friends and they don't feel scared at all > His party is hindu based and that's why he supports hindus more. But he is not the reason islamophobia is rampant here
@Deleted User but I feel it increased in india after he came to power Not just islamophibia it actually did. Like a divide and rule People bring religion into anything Movies web series books anything but I personally don't really feel its as exaggerated irl as portrayed in show biz or internet > They say the islamophobia is very intense
@literal legend. where in India do they live? I think islamophibia becomes more intense as you proceed to the north Yeah. Areas matter a lot. Like if you live in an area where muslims are concentrated, Hindus feel scared. Similarly if a muslim lives in a hindu concentrated area, they feel scared Yeah Like the area where I live is mostly hindus. but there's a colony around a kilometer away from my home which has mostly muslims yeah Yeah Kashmir is the only Muslim dominated state that is why muslims get reservation in education and jobs since they are minority ^ along with christians and scheduled castes and tribes But sometimes they too misuse the minority status Lemme give you an example for that Hindus are also killed by mobs but barely anyone reports that because they are minority That is one example Like I am preparing for a college entrance.
There are about 120 seats in the CS branch in the top most college.
About 50% of them are open seats (meaning anyone can take them)
27% is OBC (other backward classes)
15% is SC (Scheduled Castes)
7.5% is ST (Scheduled Tribes)
Now, someone like me can only apply to open category but someone of the reserved class can apply in both. Agreed that still doesn't justify killing Muslims either Now problem with that is someone getting 100/300 marks can get a seat there because they are from reserved categories but someone with 270/300 can't because open seats fill up quickly result - same class has a person with 100 marks and 280 marks. defeating the purpose of conducting entrance to get good students > Oh that's fair
@literal legend. yeah it's fair for people who are below poverty line, but the problem the problem arises in the next generation If I am a person below poverty line, I can get the perks of these reservations and subsequently I can get a good job and lift myself out of poverty and live a good life But then if I have kids they are well to do but since their dad (me) belonged to reserved category they get the same perks yeah So basically my kids are living like a general candidate but they still get the perks of reserved candidates > Being above the poverty line doesn't necessarily always mean more privileged though
@literal legend. yeah it doesn't and the worst part is that people like these use up the benefits repeatedly but people who deserve don't get access because they aren't aware enough ^ but truth be told, most don't and those who do don't get to enjoy these benefits due to a number of reasons corruption being a major one Yeah Hmm I have lived in 4 different places. I have never seen anyone getting discriminated in front of me nor did I ever felt any difference. yes, it does sting that someone with reservation would get the same job as me with less input and hard work but doesn't mean I become a jerk And same goes for others. I have a friend who is from Scheduled Caste and talk about their elders getting oppressed back in the 60s or 70s but their parents or they never faced any difficulty whatsoever. Times are changing It is prominent if you are the odd one out in your area but that works both ways I personally feel like some devious politicians give money to spark these riots and stuff and insert religion everywhere I read it somewhere like not all cops are ||bitch||, not all whites are racist and stuff like that. I completely agree and stand by that point. Some evil peeps spoil the name of everyone in their community and that extends here too hmm... why do I remember that post saying ||bitch|| ^ oh yeah definitely America and Europe dealing with racism while we Indians be dealing with religion. 2020 is wack The Police is flawed here as well Corruption and bias This is a universal fact. People who stick out like a sore thumb are oppressed by majority. Doesn't matter how are you different. It can be race, caste, gender etc. and that needs to stop I feel the difference between India and USA right now is that in USA apparently whites have privilege but in India it's not like Hindus have any privilege Infact Hindus mostly used to be the ones to compromise, but that is slowly changing which isn't good either, every citizen is supposed to be treated equally Hmm Anyways, I have to sleep now. Goodnight! Gn! I. CAN'T. SLEEP > I. CAN'T. SLEEP
@Deleted User this is pretty late I slept at 9am I think Woah whoa there is a role called choices analyzer here 🤤  I wonder how many roles this server has that are/aren't in use 🤔 hmm... I have only heard about 9k4 and never really talked to them.

I like it. ~~so how much more evil needs to enter you to make you like spoilers~~ welp. that's impossible. lol. we know. ~~you hate listening spoilers, only like uploading them~~ 🤨 welp, the release schedule is so bad these days that spoilers are only uploaded on wednesdays and they aren't anything interesting why would I bet when I already know the entire chapter Also, betting only works if 2 people are thinking differently. We both agree that today's chapter is gonna be short as usual https://www.marketwatch.com/story/theres-a-one-in-three-chance-of-a-massive-disaster-that-could-be-worse-than-covid-19-says-deutsche-bank-2020-06-17?mod=home-page What if 2020 is just the trailer of the upcoming decade? O_o then she has planned to learn either C++/python depending on her mood ~~and she already knows C and some other ancient languages she learnt in her computer degree~~ nope she learns stuff because she is curious she recently did a lvl 1 to 13 in one go playthrough of zuma deluxe I was like - you should have recorded and put that on youtube then she knows how to stitch, knit, and even make soft toys And she promised me to teach me how to make threep and uwu once my exams are over it is quite addictive I must say She played it for the first time in 2010 lol. looks like zuma is *mom's* game then she has made so many paintings that most of them have to be in boxes because we don't have space to hang them she also has a file showing different art forms like sand painting, emboss painting, fabric painting etc. then she also made all the food I showed in #irl-squad . She is quite creative and always hungry to learn more it wasn't intentional XD like she also wants to learn how to play a piano EXACTLY! And I am soo jealous of her She even designed dresses for me same she wanted to learn game development but our PC wasn't capable enough to install the unity hub and she always be like - I wanted to teach whatever I learnt in my life to my children but none of you are interested I know. and whenever she feels depressed, her worries are - "I haven't even learnt *insert skills she hasn't learnt yet*! How can I die?" lol. I will be a computer engineer in future (most likely) so I will be joining your squad soon @Strife my dad is complete opposite tho I am technically passed out of school. only 5 years of college left to get the master's degree! yeah. its gonna take a long time in India too although I don't mind "taking notes digitally" era we currently have I mean the current gen we have is pretty cool and better than those earlier gens of learning we had my dad definitely hates the current era lol he despises computers and work from home is hitting hard for him especially when I am sleeping or away my dad is literal definition of boomer like he was once out for 2 days so I texted him. Every reply was so formal I was like - "Am I your boss or sth?" but seriously. My dad's a boomer! If we look it that way, everything has its pros and cons still. Atleast I am quite familiar with internet slangs and references now Like EnGr said, depends on how much the person is willing to learn I have living examples in my house lol like my mom and dad are only 5 years apart yet my dad is a huge boomer and my mom makes me jealous my dad's dad uses FB since 2011 my dad still doesn't use FB my grandpa is less boomer than my dad I've had FB account since 3rd grade (that's 2009) but I rarely use it lol I used to use fb to play games back in the day wtf there was a green book beside me. I checked and its a 2001 diary that's not for sale. What is it doing on my bed lol > And good way for chatting with friends
@oge Haha. I didn't have any friends so I only used it for games whoa. so many collectibles > How do you randomly get a book?
@oge when you are in a room as messy as mine, you randomly stumble upon stuff lmao. maybe?! I wanna make the switch to firefox but my job gets done on chrome so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ~~no way I am using edge~~ yeah I remember how when I was getting support from microsoft, they used edge as the browser but the second time (like after the restart) he was like f it, imma use chrome > And secure your privacy
this feels like a sponsored ad ngl what's next? duck duck go? 😂 OwO o.0 nice I was reading chapter description of DS and this is what I see unless you are doing some hot shot stuff that involves money or really private data, I don't think we need to be *that* secure. Just keep checking all the app perms on mobile, keep changing your password regularly and separate your personal, financial and social accounts tbh all of this comes down to what point do you find suitable for you in the convenience vs. security graph I am more inclined on convenience now since I don't have much risky stuff but once I will have a job? Who knows how paranoid Imma be for my money and info that's what's happening in delhi too :OOF: Try gargling and taking steam 🤷‍♂️ My mom's friend was able to avoid getting coronavirus when her husband was tested positive by taking steam and gargling continuously Yeah its not covid I was talking about the coughing About how you might reduce it At home If there's no doctor ^ ^ Do any of you freak out by how eerily true the Simpson's predictions are? It's kinda creepy Especially the one with trump ^ Used to Now boycotting it :LMFAOdead: Shooting bow and arrows in minecraft must also count as a shooting game! ~~how can anyone pronounce bui as *boy*?~~ Also, the professor's *request* was total BS I really hate when people mispronounce names. I have a fairly common name so it hasn't happened to me except when my cousins try to speak with their weird haryanvi accent and it pisses me off! wut? that's really weird idts that's really not okay dang! I feel like "Thankgod I never went abroad" after hearing these things aww that's nice that's so cute > One time I was in the mall and a guy came up to me and asked "You Korean or Vietnamese?" and I was like "Neither?" And then his friend was like "I fuckin told you, she's probably Chinese"
This is absolutely messed up 😖 I remember there was this one North-east Indian girl in my school who looked chinese (because the north east states are literally next to china) and my friend always used to give chocolates whenever she saw that girl in school. ~~tbh east asians look really cute~~ and my friend used to fangirl like look how cute and innocent she is lol. I can imagine I saw one guy in my school literally call a notrth eastern ching chong 😖 I was like wtf..? I had an instructor who looked east asian and boy she didn't look 40+ at all I should have stood up for her but I didn't want to get into trouble Sounds selfish of me now that I think back 😖 My school was literally the opposite in this regard since there were only like 2 north east students > Why would you get in trouble???
@Kwote I dunno I just had a feeling 🤷‍♀️ and everyone thought they looked cute oof :OOF: ~~I am supposed to be asleep rn because I have to wake up at 8:30am but I am waiting for Zak's AMA cause I am really excited and that its their first live event~~ same tbh I m a nightowl I have a commitment in the morning that I can't really deny so RIP me The lockdown screwed up my sleep schedule even more! My sleep schedule is basically - pull an all nighter then sleep early the next day, then pull an all nighter and the cycle goes on and on :LMFAOdead: I had plans of focusing on myself after my exams get over WHY IS 5pm EST 2:30 AM HERE?!!! But the exam never got over 😖 lmao mood My parents don't let me pull all nighters I can never sleep before 10pm all nighters are easy to pull off for me my mom only hates all nighters when I don't eat in the morning before sleeping Your mom knows that you pull all nighters? yeah. she is cool with it as long as I don't screw up my eating schedule Damn My mom doesn't sleep before I do All nighters usually mean I sleep at 10-11am I see All nighters for me are more frequent these days because discord usually gets more active at night ~~since majority of people I talk to are from the western hemisphere~~ yeah but unfortunately I don't. RIP 38 minutes more!!! hhh I am more worried about waking up at 8:30am tomorrow It would be more easy for me if my timezone was like 4 hours behind of what it is now I can't wake up properly before atleast 7 hours of sleep EnGr really talks like a 40+ year old lol its cool! XD Half the time nowadays I sleep late because I want to upload spoilers or talk about them. Then there's the fact I can't fall asleep easily. ~~just search for the times I say "I can't sleep" and you'll get the idea~~ lol. that's true tho yeah I mean, there is no harm in changing a profile picture... as long as Doge is okay with it I dare you kill them with sarcasm next time when they annoy you I dare you to sell their house :LMFAOdead: 😱 uwu 😏 🤦 🤦 https://media.tenor.com/images/23b1e0ad4b4c610c483d4a518e84a827/tenor.gif WE ARE ALIVE the Mayan calendar has to be a scam! changed my colour, nickname and pfp because why not oof! sorry to hear that. hmm... ~~maybe try in the morning because there is more of a chance of pfp changing in fast connection than slow~~ Also, you should complain about it to the ISP yeah iirc he's paying 10 bucks a month to get this mod Happy Birthday @Catherine !!! 🥳 then...  belated happy birthday I guess https://discordapp.com/channels/447426832371810305/447581814400221194/709466185938501732 @ZATheDeadMan Seems like that bell Delphine's bath water sort of shit 😂 🙏 I wanna take this test but it's not free Guess I will never know my ancestors 🥺 how much does it cost anyway?

I woke up that day, saw the academy and was back at about 5:45am. then I waited for 15 minutes to finally see how the channel activated at 6 oh! In India it was thing from 2007 to 2011 or 2012 you pinged the wrong Priyudi lol. that's Yukki and my home has a room free if you wanna move in 😉 uhhh cheese spaghetti cake Parantha Ha!

Along with bunch of other benefits ...but it's expensive The weekly subscription is good to try tho. Unlimited keys means you can also re read the old books . Pb does try to take vote on their upcoming stories through the poll in insider email. True. I think things will get more clear once VIP rolls out to everyone I think it started in november And they are saying they'll release VIP at end of summer they said they are planning to roll out VIP for everyone *soon* ye. they are trying to calm us down by using the word soon but on twitter they said end of summer ~~really?~~ ~~ahh~~ ~~for some reason I thought there were 500+ members~~ ~~i suppose so~~ I like a fam of like 50 members.

@azula that's what my city's chief minister did lmao. then central govt. intervened and increased no. of tests :hawyee: Damn I'm sorry to hear that I dunno if this is happening in other places but here I've heard of many cases where the patient recovers and then after 1 or 2 weeks dies of a heart attack Hmm True Hmm There's a bubonic plague spreading in some city in northern china And another pandemic potential virus > it's just one case

They used edge over chrome but after restart, they were like - F it, we gonna use chrome the support was for powerpoint, the solution was disabling hardware acceleration but they were so confused that they spent 4 hours fixing it but I did get 1 month of Microsoft 365 for free so I wasn't angry XD this guy? lol btw twitch's also working fine for me in case you didn't notice XD Happy new year 2020 was the biggest scam ever 21 may be even worse :WTFthonk: Hi Benji!

Well feel free to ignore me. I’ll stay here with the irrelevants and just casually roll my eyes. > i don't think she cares for your chances anyways buddy
@soulsis' meowson  I guess I just have a different definition of ‘fun.’ As in, I try not to ruin others having it. > @Deleted User youve played HSS the app right?
@DaHomieDrew  Nope. Just CoD. It was in ROE right? Didn’t Natara’s parents own it or something? I actually searched for it in the App Store recently hoping it would somehow still be there They made her seem like she was the CEO though lol Thank you @kyo 🙂 thank you @kyo ! I wonder what would this year's YouTube rewind be like :WTFthonk: my laptop says 10:52 but its actually 16:22 lmao the titles are so cringe oh yeah that film was legit ooh! you watched Neerja? yeah 😔 I don't like Neerja that much but yeah it was a good movie My fav movie all time has to be Drishyam. I can watch it repeatedly for hours without getting bored I have parasite in my watchlist. My mom and brother found it cringe for some reason tho ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ they have watched almost triple the amount of movies I have lol Condolences Viv 🙏 🙏 sorry to hear that Viv... deep condolences 😔 I’m so sorry for your loss. Please take care of yourself x nahh... it wasn't a convo killer at all. I'm glad you consider all of us as friends and shared it with us... Hiya! ooh! y'all talking about me? aww thankyou Hilda!

WB! lmao hiya yukki! ily2! UwU hey! welcome to the server! there's no such thing as too much cake viv! also, happy anniversary! Welcome welcome Choices servers mostly get active when something new releases Or gets updated in PBs database in case of spoiler land XD Agreed that was beta iirc official was in August ~~as long as someone would explain the rules to me~~ TCTF :chefkiss: or we can have sth like what y'all did on valentines when I was new I don't remember much but we had this event here where some secret messages were sent and Feenie won it looked fun tho lol you can run a poll based on what we should do for the anniversary or we can play CAH choices edition where cards are all choices references we can add sentences like - I went `_____` when I first saw Sam Dalton or sth maybe some people who are interested can contribute and one of them can consolidate all the data oh yeah that would be cool XD. I recently played a lot of CAH its fun we can also do a short RP or maybe a game where we create a story with choices characters but every member only gets to type one sentence XD
I am just giving ideas. Not all ideas have to be good lol what's a chomchom roller? oh cool XD. why is it called chomchom tho? oh cool! true XD nahh... more minds would also mean more ideas so its better to discuss with everyone lol yeah ~~also, in case you decided to go one man army and sth went wrong, others will glare at you. So, its better to get every staff member's consent lol~~ lolol IoIoI ahahaha y'all did it wrong it was IoIoI not lolol wot :wut: well, I didn't do it intentionally ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ XD same sadly mine very well do 😭 yup lol my mom knows I play but hasn't seen me playing live @MaralinaSakura do you play pokemon on consoles or emulators? you have a GBA? damn! and do you have 3ds? or switch? wow *bows in respect* NINTENDO! IF YOU ARE HERE PLEASE OFFICIALLY LAUNCH YOUR CONSOLES IN INDIA AT A FAIR PRICE! I WILL NOT PAY THE PRICE OF SWITCH FOR A SWITCH LITE AND WORRY ABOUT WARRANTY! custom duties are a mess which my parents don't wanna deal with damn! its about 45% for electronics if I import from US it is :dopeysob: there used to be filmywap for bollywood movies but :RIP: filmywap same aww oof she probably misses her owner she'll get used to it... *eventually* this is why I don't want a pet my brother keeps thinking of how he'll grieve when the dog will die since he wants to own a dog my brother gets attached too easily so we are afraid to get him a dog he comes up with stuff like he'll get a dog when he's old so they both die at same time that's fair I don't think I'll ever be ready for such a responsibility and would end up hurting the pet so I don't ever wanna be a pet owner sorry to hear that Hyper... 😔 imo Zoey looks prettier than Ian/Ina. good luck Viv! I hope there's nothing to worry about! 😄 o We only have one Ikea in India and its in hyderabad ikea product names are weird.

yes. they were planning to open more but Covid the hyderabad one opened in 2018 iirc Indian ikea has vegetarian swedish ***meat***balls fjefhnhwuf like how is it vegetarian if its a meatball what use is the food if its like 2k kilometers away > In our cuisine we have something similar to meatballs called kofte
@oge kofte is literally an Indian dish fdnwufur (they are potato or bottlegourd balls in gravy) I had kofte for dinner last week o can't believe its called kofte in India too also, fnwuifuwehd these were like 5 rs. in Goa its me crazy typing fnweufuw what Anhi said also I thought google would also mention bulgaria 😛 but they like - no its Indian is balkan = bulgaria? :furballthink: oh ok that makes sense ahh hmm... nice normally cuisines would have similar stuff but under different names but its called kofte in both the places yup like rotis are called quesadilla (pardon my spelling) in mexico oop. they aren't sweet tho ahh! are they made by spreading batter on pan? or dough? hmm... cause rotis are made using clay-ey dough which is basically wheat flour + water ahh We have vegetarian pancakes like thingy called *puda* (idk if that's the right word, I hate it) oh yeah this I think first pic is made from gram flour, other pics are wheat flour (we make using wheat flour) Mamma usually makes poodas during sheetala mata pooja (a festival of sorts where you can't cook food till afternoon and are supposed to eat cold food) but I never eat them 😛 yeah kinda. we are supposed to eat cold food made previous night (mostly fried stuff and gulgulas and poodas) but I just skip meals lol I do have to eat a little due to tradition tho So I just taste a bread pakoda XD ^ pretty sure its a virtual child or a pet ~~wouldn't be surprised if its animal crossing sifjvrijf~~ ~~unlike how PB decided to name michael jacob but then changed last moment~~ Happy Birthday @Water Puppies @Water Puppies @Water Puppies @Water Puppies @Water Puppies 

okay, Now I'm done XD lol. In all seriousness, Quinn = Queen
Can't change my mind! Welcome @вера ! Fav book and Li? these online classes sometimes get so funny istg like I went to set up speakers for my brother's class and someone's dad legit came half naked and the girl was so flustered conspiracy theory : whatif people voted for Zoey so they don't have to vote again for Iana? I was kidding.

Me too Same And there are a lot of roaches in my current house for some reason Bugs have proteins I have to call my parents everyone I see them since I can't kill them on my own :LMFAOdead: https://media.tenor.com/images/da0c2dc801a68a246991b19026a306bf/tenor.gif Ever encountered a flying cockroach? I haven't And I don't wish to 🤮 🤮 I have ants Prawns are the insects of the sea Wasn't there some news that swarms of Japanese hornets were invading US? What about flies? I use those big hand thingie Locusts are delicious Centipedes and millipedes and hornets are really dangerous Scorpions also https://media.tenor.com/images/917a1a60db817a0b0b671f22e68345ce/tenor.gif Yep They are awesome Especially the shape of their head Though a mongoose can be successful in killing it https://media.tenor.com/images/3769ba909d9a36c282c48c009dd42bb5/tenor.gif This bad boy Yeah King cobra Though I'm afraid of snakes Just like to see on tv Nope that's because the channel doesn't update as frequent as the 'people' section on the right yeah Good luck!

~~help us she is turning us all into Mara stans~~
~~jk, its her right~~ Happy birthday! @MaralinaSakura oof! End of 2021 I see I've read many articles which tell the same thing It will take a long time for life to get normal Pretty horrifying how everyone's lives changed in such a short amount of time :hawyee: Hmm The LIs are too perfect Istg :WTFthonk: Imma post the speech video Post the one which has captions yeah I think there are captions 🧐 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV_eNrTF8Nc the subtitles were pretty toned down tho :hawyee: This speech will be immortal ikr okay context time : the guy giving speech heavily relies on rote learning and to teach him a lesson + show a friend how rote learner he is, a guy used find and replace in word to change 2 words specifically. Chamatkar (wonders) to ||Balatkaar (rape)|| and dhan (money, fortune) to stan (tiddies).
If you now read the speech, the meaning is completely changed The main protagonist also wanted to teach him a lesson because the guy giving the speech was distracting other students from studying for their exams by sending ||playboy magazines|| to them so that he has less competition but then would we have VIP books on polls again when they release publicly? I'm all for more options tbh doge will simply cheat and copy paste Doggy Doggie https://media.tenor.com/images/87074b2a51c9c328f32180843737c77d/tenor.gif If you have posted anything anti Chinese you would get arrested in Hong Kong :dopeywhat: :LMFAOdead: I don't get it... I mean the only thing they have in common is they are fat ... I don't get pissed :LMFAOdead: 🙏 True Insiders might release on 7th august if my calculations are right usually its first friday of month but last month, it was 2nd friday (10th july) it comes out for everyone at the same time it comes out at the same time for you but you cannot play it omg viv you have longer legs than I thought I agree with the doctor tbh that's exxagerating no one's feet dangle imo oh yeah. since we now have colour bot, all the name roles were deleted yes because why not? Fish is amazing https://media.tenor.com/images/4f57a1e249a79689d9a87517a3764dea/tenor.gif :dva: :shifty: :WTFthonk: :mmYea: https://media.tenor.com/images/014a81d06a1bcecfc9e5f3c1ee975f38/tenor.gif same tbh I love y'all UwU what type of icon?

I am feeling more bitchy lately XD Happy birthmonth drew XD 👀 good or good? oof! Sorry to hear that Viv! I hope you and your family recover soon Wish you a speedy recovery 🙏 speaking of hobbies, do you guys know about how there were certain *trends* in school? (rubiks cube, those string thingies, fidget spinners etc.) lol. so, when the trends were popular, I would always be the kid who said - this is absurd and I will not give in to those trends (manly because my parents wouldn't buy me those kinds of stuff) and then when my parents would agree, I would buy and get addicted to them. So, the trend would always have died down by the time I would pick up that hobby and everyone would be like - oh so now you decided to hop on the train huh omg yes I demolded (is tha the correct word?) 2 bottles since I tried to flip mineral water bottles which are made of cheap plastic I remember my classmate once doing it and the bottle flew and stood on the ceiling fan that was epic ~~but then we had to hear scolding from our teacher and the guy had to climb on a bench to get the bottle down~~

It was off lol. Imagine throwing a bottle at a fan that is switched on true it was the month of like november or december so the fans were switched off also, throwback to that one time a guy played PUBG and streamed it on class board while the teacher was teaching I was the new kid and the class was filled with insane people like these oh yeah and then in middle school, games like temple run 2 and subway surfers > @Deleted User Did the teacher not notice or something?
@Ne-Rwby-On The guy used to switch screens to the presentation when the teacher turned back The teacher did get suspicious since I and a couple other students were trying hard not to laugh wow. nice My favourite class/grade in all of my school life has to be 8th grade tho It was an emotional rollercoaster but a good and memorable one I guess some of it also had to do with the fact we all hit puberty mhmm we grew up all of a sudden and many became *rebels* in that age it was fun to see everything unfold nice nice although lives were simpler in elementary school, it wasn't that memorable or fun heh. I got exposed to curse words in 7th grade 😎 oof lol I had games with curse words before too but I was never curious to know their meanings or apply them in my convos lmao imagine your teacher hearing it and then be like : Andrew! Behave yourself! oof! ~~looks like I was a decent and non-curious kid XD~~ my brother on the other hand... he is a different story oof the only time I got hit was for hiding my grades in 10th grade ~~I just hid 2 A2s in SST :linkShrug: ~~ A2 = 81-90% 😬 oof damn! ~~meanwhile me sleeping in day and waking up at night as if my brain lives in US~~ I thought physical discipline was a more asian thing tbh since that's what the TV shows and movies depicted. same. but my family was an exception among the people we knew lol all my friends and cousins were ||hit||  multiple times by their parents using multiple ||items|| Is your dad inspired by asian stereotypical parents? anytime kyo! oof just had to look up what capri sun is and it looks like American Rasna This gud Wish all of you a speedy recovery 🙏 I was born using a C-section The due date was 24 march. My mom was at her mom's place to give birth and my dad was 2k kms away from her > Oh what ur mom didn't go to a hospital @Deleted User
@azula she did. for a checkup on 9th march. doctor said that I would die if I wasn't yeeted by 10th march anywhere between 3-7 yeah ~~I rarely drink water~~ 😛 water tastes bland lol oof ~~I know that can't be true lol~~ bruh moment aww Viv! *hugs*
Sorry to hear about your grandma. I know it must be hard... My condolences to you and may she rest in peace 🙏 I loved how like the very early books had so many inter-series references they aren't that common now :/ btw Welcome! yeah 😅 cool! ~~shadow court really looks dope and so wallpaper worthy lol~~

@azula you okay 😦😦😦 Hey hey Look Its gonna fine It will Look at me, I live and im just a lowly scrub > Haha I'll try my best to live
@azula please rephrase that It should "I Will survive" So, when I was 2-3 years old, my mom got this exclusive shampoo from her maiden home (which was like 2k kms away from my then current home). Since its so far away and we didn't go often, she brought a 1.5kg bottle. My innocent soul thought it was a good idea to use it for bubble bath and I legit poured the entire shampoo bottle (which was quite full) in my bathtub. The entire bathroom got filled with suds and when my mom tried to pick me up, I kept slipping from her hands because of the shampoo. The entire bathroom also got slippery, it was a huge mess. So, 1.5kg shampoo bottle down the drain. She never bothered to buy it again XD oop > Pri why
@MaralinaSakura Because bubble baths two words creepy RA 😈 kinda. like it depends if you are into that type of things @azula how you feeling matey meh-son thanks XD Welcome @Have to return some videotapes ! Hey Viv How are you feeling matey Your the admin 2018 wow Viv is the pinnacle and seems to be the remaining member of the old lot so I think this server.is rightfully hers Oh then.... Nevermind ~~I have a normal foot~~ ~~no flat feet or ath~~ *rants* Although i grew up with an Iron Fist And i mean my parents put the Russians to shame due to my up bringing No They lived there for a bit Actually a lot of places Im from the UK so my parents were rigid and mad Love them to bits, but holy shit I'm a grown guy but I can't say anything bad to my mum Hey guys > Lea Michele is a shithead
@azula she seems hot so I don't mind What makes her a shithead though I don't know her to well One sec For a civvy, celebrity and a actress she is As a human shes not so bad Let me rephrase that As a person she's meh > And she bullied the poc actors on Glee
@azula im sorry what??? MF Wow rude How rude and just dick headish Yes Lea Michele is yes Not Viv, Viv is cool before cool was cool I dont knownher to well I think she looks hot Definitely smash But not date What Im just being honest Shit in someone's wig 🤣🤣🤣 Thats to far But funny I work in a very hard hitting job We have dark humour So to me threatening and doing is two different things Military Daamn I always wanted to join the military But then there is opposition from my parents and I am not fit enough :mmNo: Neither was I Mentally Oh, what made you join then? I might not have the capability to be in sfs or any regiment and I'm not so keen on air force or navy but I still want to be connected to the military in some way Im from the middle east originally Noice Which country? But my family and culture we have always been thinkers, warriors, soldiers, Lords, ladies visa versa That sounds cool It was a high honour for a young boy to take the life of a warrior and for the women in the family or house to pursue her own path Until the last few generations my family have been a joke to the old ways What changed? But me and my grandad decided to change that, he joined the military and out all the children, legitimate or bastards that middle Easterners are known to spawn I was the only to dare myself to do it But you ask why I joined?? To this day I have no clue 🤣, people ask why I go *ummmmmmm* :WTFthonk: Which country are you from? And are you in the army? Yes I am Daamn Im from the middle east but I joined the UK army Oh so you are a citizen of UK Noice Yes That's cool *shrug* Its nothing just a job 🤔 mate don't thank me i feel awkward then Imo working for the military is a matter of pride And respect Guardsman, I have a lot of pride and arrogance and the mindset im better than all other regiments But thats how we are taught when we do Guards Respect to you bro ✊ On here im just me Mate its fine I do it.cos I enjoy it That's good I say anything can sign up but only a select few decide to do something about it I see I was in training for 8 long looong months Must've been hard Little sleep at the start and just mental battering  (should've been physical) I started with 50 odd people Finished with less than half :OOF: Please don't thank me I do it because I enjoy it Were you tricked by your trainer that the water you are drinking  is from the gutter but actually it's just normal water? > Were you tricked by your trainer that the water you are drinking  is from the gutter but actually it's just normal water?
@Deleted User what no They just made our sleep to like 3, 4 hours Hehe Made us do horrid nitty taskings Yeah @MaralinaSakura people are just arrogant and sad @Andromeda a lot of things ub3r b0t contributing to !daily commands XD yeah. looks cute imo Hello What's going on peoples Thats pretty gud no. I only heard about drag queens from you lol ooh gimme link thankyou! Imma watch it and tell you my thoughts! OMG ok so it started off normal and I was like okay... but then they did those flips and splits and I was - :dopeywhat: That was legit worthy of not elimating either those contestants literally lip-synced and danced like their lives depended on it ooh its really cool does drag queen mean they are all trans? Since everyone I saw so far are trans oh! ooh so correct me if I am wrong, but drag = any men dressing as female to perform??? so, does that mean the 2 guys on the right are drag queens? yeah but they dress and act like females on the show not all the time but most of the time oo In India, we used to have *Ram leela* which is basically like a skit on Ramayana every year during dussera. There, men used to act as women bc it was inapropriate for women to act in those skits so I guess its kind of a drag culture ooh interesting btw how are you feeling today viv? ayyy! I hope it comes off negative! @azula henlo 😁 How are you matey You'll be fine *gibs one cookie* oH mY _GoD_ @Beelzebub holy shit 😍😍😍 I love Baby Beel I have seen them b4 idk where Awwwwww > I got it from that show 😂

Hi I thought I’d ask about the diss post Then no one responded About Fearless Diva Twitter She thinks I wrote it @Deleted User herrow Wait *gibs cookie* > Yeah she has a rep on the Wikia site
@DaHomieDrew what kind of rep??? Yeah, too late. Got global blocked because she dragged drama into the Fandom discord and manipulated everyone into thinking I harassed her, didn’t stop arguing with someone over a lack of representation for gays and the fact that I reacted to half her comments with poop and rolling eyes emojis (the latter of which I actually did because the filthy bitch deserves it lmao) Yep But she’s not because our complaints are valid Oof Sorry I just heard about it and I wanted to share my experiences Because she knows she has power to abuse so people don’t “harass” her Yup I actually sent feedback to Fandom and several contact forms about her None of them worked 😞 It’s too risky for me to try and out her again 😭 Well lava Wow Reminds me of about 9, 10 servers I have been banned from For simply not using thier "way" *gibs cookie* Say again Adam Ie not being another mindless drone like Fearless I call her Triggered Bitch lmao Fearless Diva, a ruthless rude bitch of an admin who deserves to be thrown in a volcano https://tenor.com/view/fortnite-volcano-eruption-fortnite-volcano-fortnite-volcano-volcano-eruption-gif-14780743 She kicked me and a couple of people out of the wiki discord server because we were writing LikE thIs when she told us not to Talk about not being able to handle a joke :mmNo: Someone give me a link to this mad woman I have a few blokws waiting to pounce It's been a long time I got kicked out Never bothered to check again > Someone give me a link to this mad woman
@Deleted User I think you can find her on fandom > Hmm maybe someone else who was there can explain
@oge they were like we were rude She was like it hurts the eYEs I see :mmYea: I never spoke to her much in that server We were just typing LiKE tHIs for fun and she told us not to and we typed LiKE thIS one last time and we got kicked out And we weren't even telling anything bad regarding anyone I thought we only must have done something wrong but after that I've heard so many things about her I got banned by Diva when I tried to tell a gay man to play another game if he doesn’t like the fact that Choices’ main audience and source of profit is hetero females We didn't even get a chance XD And then she says she isn't a dictator 😂 Yeah How do I find this server a I know I shouldn’t have kept arguing but he asked for it, I didn’t ask him to ping Diva though wtf (he’s a suck up) > And then she says she isn't a dictator 😂
She is worse than Kim and admiral aladeen XD > How do I find this server a
@Deleted User I'll see if I can find a link What fandom??? Yeah I can't find the link @Deleted User , you can try the fandom @oge weren't you there in the server? I don't think I was banned, I was just kicked out but I ain't going there again I have self respect 😤 Damn that was fast Sad XD I remember the server was raided once :LMFAOdead: Few people joined and started abusing her :pleb: I gave Diva advice to take a backseat and stop assuming the worst in everything and she banned me the first time 🤦‍♂️ I'm telling you she's worse than Kim :LMFAOdead: Yeah Here banning is like execution And kicking would be... Forced labour So if anyone speaks against her, they would be executed Wth... I really triggered her it seems :LMFAOdead: I guess the other place is the fandom? I am not there in the fandom so I dunno Who gave her the authority to be a mod in the first place? I see @oge thank you Nah I'm good here and in priyudi's server Atleast there's no DICtatorsHIp :LMFAOdead: @Deleted User FD doesn't deserve cookies btw @oge link please And i don't own pc Hence why Fandom is a pain to use Yup I just wanted to edit on one wiki, I got carried away and made one edit on the Choices Wiki. Which resulted in a one week ban by DiVa for using the wrong English (though American isn’t even English by the rest of the world’s standards). DiVa fabricated a story about me “continuing to break the rules I ‘didn’t read’ despite being warned” when I got no warning 🤦‍♀️ that’s when she blocked me for six months, then a year for “HaRaSsMeNt” Someone should overthrow her I wanted it to be me 😈 but I’ve given up on Fandom. All the Central mods are tyrants Well Majority in there self obessessed SJW Feministic failure of life fan boys or girls I had to scroll up and read Oof So.. did anyone raid the server? :mmYea: Noice And you got banned? :dopeywhat: :OOF: :OOF: :OOF: :LMFAOdead: Well @DaHomieDrew better take screenshots Cos I'm about to mass ping I wanna know how long I last Yeeeeeesssss How many pings was it?? 5,6,7 Something like that I am proud @DaHomieDrew what is everyone saying?? Screenshot Please Well Do i get cookie?? Yay *takes cookie* You are best fren for eva UwU??? 🤔🤨 Your lovely for...... I don't know anything *scratches head* Henlo Cute doggo fyi He a good boi??? Roger *offers cookie* I just realised there's a lot LGBT type members in this server, unlike the other one, full of soyboy tools and saddos @Deleted User that was awesome :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: > @Deleted User that was awesome :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead:
@Deleted User oh thank you Just sent feedback to fandom again, told them Fearless Diva is still acting like the queen of the universe getting accounts blocked for no reason 😂 You know? The rude admin we like to diss? Yes Vigilance The thing about Diva is, she gets offended by everything but only if she sees it I only got back in to the Choices discord because of Jadelady. Then Diva happened because of a troll ruining my life with “a lack of choices for men, especially gay men” ugh men have everything so the argument is invalid (except gay men, he’s only right about that) Lol I just remembered I threatened to go medieval on Diva Same, only thing I agree with There could be more but then, apparently only the romance genre gets to be recycled And only if it’s hetero Even I wished for a gender of choice vampire book, and I like representing myself. It would have made a huge difference because the only vampire themed content that exists is geared towards teen girls Have you tried refreshing? I have screenshots to prove Diva did not follow her own rules Can be pox? @Deleted User seeeennndddd I’m permabanned again for nothing so.... > @Deleted User  not sure, it's very red and completely flat. I only have two and they weren't there like an hour ago.
@azula can be rashes I guess And Diva brought drama into the chat and no I can’t get in it says banned when I tap on it Raf or Bryce Bryce is all I have 😭 @oge apparently FD was dissed on twitter too https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/626222004437254176/749179462461161534/image0.png 😂😂😂 Did this guy delete his account? I can’t find him. I dunno Sorry Yeah sorry won't happen again > Did someone join the fandom server to ping everyone repeatedly
@Raven im sorry Oh 😅 > :hmm: 
> Be careful folks
> If you want to complain about other servers or members of other servers please don't do it here
@Weiss fti ViV didn't mind it Im sorry, I love how the server creator doesn't mind it and yet we have just a set of random moderators rately seen on here come up and say this 2 of them Right after I get banned And bit suspicious 3 No attitude here Your not Diva queen or anyone else Oh i get it, Your the guys from the other server And you didn't like my other pings 🤣🤣🤣 Im sorry Then why do 3 moderators pop out of nowhere While the server creator is okay with this discussion For the last How many hours 6,7 hours roughly Unless one of you is secretly, Black heart, Black Demoness or even Diva Queen herself So as far as I am aware, me and the others have broken no rules and your just seizing a personal vendetta via admin abuse or a poor man simp 🤷‍♂️ Also i love strife spiked up saying "what other server" Gotta love admins Who couldn't ve bothered to scroll up and read Can we get back to the normal general chat please? A bit suspicious here really and very very bad acting Then we are good no need to warn me about something that doesn't exist in your head then Strife Or you don't worry your cotton socks, if the creator is okay with it I dont see a problem with the rest, do you?? Oh its not an issue, just timings and 3 of them warning me about an incident they have no clue on Thats my issue And before you say "read the rules" Viv did okay it...... As in she didn't care And besides it ended about 2 hours ago I have not disrespected anyone But yet the creator was How abput this then We all take a cookie And be happy and let this one slide No one is worried Strife And i suggest we all take cookie and let this slide And rip working on a weekend dude Grrrrrriiiiiimmmm 🤮🤮🤮 paperwork I am not capable of the smallest of that Although what was it for 👀👀 In what sorry Can i call you Howard Wolowitz *vibes* Wolowitz it is And Rae keeps saying Boss Makes me think of Metal Gear Solid > As for the rule, we still revising it so hopefully new rule will be much clearer
So much for cookies and milk No I wasn't singling out Viv, Vivs been lovely and sweet all week So like said Wolowitz no need to single her out Oh good lord 🤣 Wow, just wow A monkey is feeding a baby tiger That is so cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 Besides Leave it be Strife for the love of the cosmos, she made no mistake, she did nothing wrong At this point you sound like a power hungry bully singling someone out just because Viv was used in a point to make your argument invalid Considering no one complained, literally no one I am being respectful..... besides I am not going back to it continuously I offered to let it slide And have cookies > @Deleted User I did what
@azula I need to read that whole bit, how sre you feeling anyways regarding you know Noq Good lord no I want cookies 🍪 *eats popcorn* Hows your throat?? Make sure you haven't developed blisters or ulcers or anything Hey Atop reminding everyone why we are all missing out on I just want someone to cuddle with 😭😭😭 How Besides I have haven't done the deed since January I am dying here 😫 > Wym
@azula regarding pronoun Nevermind Im a guy No need to worry 19 Why??? Someone call the FBI again Fuck Well it was nice knowing you Strife *plays last post* Yes A Monty Python reference > Y'all hate Dick Van Dyke
@azula a name that contradicts itself cos its 2020 now and the word Dick and Dyke are the opposites near enough Well Viv has been deprived for a month So this is the end result I wonder what it would be in my position 7 months roughly 😭 And Viv Dick is the traditional name I call my friend Dick 🤷‍♂️ Like Dick Grayson Atleast its not Emo Dante The one with the silly quiff And eye shadow > *diablo*
@red hot silly pepper moron *shakes his head* Aw Kinky I suppose I don't know what to say Hey No abuse Do it Feel the power of the Dark Side Gal Bursten it Naryan that. I'll Balitoe before I Krayble!" Just fribble it Tell the Daen! Tell the Daen! Karn sky is Relfing." Gal Bursten it Karen is every girls inspiration I need a girlfriend literally someone to preoccupy my time Im about morse code the convo Cos I'm bored Well my brother just felt the wrath of boredom Spammed more code I have loads of choices loves 🥰 Gasp
Is that a felix emote I see :profsmile: I'm playing fe3h rn lol.
Going for the male Byleth x Yuri ending with Crimson Flower route :DimitriSmile: GD is unfortunate bc its basically just silver snow
AM is prolly my favorite route tho ngl Hey BE said yes to the gays Gay as in gay guys lol
All the gays are tied behind BE not counting Yuri ofc Two Jeritza is route locked It still counts bc CF is a BE plotline and you can't get him playing AM/VW Gilbert still pisses me off tbh
And Alois
It's not fair bc lesbians don't have any platonic supports ((with Byleth)) but its always the gays that have to be platonic :SetethCrying: It doesn't help that most of the gay male options follow the pretty gay guy trope either.
Maybe Jeritza being the only exception.
Hopefully they do better in the next game What happened I am exhausted > I still have covid apparently 👁️👄👁️
@azula noooooooooooooo 😭😭😭😭 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 oop my dad used to remember directions by going somewhere once until google maps became a thing now, he only knows directions to his daily commute oh definitely Google maps was shit where I lived before. Now I live in the national capital so its mostly reliable hell, it didn't even know the roads near my house and had wrong entrances to beaches feeded I remember my dad having to drive about 200m in reverse (along with 2 other cars) because google maps effed up We were going to a beach and google didn't know the correct entrance in 2017 Idk if it got any better since I moved in 2017 (that incident happened a month before I moved XD) Hey giys What did i miss 😭 The full LGBT has almost 21 letters That's why it's called LGBTQ+ I suppose LGBTTQQIAAP There's more I can't find it :eyez: Bobs :LMFAOdead: :LMFAOdead: What about ||vegana|| Henlo Hry guys Hello@DaHomieDrew Awwwwww 😭 @azula all I can offer is virtual hug 🤗 *gibs virtual hug* @azula you alright??? Merry Christmas 🤔 Daamn Christmas for so many months sounds soo cool! Noice Fight for smell @azula check and see if you dont have oral thrush PUBG BANNED 😱 Not that I play it but still 😱 Yea In India Lemme rephrase it PUBG BANNED IN INDIA 😱 #current-events-talk @azula sure @azula please say hooman Has that worked 🤔 Do you wanna DM me?? Okay Oh i see Heres a question Why Why does he want the money And no your not an asshole for saying no I work alongside Soldiers who are like my brothers to the core But sometimes if you can't You can't And Electronics and vaping??
I do Warhammer often, and its expensive but I never ask others for money Cos Viv, you like a level headed kind person and you care for a lot for people, but you have to factor in things Remember hes much older ^^ Shoot away the question 😌 The language spoken by Bangladeshis is the mother tongue of the people of few states of India, so yeah some Indians can understand them but not all :WTFthonk: And dw @azula  it wasn't dumb, many people from Bangladesh kinda get triggered when foreigners identify them as Indians It's kinda like saying all Asians are Chinese Yeah what's up with that? 🤷‍♀️ If a person comes from a specific state/country it might mean they prefer to be identified differently It's personal preference isn't it? Which? Asians Before I entered the internet I thought that Asians meant the people of Asia which includes people from Japan China South Asia middle East turkey etc Then I got to know that Asians refer to only countries of east asia Same :pleb: The world is so confusing Heh yeah Yea Hindi
Urdu
Punjabi
Pashto
English
Arabic Those are my languages wow, that's a lot Which English? American? English is English Wtf Noah Oh. There's several versions of English though, British, American, Canadian and Australian etc not to mention different dialects in each Same, can't stand some American accents as a British person @azula makes sense @Deleted User English is English We have different Dialects and slang her doesn't mean we call it Scottish English Wait Scar is British? Wasn't that only on the first half of the film? > No offense to Michael Caine
@Strife Micheal Caine Yes @Strife Micheal was the best Alfred @Purplesim I live Trump to be fair @YukkiMons hello We haven't met before gheghegheghe Pubg used to make me even more angry That's amazing to hear!! Congratufreakinlations Viv!:dopeystarey: I'm banned from the spoiler channel Sorry Oops I meant server sorry I know Is it the same with usernames too? I changed mine recently and previous messages don't change the username immediately. That would explain it, thanks for the info, I'm new to chatting on Discord. Sorry, I'm new to chatting so if I seem rude or argumentative just remember not to act on it, okay? I'm not rude in the slightest, nor do I go around blaming people. No I'm not Never mind, I really just don't like drama or blame deflecting, hope you understand. Got it, gonna go give them a read now in case there's specific ones for this server. So yeah, I'm gonna be wary of rule 13 Can we discuss other visual novel apps in this channel? Yay! Anybody got My Story? Damn, I was hoping I'd be able to talk about it somewhere but no one seems to have made any subreddits or discord servers about it. Me either Depends on your definition of make up for what they did. Chapter 10 definitely changed, dunno what though, || chapter 11 may have originally had Rafael die but no worries, he survived || I still need to mine for it 😭 lASt one! I normally don't like the color green but the shade of green of the new attuned role slaps.

Me aka Drew Drew. DaHomieDrew Nice to meetcha not yet OMG YASSS RAY JOINED US yeah I took one too yayyy DaHomieDrew and DaHomieDrew are typing lol ikr yeah 😦 rip So, sometimes we can highlight all the funny moments the sever has in one channel and it will be a place of memories kind of a hall of fame we all if a message gets x ⭐ reacts (where x is a number the staff decides) it lands on starboard in spoilerland, the number is 3 so if 3 people think its funny and deserves to be in hall of fame, starboarding does just that yeah the staff can decide what is an appropriate number I can write an entire thesis if that's what it'll take for you guys to change the decision UwU I just starred 2 comments here whatchu mean not really, the messages landing there will be the same messages in other channels. So, if you are moderating other channels, you don't really need to moderate starboard and you can set the number high to prevent controversial stuff you never know you just need to find the sweet spot which is 5 Hey hi! I read the chats about starboard okay. How about we have a vote? It is while fail Whole I had it in my server and it started starring all messages that means you didn't set it up properly ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I was offline those i saw it after a long time I didn t set it It is in spoilerland, the RP server and feenie's server I can set it up ~~but its really simple literally anyone can set it up~~ we can test it out for a week? if its a fail, feel free to remove it That would be great just don't give people ability to message there because Yeah it never works right memories There are good members if you want to check out, you can see spoilerland's starboard I know how it works and all But i think we should have a poll ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Who created the server? I won't say anything further. I told how it'll act as highlights for new members to know about the server and as a time capsule to reminisce for old members. Now it is up to the staff to decide but pins have a limit and its up to the mods whether they want it pinned or not I was just remembering the time Where everyone in the server dmed Me about a bot and when it didn t work everyone was begging me to get it out Okay Anyone watching kbc? KBC is indian who wants to be a millionaire It s an indian hindi quiz show Idk that existed The english version of kbc Since Indian reality shows
KBC : Who wants to be millionaire

Its trashing with valid reason dw It is on Indian netflix I will check later right on the front page where they suggest shows My mother has blocked netflix due to exams that's fair you can watch it after exams Yeah I don t watch during exams will take about 2 weeks give or take depending on your binging capacity I can watch 1 or 2 ep per day oh then 50-100 days 40 mins and 100 episodes it doesn't feel that long ngl keeps you on your toes Oh wow High five it has a surprising amount of mystery given its a romantic show Ours are going since 20 aug will end on 10 oct also the characters are fleshed out and everyone has flaws and good things about them IKR yeah. Good luck Janvi and Firework UwU Results are coming Side by side oh that must be tense Like after a week or 2 or 3 days JtV has cliches but the narrator mocks them Thanks the best part about jtv is the narrator Same to you In india, it is also on amazon prime And it is nit blocked for me Not ooh that's cool Yeah I just checked I gtg and have dinner ttyl. alrighty! Have fun! can I play it on laptop? ooh can you please gimme a link I never played it oof aww rip. I can't use an emulator.

I love both but beneath just felt cooler to me bc it was actually a decent ghost story. Actually same.
Was a little late to the voting game lol.
Kinda wished the time was a little more than 24hrs but eh. Eh I disagree but its whatever. No Welcome https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/751469976359141417/761606243345235978/unknown.png AAAHHH IRIS IS INFECTED BY THE AMONG US SYNDROME yo! welcome to da cool kidz club! what's your fav book and LI? Oh how much I love me rn this one didn't fit in condensed mode so I shortened it a bit hehe thanks That is odd what if you get a cut, bleed out what they will do? Anyone can make a mistake Look at the very end it is kinda sharp Yeah they can but is that mecessary? Oh yeah That's good Yep Welcome Lanaya! I think Elizabeth shall outlive Harry too :WTFthonk: I was just reading a harry styles fanfic on wp and Elizabeth reminded me of the queen now i can t get their picture together out of my mind I am so used to seeing Mara in green that her current colour stands out lol yeah lol. Only thing I remember from quizlet were those quizzes the class took.
I remember one time a teacher told us that if everyone participated then he'd buy us pizza.
It was nice and the only time the senior class acted like they had sense I had like three pizza parties in my last high school b4 I graduated.
The last one I had was dope bc the teacher bought cake as well.
It had buttercream frosting and I even scored the last piece lol. omg cute Done @maiishirogane Well atleast it's the entire class in your case :LMFAOdead: We do the same thing But we chat on whatsapp group As if we type in the chat teacher can see it you can use VIP to binge old books and VIP books are interesting ngl. The writing is better than current non-VIP books answer teleportation plus ability to never get tired oh like that mine would be super speed because I always run away from everything 🤔 I mean I do like tech lol that would be awesome ngl mhmm I'll be the next tommy phelps. BOOM BOOM BOOM! if its gonna rain, shouldn't we stay in our houses? instead of evacuating them? 🤔 why would *anyone* wanna be slime tho viv would have... 🤔 ooh I can see that kyo would have the power to turn his art into real objects. Like draw a sword then bam! a sword appears lol agreed https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/751499648782434435.png?v=1 Techzilla? see? @MaralinaSakura I AM CUTE and its not just my pfp mara says I am evil 😢  Am I evil viv? wut yes yes I am cute thanks If she's just one yr old, I don't think it really matters tbh What they *can* do is figure out a way to keep the baby stuff in house without having to give up the "studio". Like maybe shift the crib in their bedroom and the playpen in the living room bruh If the kid is like 7+, I can get the need of them having their own room but younger than that, I really don't think its necessary what the- 14k INR just to advertise. That's some clownery right there like I get investments is a thing but dude, you ain't gonna get fruitful returns by investing on IG wut well, I do think that she needs to be called out for not actually taking care of her baby and prioritising IG over the kid. But the room thing feels too much. But that's just me *cries in still not having my own room* I sleep with my mom and brother yeah ehh I mean I do keep my laptop in other room so I kind of have a room but anyone can come in anytime and I don't sleep here so...
> Oh what Priy isn't an only child
Yes viv. I have a brother who's 11. I mean, props to her for managing the pain while she applies makeup I guess o that makes more sense bruh 😂 yeah especially those who influence with beauty and aesthetics and shit yeah but he's a handful mhmm he hates me to the core 🥺 Idk I am very innocent 😇 I am late but i don t have my own room just a different bed Being 12, i can t, i want to but Yes same here I just started Desire and decorum Idk I just got VIP so I can read older books ngl.
The actual VIP books aren't really my cup of tea The flatness can be overcome by shading I can show you what I can draw ~~tho I am pretty sure y'all have already seen it~~ 🙃 My rourke fanart was a masterpiece XD It's something and sth is better than nothing #art-channel I just tried a pumpkin cheesecake for the first time.

Hold up i didn't think that the maybe app had a male mc for one of there stories. 
Imma have to check it out to see if its legit.
Only turn off is how realistic the art looks ngl 👀
My only gripe with Episode these days is how you cant just read any book you want.
Gotta get through all the bad shit you dont wanna read to get to the good stuff Yeah, from the last time I played episodes it was like
You have to read x amount of chapters to unlock more books.
And the lineup starter books I got really wasn't my cup o tea lol Ooh I'm reading what's your story as an alternative.
Its kinda like a choices and episode knock off.
I really like how there's more options for character customization too, compared to choices.
I'm reading a super hero book atm I thought episode discontinued that?
I remember seeing a bunch of complaints about that from the YT fandom :CatBlush: Lmfao.
Hes legit going to a club Its not an everyday outfit The shades were off a previous outfit 
And he looks fine to me:DimitriShrug: I Idc what y'all say lol.
I love the outfit for the occasion In the story. Hell ive worn an outfit like that irl, its not even bad at all I was going to a club too.~~just a different kind a club~~
It was fun, no big deal lmfao.
Plus I looked hot af in it too :DimitriShrug: Hi guys So Guess who got a Fever One day I will have legendary flairs on reddit like this one. It's impossible to be mad at viv Idk how to play :/ ok lemme grab my phone then OMG YESSS I would love a book with no LIs IKR tru MW2 when :/ We already have the official cover just need some more sprites and a script yup Let's spam PB for MW2 what would be the age range? ight. uhhh how about Aurora and Tom (ILITW Tom) ~~Ethan~~ jkjk I feel like we have more people in the range of 23-30+ in choices I forgot how he looks :/ ,im choices VOS male MC oo handsome but a lil' old imo ~~drake~~ o.0 I like that suggestion but he'd stick out cuz he's 2d ~~or we can include him and viv can insert a dialogue where someone comments on how flat he lo-- nvm would be offensive~~ QB Benji stalker creep I suggested tom XD hmm Sienna is cute and also looks young Zoey 🤤 ZOEY tho 🤤 sounds good 👀 > 1.3% im bengali and pakistani lmao
@azula khoob bhalo 😛 I know there's a movie on Eurovision which has a song by demi lovato > idk what that means but yayyy
@azula idk either tbh XD I think it means very good ~~Michelle Nguyen~~ is any of them a doctor? 👀 oop. It was worth a shot tho aww thankyou Wasn't mtfl edited to specify them being 18 to qualify for sex scenes? They did the same thing to ROD I feel like they underestimated the time it takes to make those final touches and daily release is a headache for them That is why they are taking breaks every once in a while It's similar in India too. But it's more like private colleges don't give a shit to your marks and stuff as long as you pay the money. Public colleges however have a centralized test and counselling procedure. Heya welcome to da club So, what's your fav book and Li? Ooh nice No Not compulsory but you can learn if you are interested Aww Dayum Zndjamanak Yes I have seen this one Smart I just recently bought a keyboard because my brother took instrumental instead of music or dance Never seen one :/ It's catching dust because no one has played it in a month Also shoutout to my mom for making the cover Oh boy I can imagine Reminds me of Durga Puja ngl It's a festival mostly celebrated in west bengal @Deleted User can explain better bruhhhh durga puja is amazing here the entire city becomes a tourist attraction during the festival > What that
@azula its a festival :mmYea: noice ...so bangladeshi? Since Bangladesh used to be east Pakistan unfortunately due to covid there are some restrictions this year otherwise its amazing Bengal was divided into east and west bengal, east bengal became Bangladesh and was operated by Pakistan until it got independence and became a separate country west bengal remained in india West bengal is in india Ye Idek what was Pakistan thinking trying to operate a place that's so far away tbh. It got really difficult for them to deliver weapons and food to east pakistan/Bangladesh. Since they couldn't do it by land (le india was in the middle) they used to do it by sea. There is this movie called ghazi attack that talks about it in detail It is supposed to be based on true events but there was masala added to it to make it enjoyable it came from the british tbh but then it was their mistake to agree with it True does anyone want to play Among us rn?
Me and my brother are playing rn
server code - europe - EHEHQQ @DaHomieDrew wanna join?\ np aww yeah Oof. We played at spoilerland and it was so fun XD yeah I just asked if anyone wants to play, voltra and kaleen ageed and played oof lol. its fun but only if you know the players imo makes the betrayals personal XD ~~lookin' at you viv~~ mhmm same I never host the matches lol so idk ...I barely get to do the tasks whenever I start a task, someone reports a body or calls an emergency meeting partially public. Like I knew 3-4 people but rest were strangers the first day I played with viv and gang, I didn't know we are supposed to do tasks I can play tonight I think cool Am i the only one who's obsessed with how the characters move? lol.

@azula Nahhh I am the "lol nope" if its CS HW, "Bold of you to assume I did HW if its other subjects (except biology) and "wait we had hw?" if its bio hw I usually know about my homeworks but biology class was so boring, I never paid attention and never knew what work we were supposed to do the next day, teacher would ask where's my hw and I would be like - uhhh was there bio class yesterday? Social Science was like I knew everything yet I wouldn't finish my work and made excuses the entire year In 9th grade, I always completed my english work late. It wasn't until a month before school year ended did I realize I never sent my notebook for correction math was highly mood dependent for me I was that nerd who never shared her hw no matter what oof same Try episodes But it's very hard to get keys and diamonds Like EXTREMELY hard hi everyone > fav book and LI?
@DaHomieDrew High School Story and I chose Maria because I'm a Straight Male and I chose a Male MC I don't see any virgin vs chad memes of choices books > huh?
@DaHomieDrew Never heard of "Virgin vs Chad" on Reddit? besides Choices I also play Strategy Games, LA Noire and Sims 4 Strategy Games: Crusader Kings 2, Europa Universalis IV and Total War Series The antagonist on Most Wanted looks like Trevor from GTA 5 😂 It's my 1st time here on this server anyway I did follow some catholic servers cuz I'm Catholic and some political servers WTH I think it's banned to express those things here > grab some #roles and you'll gain access to more private channels
@DaHomieDrew But I did that already > well your profile still says "No Roles"
@DaHomieDrew Maybe I need to try it again > We don't like talking about religion or politics in depth because this is a game server
@azula I know and I won't talk any of those topics here don't worry 🥰 Anyone here play Sims 4? I filled the reaction roles now @DaHomieDrew where do you come from? @azula how did you know? That's me > I live in the Philippines
@azula Chad @azula is there a brownout in PH rn? Parma, Italy No, a filipino who moved here > Ahh how long ago?
@azula 4 years ago Oo, bakit? Kasi andito pamilya ko @azula yup @MaralinaSakura hi @azula really? No floods on your area either? > Wala naman sa manila
@azula bumaha sa probinsya naman, Marinduque. > Omg Marinduque???
@azula yup @вера I know one word that I got from counterstrike: Cyka Blyat Idi Naxui I also learned the word KURVA BLYAT And the word MALAKA @azula you said that you are half-filipino? I assume you have european blood > No haha I'm chinita
@azula naalala ko na naman ang kanta ni Yeng Constantino nung 2013 O CHINITO 20 years old > College ka na ba
@azula high school pa rin Kasi late ako ng year nung lumipat ako dito Hindi na ako papasok pa sa Univ. kapag tapos na ako Sabagay nasa Technic Institute ako nagaaral > Ah san ka magtatrabaho
@azula sa Office > Magastos pa magcollege dyan
@azula no shit, literally true @azula mas maganda pa server dito Kasama ako sa Traditionalist Catholic Server pero may mga neo nazis sa server na yun > The job market and economy is hella complex and even with a uni education, it was hard
@DaHomieDrew bruh, I'm taking IT at high school Oh shit @azula I was saying he said that he is a National Socialist and H****r did was a racial realist not a racist 😡 @azula although the moderator said he allowed civil disagreements that's why they are tolerated and he also told me that a lot of people on that server don't agree with them @azula I don't know if should I leave that server, some of their opinions make me uncomfortable @azula they would just post the hell they want thinking that they are on Stormfront or 4chan /pol/ > Discord is supposed to be fun
@azula it's also supposed to be a hub for gamers > Yeah exactly
@azula I only wanted to just reconnect with fellow traditional catholics on any server 😢 I didn't expect I would find many haters I'm a Catholic who wants to go to a mass in Latin language > Religion causes a lot of... nasty stuff. And in Russia ortodox Church is a cesspool of reactionary bullshit and tries to get a grip on government's throat.
@вера just like ukrainians and georgians said, PUTIN KHUILO Alalalalala @вера so elections in russia are always rigged? OMG, Everyone is discussing politics and religion here cause it's all my fault 😫 Anyways, anyone tried here to chat on Omegle? So much games > Omegle seems like a way to get unsolicited dickpics, tbh.
@вера lol, they always ask me M OR F 😂 They are nothing but desperate lunatics @вера let's request pewdiepie to play choices Or XQC Ive decided to try and download episodes again.
Turns out, YT community was high, the creator stories are still there but the catch is you pretty much have to pay diamonds to see them.
There's even a fair amount of male MCs, but I have a feeling that most of them gonna be straight. morning everyone 🌄 > New pfp
@azula Nice @azula Online ka parin? 😂 B R U H @Strife Never saw you here last night I recently joined last night @Strife HSS is my favorite book although I hope they would make a Naruto type of novel @Strife This server is better than 4chan /pol/ There are a lot of myths regarding 4chan @Strife There are a lot of antisemites there just like Stormfronters it is a hub of the alt-right Damn @oge you scared him away Hey what happened here when I was gone? Ciao a tutti Ciao everyone https://imgur.com/gallery/yhJGRpH 😌 Indeed hello everyone @azula Hello @Rayvenrock Hello @Rayvenrock any favorite book on choices and favorite LI? Nice @Rayvenrock What about HSS? Hi, um, is this the official Choices server? I was? Ah, well, it’s good to be back. Good evening everyone @oge Sup Hello EVERYONE The actual hell.. Apart from the bs ads I think I'm actually starting to like episodes lol.
The community stories are kinda interesting and there's a lot of customization options Ikr.
I could spend hours just customizing my MCs if I wanted to xD. Episode not episodes Goodnight everyone Yes, throughout the book you plan one wedding, but the rest you just spend diamonds to avoid disaster/make it more memorable My new color Me too (Pendergast!) At least Simon and Lindsay are babes 🥰 Did you know you only get bad luck if you’re superstitious? Otherwise it doesn’t work on you. I know, I’ve never had bad luck so for that reason I don’t believe it Guess the Choices books from these copycats 🤦‍♀️ It's a group of people from west india How in the world would you have an ancestry like that :WTFthonk: :WTFthonk: :WTFthonk: Weird North east and Bengali I can accept But Gujarati and pakistani are odd Coz it's waaay north True This video creeps me out guys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c66w6fVqOI their videos still creep me out even a video while driving at night That is why never watch creepy videos at night ☝️ ☝️ ☝️ It's been almost a month since I played choices :mmYea: True hello, thank you Good luck benji 🙂 You're a nice character in some of the books heh Except for that ^ He's fine 🙂 Same here. Welcome! Please get colors from the #color-role-channel Gotta face the inevitable huh Chatroom's closing Well, for chat at least Posts still up there Those who doesn't know about the Chatroom will barely notice Until the meta post came Loving this MPC colour The Double Tap Basically replacing by groups Anyone can drop by the chatrooms Compared to the recently introduced groups Discord can be confusing for some at first. I still feel new after months of using it (returning user) Actually I have some concerns regarding colours. Some unreadable The darker colours Yeah especially red, 30 & 32 Yeah dunno about that, but it's dark alright. Light grey if I call it? Still doesn't read that well Hopefully it's not Wait, did mods change or something I recall it was someone else a little earlier Wow that's Platinum levels of drama For reals Oh, that JB guy huh His songs are uh.. okay. Not bad as compared to past but still JB songs are okay nowadays imho just.. yeah decent. Okay no more trashing now I mean, can't we all be fans for someone? Artists be inspiring other artists Chris Evans has lookalike in MW I mean there would always be people screen grabbing without permissions Thanks @oge. How have you been? I am good Glad you remember me Hi thanks @egg Thanks @azula They got over today I being lazy didnt change it Thanks. Finally free for 1 month Then finals Yeah But according to me, they will be online Thanks Idk i will change it Yeah, i remember all these channels I have a board too Yes Thanks Yeah *coughs* why did they think that? Hi guys. I'm new to this server (and Discord). Anyone else from reddit? My gosh what...
What did they do to drake?
Or
Does drake have an even uglier twin brother Liam looks
Ew then
I really think its the lips that make me seriously dislike how both Drake and Liam look lol Or Hazel I chose Asian Liam for that reason.

Didn't like the creepy teeth either. I was about to say "whatt" but then I saw "reportedly". @Brookley Spark the teams software sucks on that like it reflects teachers dont understand. This happened to me before but i was able to convince the teacher I thought "electrocution".. sorry. Definitely read it as that at first glance.

Elocution: the skill of clear and expressive speech, especially of distinct pronunciation and articulation Mafs Yeah its not enough Damn We never had prom :ConfusedCat: Sounds fun :WTFthonk: :LMFAOdead: Most of my female  teachers were my mom's age so i didn't :dopeywhat: Damnn.. I'm glad I graduated school before the whole thing started tbh, my classmates were wild and would've done something stupid 
But only plus side to online classes is getting to stay home isn't it? Okay but same.
Its my one fear of home schooling too I have doing online classes since the start of april Amd they are the worst Yep. True Here people now are being jailed and fined a large amount For not wearing masks I can understand some ppl
I know a few folks who can't breathe with a mask on.
My friend with asthma gets screamed at when he tries to use his inhaler outside. He just chooses to never leave the house now so he can use his inhaler in peace Yep And sometimes even more What do surgeons have to do with ppl who have disorders tho I'm not an anti masker fyi Not everyone can tho that's my post Point No shit
Most ppl with disorders do stay at home I'm not saying its OK to endanger others either .. I'm not used to it It gets annoying when I'm working And all them life hacks to get around the fog is utter bs You work in the hospital? Yeah its the new normal I take it off as soon as i come home If i ever go out Ive been doing this since the whole mask thing happened and I always take em off the second I come home. @Arzaylea  oh you are doing great work. Good luck for the future 🦆 Q U A C K 🦆 I want to say we may forsee another hiatus again, for the final 30+ chapters.

Basically 132-150 chapters Who will play a book this long? Yeah. I am diamond mining it right now. Not paying attention to a single word. Sorry but i recently joined again what happened why is he  leaving? Because finally done with Choices, being active from 2017-2019 Nice knowing from you :).

He thinks it's a seating area huh hi hey/ How are you @carloslevuh welcome Ms. Match? 😲 Yes, that's the new UI update (I got it from 2.7.5) I don't like the new thin fonts in general Makes things unreadable Aesthetics wise it's fine, but readability?

I'm so glad I still have sweet tea at home lol 100% homo right here cool Hi, I'm new to the server. My name is Austin/Emmi/Typh. I'll explain. I identify as bigendered, which means I feel like I'm simultaneously male and female, so I have names for both based on what someone is more comfortable with and then Typh is just a nickname. I'm a big fan of lot of the works of Genius despite the fact that My Dragon Girlfriend exists. I also currently have three full let's plays of Genius games uploaded on my channel. Who's your fave Love Interest? What do you mean by LI? Oh, love interest, ok Just look at my username and profile pic I meant for Choices Now I'm confused Your fave Choices Love Interest is....?

I miss my friends, i have forgot their names,faces Same I like to go out But my parents won't let me But without a mask, that means when the virus ends My ears hurt, from wearing them Not that bad Only if I fall asleep then it gets wet And we have to wear it, even when we are in a car With family, so cant fall asleep I havent So i rarely get out Since COVID started my grandma now started going grocery shopping once a week I mean, i wear masks but clearly not liking them the faceshields give me a headache 😂 What the heck I understand with farm animals Are you looking these up? I don't like that fact The thing with the handglider? They still do reruns of Sam and Cat? I'd watch it Sadly my TeenNick channel doesn't work I disliked that show It was Hot Culture maybe? Yeah they should make It January then, or one of them should have released early December Welcome to the team ^ thankfully

Well no I just met you Oh I get it So.... Basically...... I like to shoot people..... and I also like to play love story romances on Choices Noice No. Well...... I am joining the Air Force Yeah 😅 No..... I mean I don't like to shoot people!
It's a joke Pls get it I think I will enjoy playing choices If I get a community like this Maybe that was missing Many of the books this year where not that good I couldn't connect with people who had same taste like me. I mean, who play games like choices India? Oh See? Add 3rd Are they both females? 😣 See???? I am a male Yes.... Thanks But..... Just look at the weird count 3 people Out of 550 And to make matter worst, I am a male I will explain Males don't really play My friend.....
The society here is *very* sexist Not in all places Yes..... My friend, I have no shame I am just telling you my situation and life here Yeah..... Exactly Everyone in my friend and family circle knows that I am a *crazy* Football (soccer) Fan. But no one knows that I also love games like Choices Everytime some one asks me what I'm playing I tell them I'm playing choices and they pretend they play even you can tell they're lying Hey hey hey!!! My parents are  *not* like that Be careful what you say. Pls it hurts My parents are super supportive I was talking about my society. Not parents Lucky you Yes Thank you Actually..... Only HSS As I told you Downloaded after 3 years That was the First book I read It reminds me of *my* high School I don't want to go through the pain of leaving my friends as I did in real life Certainly. I understand that. Just wanted some people to listen to my heart's content Thanks @LittleEzekiel The thing I love the most in choices is the key limits lol Yeah😅 What do you mean? Yes!!! Lol😂 Yes! I would end up wasting too much time 😅 Me too! It is still good Only thing is I have shifted from Android to ios So it hurts to get mod applications for Choices VIP is very good for new players I did whole maths on the amount of diamonds you can get if you buy VIP. and if you are a new player Lucky you My parents wouldn't bother Thank God.... Mexico? Your Parents are nice then Um.... Argentine living in Mexico? Lol I am #NoMessiFan Neither CR7 I play as a GK for my junior college team So obviously, I like GKs more that Forwards lol Lol I am very good at GK Saved my team I couple of times I am *insanely* poor anywhere else Anyway, RIP MARADONA 😭 Yeah.... So....... Boca? Or River? Independiente? Really? Nice Anyway, should get going. Bye . See you people later 👋 Bye @Deleted User Um... you know him? I get that Well..... I connect with John Wick because of his pain The way he lost his wife and his dog...... reminds me of how I lost someone I loved...... His personality...... Just matches mine......

Just don't provoke me...... 🙂 😂 No no I am not on business Just share a drink with me my friend Lol You're welcome ? np Can anyone recommend me any good book? For Choices ? Ok Thanks What is Li ? Love interest? Well...... If I want to be single then? Hm..... Thanks for the info What does this "Mhm" means??? Oh..... I got the right one Google was showing this 👍 I was confused..... I was like: "why is  she talking about medical term?" Ok Sorry 👍 So is it night there? 😐 Go to sleep 2.18 pm 😑 So you live in the US of A I did quick calculations in my head My time will roughly convert to 3.50 am for EST Can't help it Maths is useful for me Yeah I know So if EST is 3.50 am, it has to be somewhere near. Hence WST I am not nerd Like maths Hate biology Love Football (Soccer) 😍 Yeah..... Me too..... But I left those subjects in junior college Who led the allied forces to victory in the North African Campaign against Rommel's Afrika Krops? 🤣😂 You are dead https://media.tenor.com/images/25f4c90de7f79da2a7b407bf3b0c43ee/tenor.gif Hm.... Well..... You should socialize just enough so that someone can help you in your time of dire need How many? You are lucky you are not born in India No 1 : I love soccer. Like a hell lot
No 2 : I don't have a Girlfriend
No 3 : I am not Gay
No 4 : I am just that Guy who wants to be single as long as possible High school was the best thing that happened to me ever I am sorry to hear that Flirted with few girls.
Made lots of friends. And had the time of my life I am sorry for you @L'Belle Me? I don't know if I am gay. Or straight. Or bi. Or something else

It's just like...... I don't care Though I never had crushes on boys. On girls yeah. But never boys So I think I am pretty sure I am not Gay But I have this strange connection with anyone who was bullied or discriminated against I don't know why???? I was never bullied Thanks What I meant to say is that, even though I was not bullied, or discriminated against, I find myself having a strange connection with people who have gone through that pain I have no idea...... I think I can best describe myself as the "Quiet Kid" India is not a third world country my friend. It's semi developed.

Only thing is the people's mindset is that of a Third World country 😔 Well..... I uesd to chatter a lot..... I was in Theatre in middle and high school. I didn't have a lot of interest in theatre, I was just good at acting.
Anyway, thinking back how you put it, I don't think I will qualify as a "Quiet Kid" by your American standards 🙃 What can I say? I saw it. European squad 😅 Nice Well, I am sure I was *not* a Quiet Kid, now that I hear you lol I was such a simple man Be friends with everyone Don't mess with me and we will be fine If not......

I have only played one book on the entire game The Haunting of Braidwood Manor and The Elementalists And that's High School Story 👍 It's the only book I wish to play Well...... I don't even want to change or try a new book 😭 What can I do guys? High School was the best thing that happened to me in my life . Maybe I am able to connect with the story a bit too much....... I've played all but MW and TCATF Haven't finished Rules of Engagment and My First Two Loves Well...... I have also never had the US High school experience We also don't have that here, Prom I never went But the way your MC bonds with your Friends...... That's one thing I *did* experience here in India And change prom, and Football and homecoming to other stuffs and activities and it's a perfect re-creation Except the dating part Well I really *had* the perfect HS (By Indian Standards lol). So I really miss them...... Just take out dating Dating is screwed here Sorry Oh..... You are the independiente guy😁 A team with a rich history It did with me High school....... 😭 Barely any LGBTQ+ people here I will give anything to just live HS *again* Come take my spot Where??? I am *comming* In Toronto Canada, West Humber Not even in Canada...... 😔 That's bad Only Celebs are Kind of @Deleted User 

Well...... The population of LGBTQ+ members will remain low as most of the Earth's population identifies itself as hetrosexual. The main thing is that those who *do* identify themselves as part of the LGBTQ+ are not discriminated against That's another thing And sadly that never happens.... But there is hope! This is the first Indian movie which tells a story about a Gay couple Your fave movie/show? Um..... I don't usually see movies The last I saw was John Wick chapter 3 lol But....... This movie is the first movie in India which tells a fictional Story about a gay couple who wants to marry each other against odds And the best thing about it...... It's a commercial success! Which means people here are willing to change their mindsets Of course celebrities get it easy But..... Maybe I have some hope Hope for everyone If there is one thing I am sure I am in love, it's with my country. I just love the idea of India. Not just a country of all religions, but also a country for all people Maybe that's why I am thinking of joining the Indian Air Force 😅 I just hope it happens sometime Though something tells me I might not be there to see it when my dream becomes a reality Good luck Thank you And May you get what your heart desires @Deleted User Any got to go.

Too much pain..... Yes! That's good Actually...... It brings back memories....... Beautiful memories of my High School..... So I can say yeah..... It played a huge part in my life Mind you my High School was not tolerable towards the LGBTQ+ community But I didn't let that affect my education My friends didn't respect the LGBTQ+ community.....
But I didn't let that influence me...... 
And here I am...... Making friends with good people What? What does boomer means? @kyo 😠 I was born in 21st century Very well I wouldn't mind Lol I was Twice The only thing is...... I retaliated so bad..... I was almost kicked out Yeah..... Same Let me tell you guys my story So in 6th grade, this young boy who just joined our school started to bully me. Now I am a peace loving man. I ignored him the best I could. But he just was really annoying. He used to steal my things, spread rumors about me and all that stupid stuff. 

But one day he went too long. You see my parents gifted me a watch on my birthday and that meant the world to me. One day, that bully just picked a fight with me and broke my watch. That was the end of it.


I literally killed him. Beat him up so bad, that his parents threatened to file a police complain against me. That boy was never the same again. He never bullied me or anyone else for the matter. He left my school the next year Sorry Yes Don't blame me! English is not my language 👍 Nice ending???

Then Toyota CHR can be a good buy to save money too And gas And protect the environment 😔 In the end It's your choice And wish This one decision will remain for the rest of the book so chose what you really want to take 😝 *Choices input* What? In the meantime, I am the new guy 👍 Does someone else feels that choices is too much "Imaginary" ? I mean The stories are really stories Like this will never happen in real life Stuff like that Anyone?

He wants to be one Yes At least enough to live a life Yes Competitive mobile gaming has a huge market in India And I mean *HUGE* Yes! The trouble is the societal mindset People don't look at professional gaming as a career It's still Engineer and Doctor here 😔 You need to be graduate here In people's eyes It's like an unsung school Like you need to complete basic high school in USA, similarly you need to complete graduation here in India 🤔 Good for you Yes I want to do that I just want to visit just 2 places on Earth The first is bottom of the  Mariana Trench

And this? 😑 iNtReStInG 🤔 You girls sure have some interesting conversations...... Sorry I am a "killing strangers" Yeah That's one reason why I want to go to America for my Masters Ha ha Joking Just don't do anything to my dog And yes I want my wedding ring back Too expensive I literally gave up on my Masters in UK because of that Yeah Like MIT, Stanford don't only have high rankings, they also have high fees 😵 I haven't even started bachelors yet😂🤣 😑 Is environmental engineering a good career choice? Do u? Hm..... I don't know if I will get a job after my Masters in environmental engineering And besides I can do my Masters only from Canada And that to from McGill University only Rest all are too expensive McGill has a fee of like 15k a year Which in INR is low 🥺 UCLA sounds familiar......🤔 Oh 😅 Hello Hello @Arthurian UFO Here Which book? Should I get a dog or a cat as a pet guys? get a hybrid :mmYea: would a hybrid of a dog and cat be called a cag or a dot :WTFthonk::WTFthonk::WTFthonk: hmmmmmmm theres an animal called liger which is a hybrid of lion and tiger F theres even tigon which comes from breeding a male tiger with a female lion No......😞 i think a dog needs more responsibilities than a cat? yea Na Companionship is better I think Do cats make good companions? Um..... I prefer someone to watch my back? Someone I can rely upon? it depends on the cat but in general i think dogs provide better compaionship Hm..... I should go for dogs then doggos Doggos it is then ^^^ this is a good idea Btw this is my friend’s cat in the pic 😅 Sure Thanks for your advice guys :pleb: Um..... I have another question. How do you get the 18+ tag ? Um..... Aren't u a staff member? Wow. I never knew But u a dog U r They can't? iNtReStInG Lol can u pls give some reasons? @oge Ok.... I will sure look into it Thanks In Canada? There is scope for it? If I come for masters? But.... what if my bachelors is not in environmental engineering but in related field like chemical or oil/mining Will the work experience then count? No no I want to be an environmental engineer But the thing is The country where I am, has no scope for environmental engineering Oh god no I think u misunderstood Pls listen me😅 Yes... Yeah But I have to come for masters Yeah.... all environmental engineering jobs require some work experience in the field So if I get my bachelors in related field like chemical or oil Then work for say 4 years Then apply for masters Then complete my masters And search for jobs Will my 4 year experience in a related field count? Ok.... How about a masters in chemical engineering with a focus on environmental? Is that good? No no Just job Like I did my bachelors in chemical Isn’t environmental specific? Um.... What do u suggest? And how? Seriously? There is scope? Oh no.... 😅 So..... What should I do.... Bachelors in chemical? Or bachelors in oil? My first step towards my career..... In that case, CS is the most stable option 😅 But I suck at tech Like real bad My dad just cares about quality He doesn’t worry *what* I study Then oil vs chemical vs civil 1. Oil 
2. Chemical 
3. Civil In this order U just talk like my dad 😅 Oh yes! I am a jack of all trade, so my interest is very diverse Don’t say that to my dad 😝 Yeah..... me too Oh no 😅 My dad is an electrical engineer Now he runs his own business In trading mobile phones 😝 Sure “Dad” 😝 Nice way to categorise I think the same goes with bachelors But if it something I love Then I will do it Hm..... Hell no I am an Indian. We guys are like *forced* and *drilled* to study 😅 Yes...... Cause usually we are *forced* to study something we don’t like I have soo many friends who are preparing for exams for bachelors they don’t even like Yes I am lucky to have a  family that gave me the freedom to choose my passion Hence what I am preparing for is on my own terms And not forced upon Sure sir Good day And thank u It was a pleasure 😦 :YellingWoman: :shifty: Which is why I'm glad I've never owned an iphone so I can have unlimited diamonds Me but with FA and DS lol

Weird thinking:
Why can't discord allow **more than 8MB on all files?**
Like, posting vids, sharing files and images.
*sorry! this filesize is too powerful* can't it be like fb compression for images? ..marketing strats. Well, we can use imgur heh still.. image compression technology though Phones are increasingly getting larger in pic size, no dice sometimes heh. *You're a shooting star.. everytime I gaze at you...* 🤣 The song ^^^^ Yes I did that too.. still a good idea, nothing new. woah.. time really flies fast So sad the update doesn't bring any height and depth changes yet. Very postponed to a winter update aka Part 2 > Bedrock Edition: First time on part 1&2, guys? Major procedural generation changes also got postponed Nevertheless, pretty much excited on what the new blocks can do, and for creative builders. Mixed emotions about Jappa and team's accessibility changes to ore blocks. I've seen that video ! check out south china morning post's video did they ever release the cave update? its been long since i played mc so i dunno about the recent updates technically.. yes and a no. it will release on 8 june, sweden time. the blocks and items can be gotten through alternative forms. the warden and sculk sensor blocks will be legit gotten in a later update. (warden postponed) heh, this went blocky talk. lull https://tenor.com/view/frog-loop-frog-loop-viynl-frog-viynl-gif-18152140 :dopeywhat: :YellingWoman: :this_is_fine: im hungry now :e_minor: why though? meat in excess is certainly not healthy but ocassionally its fine yea and beef increases cholestrol also a lot even goat and pork i think chicken is lighter among them :OOF: you might be reborn again 😌 i have never eaten indonesian food but i'm a fan of chinese food i dont think we get traditional chinese but i like the fusion no we get like indianised chinese food , like chicken manchurian, hakka noodles etc etc 😩 np! you should try mutton then lul internal racism is way common within communities than you think btw so its not much of a surprise anymore hmm maybe because in china the people are not exposed to the outside world? idk mhm if you dont mix with other communities that will happen china has become numba 1 though O_o tru tru no one messes with china now 😤 yea ye imagine saying this in china 👀 yus name the frog forg anyone has tried out the ruined bastions thingy? yeah like.. the sheer scale of it is .. kinda majestic .. and very imposing Oof: Reddit is down?

Well, a teaser of it. Thoughts?
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11 Never say it's the last version again, MS. Heh.
At least Apple doesn't say that on their macOS. A fellow friend sent me over this... There's no updates yet, just a teaser for now, like I said.
Also, Start button is moveable!
I really hope other icons can be as well, such as the touch keyboard icon. It's looking more like macOS now with the Spotlight-esque Start and Search And ability to snap for more varied grids? Nice for large screens. And ... Android apps? I hope it is as advertised but ...oop. via Amazon App Store. No Choices in there. https://youtu.be/CtmdUiv_sxs :shabib: Now I miss Laws.... whatever divisive thoughts we have. doin fine how abt yall uh, welcome 📱 __iCarly 2021:__
> "In 5, 4, 3..." -Freddie, old iCarly intro
The new iCarly is out! Any thoughts about this new show?
• It is set several years after the events of the old iCarly.
• The internet has changed a lot.. makes me realise that.
• More adult themes are also planned alongside the classics, still as interesting as the old one.
• Character "Sam" is replaced with an LGBT best friends character, Sam departure story is explained in the first episodes. (IRL, she's not in the 2021 show)
• There's Millie, the adopted daughter

New intro in #multimedia-shabang Media moved to #multimedia-shabang as per rules Hi use that bug zapper so satisfying to zap those evil things :very_angry: Random talk:
Which anime shipping is best for Ash Ketchum?

I dunno, I no longer see the appeal of Win8-fied flat emojis anymore... I've been wondering when they'll ever update them.

Discord threads is out! Thoughts? This server has it by random The hash icon Mobile users may need to update though... not sure using desktop rn I don't think we can use it I mean, it was designed to declutter "off-topics" No, i mean the point there ^^^ Discord ideologies are weird. I feel like it should have been like, a way to express specific topics. Without being archived, timed or whatever. *lost the opportunity there* Point, okay still valid. The only issue I have is we can see private archived threads

That Jaz guy is here too? Man, will this ever stop. Loving this server too, by the way 👍 Loving all Choices servers. There's a Belvoire server too? Very much thanks 👍 No, I don't know him. I came to know him via reddit's CSYP post to @Nikki_2406's server. Which has since been deleted or hidden. ...I don't @azula . It was because of the reddit post which got deleted now after revisiting. And from there, @Nikki_2406 told me everything. She said CQJoker the redditor, was Jaz. Don't you guys have global bans or something? No problem. You know how it is. Yeah, thanks. We don't need toxic Redditors like him. He can stay back on Reddit if he wants to. The CSYP invite, which like i said was hidden or deleted Okay, maybe let's not talk bad stuff anymore. Sorry for intruding there. *basically that Jaz guy is off the turf*
*the Redditor, the bot* gamer guys toxic Guys, you're right, I was *Jaz.*
