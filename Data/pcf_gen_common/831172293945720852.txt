Or she chose non Lis endign "Discovering the Love" PB's latest book Also MC has this electricity thing going on with the "show you around guy" Because probably that person is a eros bot without any insulators "You are amazing , Mon Cherie"
" We have to inform polizia" because surely bilinguals throw random language word (I mean we do.. but not like that) And we'll meet our not so forced LIs parents even if we hate em More like #nightmare-books but ok lol This is the most educational server lol *the plot thickens* Thats a love story if i ever heard one.....

I refrained from watching it like all that.. that other day.. I ended up watching it and well.. it was.... The same.. This is       It depends on the invigilator  what the consequences will be... Imagine if that person is really cool and actually cuts like 2 of your marks to show that you wrote the consequence wrong for that  But most invigilator  may not be.. so yea My past year SST teacher probably would definitely praise this We have this "teachers notes" system here.. we are told to like copy teachers note ( and I hate it since I hate these things.. I do my own notes and be happy) 

Last year , my SST teacher was like " why you didn't submitter them till now" in DM.. and I was like because they are stupid. Just tell me why we would do this. We do our notes. Also we all have been stressed this past year , we don't have to do this work. And I like wrote to him a thesis of deviance lol and why we need to break this norm He was still like " it is for teacher student thing " but after that I didn't submitted those notes and at the end of the whole year , I was his fav I love this!!!!! Especially "the chronic procrastinator " Get better soon Lu *plays fight or flight* *plays relief* *plays don't stop me now* *plays freedom at last* *plays a winter in July* I mean .. that's a **harsh** topic Yea..

Is a .. new combo Not energy drink but I like to drink iced green tea dashed with cinnamon , honey and lemon Tbh I don't usually have energy drinks to have energy. I have them just for fun.. since literally anything energizes me up lol I'd rather find something which makes me.sleep so that I can sleep when I want lol V-8 sound cool .. but ain't that's what life's all about.. lol Like always ? Happy bday Rashon's Mama Idk... It's just sooo headache Tiktok is banned here.. But instagrammers also do that alot And if I stumble on anything such I'm like give me a caution just like choices Kinda same Btw I was like walking down the road once. And there was  a light flashing and I felt like very dizzy .. and I  was like I want content warning on this road And then instagrammers and tiktoker be randomly using this flashing filter I accidentally took a CS class I wasn't supposed to be in It was for others but I saw my schedule , thought it's Friday And took the class Realized after the whole class That its not supposed to be my class Oops Though I do have a real CS later on lol With the same teacher I also openly asked questions and answered thus got noticed ...  Character transparents ?

Black jackets are just something attracting I have this leather jacket.. I bought out happily...

(Oops its blue) It has something written Like "insert a motivational quote here* I forgot the quote tho Lol nope *people who lives in apartment buildings* where do we lie lol On concrete road?  Sushi never backs from a fight lol Oh but she does... *Suddenly imagined A plate of Sushi fighting another dog* Hi At midnight ? Good and you ? Id burn... At 40 celsius Cheese burger.... Baked chicken I guess ? Pizookie? Sounds ... Cool ......Cursed gifs 101 Reface? Lol Oh *searches deepfake...* Interesting AI is scary.. and interesting Hi , loaf Its pretty much that Pan is attracted to all Meanwhile bi is more in respect to the said persons gender to ... It's like attracted to same as mine and different as mine ( which is definitely not only limited to male and female) **__TL;DR__**
Pansexual is attracted to all genders . 

Bisexual attracted to genders same as mine and different to mine Both feels same and *are* pretty much same from what i know but like from different things **__Fact__** Bisexuality is actually very unclear term That's why pansexual was made Many believed being bi is being attracted to male and female But it's not that simple Pan was made to be more inclusionary... But Bi is umbrella term imo and very inclusive For me , cisgender gender and trans gender gender are no different in terms of romantic attraction because if a cisgender women is women , a trans women is also a women. They both are women. And I'm bi. Both cisgender men and transgender men are men and I'm bi. The general view is this tho But a deeper view is that bisexuality is an umbrella term At least from all I know Oospie ... wrote too much Now I'm gonna go and hide Sooo much agreeed Infact, most terms related to the lgbtq+ community are vague at times id say I'd say we should just stick with each other tbh.. Tho the terms also do need to be clarified.. more so for understanding of a non lgbtq+ person or a new lgbtq+ person Same Take care , viv Tonight or tomorrow morning at the most beautiful word of God and the colors in this universe turn on our way to know that you are interested and I'll get it now finally Yea... The text predictor is ........ Cool ....Not you again u3br... Good luck Really wanna steal your ideas now lol Dreams are really scary Also i have many dreams which repeat themselves again and again The fact that you are talking about butter the song... But non kpop people may end up thinking "butter" ... Made me crack Same Fusions are..... Weird In food ... it doesn't taste... Authentic taste I guess I'm actually okay with lil fusion Yea It's not like those who like fusions are dumb .. I'm just saying about my taste so no worries  **EXACTLY!!!!!** I feel like thoughtful is when two things which actually blend together are fused Such as maybe some mexican sauce with dumplings.. or like mexican topping on pizza Now that i think it did sound like that...  Food is to be loved... Loved by heart... Loved by brain... RIP my life.... This is sooo ||sexist|| Agreed soo much Do it in bits ? I srsly like your keyboard...... Cool Not you ub3r bot... I knew that this fun looking keyboard has to be very fun and cool  :aww:   My discord is glitching badly.... Fun.. I meant fun I like the lines near keys... It highlights keys and looks like a GBA game......... And I like it Yea Probably I guess..  Ah... makes sense..... Sometimes the standalone emoji should be smaller Sometimes it should be bigger We need options lol :bigmood: This is still small but enough Right ... It's normal now Reflection...  But this emoji it's too big Yea... I want emoji to have option size Sometimes emojis with text needs to be bigger It's def not ok Lol The sweat drop actually scares me for some reason this big .. This one is better lol Good luck tony! It's always nice to meet fellow writers... PS I'm a writer currently working on getting ideas  I love fantasy !!!!!

I also liked MTFL dad when he improved in later chapters alot Also can I shoutout to Kenna's father figure Gabriel ? *why I am literally remembering all the sad dads..* I have played TC&TF only literally halfway through ( book 2 midway)... And I'm pretty sure I'll cry on leon Fae doesn't mean in IRL... *I think* Aww Nope... Its me a lot of time.. and tis understandable Aww.. I don't basically know the reason....But hugs to you https://tenor.com/view/hug-virtual-hug-hug-sent-gif-5026057 Understandable... It must be rough It's 3 minute to be over in mine Same... Tho id say it's more a lot of ups and down in my case.. We had have our ups and downs , like lots of in a lots of time... It's ok to be I kinda relate I mean I kinda feel upset when I read about granny's and all.. since my granny ... Let's say she wasn't the best.. *understatement...* I still remember her But I .. feel sad when people talk about loving grannies It's kinda not exactly but somehow same So... It's not petty at all Feelings are *never* petty They are... Preach! And I know we can , cuz we are awesome and open minded I hope.... That we are... Same But still... I think we have went through with so much conflict of being cared for or having fight due to someone not understanding us.. I think that will make us more thoughtful for our.. future gens At least make most of us more thoughtful And willing to see the other perspective I believe so too.. we may look stupid sometimes. We may cry on really stupid things sometimes but ... We are pretty smart Same ...Well yea Same But more like they will literally have no experience of our kind of school for a while And ... They are literally getting schooled and all in an era where most countries arent even catering that education of a  good level... Or any chances of socializing It's a thing... Agreed But they have no option They also can't go to parks They also can't go anywhere Nowhere are they allowed to be Online studies take a toll on us all.. for sure I am an introvert since forever. I'm kinda antisocial but I had the option They don't.... Please do take care And I'm not someone to say... But I think Lu's advise makes alot of sense Please try to take care of yourself! *I can relate with that* But you can always mute this server.... If you want to *I just let out an breath I didnt realized I was holding* My dad is a poet ... He is pro poet and a teacher Your dad sounds like.me...

Gosh ....That's not a reason enough reasonable to do *that*? Sucks to be featured in that blog... This i kinda relate with one of my past school... It was like trashy like them but not rich like them *breathes in relaxation* My bff went to one like that She even says none cared about the classes even the teachers And it's ,lemme say, a reputed school of my country ........ ........ *Vibes are increasing of creepiness each sentence she posts* My Bff's school was literally belvoire without the T They even had the groups divided Like the mean popular , the nerdy Etc They used to gossip And she also says the classes never mattered Since teachs didn't cared somehow Oopsie Also there were like lots of show off activities in the school. People who did that were made popular And people who didn't were bullied And they literally outted each other's secrets Without a confession page ..... Lol *imagining a confession page for my HS* I have 1 Funfact is that we first talked online Seems totally you It is That's me and my friend lol That's not me and my friend... My friend says I'm too innocent for that.. *and I kinda am, I guess.. also im kinda asexual soo yea* *totally observant of ya* Lol I'm def that friend lol My friend once cracked a dirty joke.. I was like what And she was like laughing and laughing and laughing ...And was like you won't understsnd I then understood it was a dirty joke *inserts that moving eye emoji drew used* *me looking back to all my middle school friends : if only we could have been friends now...* ~~we either had a fallout and they ended up bullying me or we both left the school without closure yet we used to be the closest people to each other~~ Same *I ended up making this one person my bff and only friend since they are the ones who confirmed it too* *otherwise I always question the level we are at* Whoa! Must be nice to have friends since KG Same *it is what it is* I only had/have 2 people in my life who I ever labelled best friend *she doesn't know Kirby I guess* Nope *Kirby the swallows everything gaming character* Need not be sad tho lol *they do suck* *stressful* Same  Relatable *ignoring how i celebrate with me and my sibs but thats not like any thing* Lol Nice Same I actually get some gift from my sis and we just eat special food... thats it & thats all i want It does...

For different reasons
To teach you different lessons - Selena G. ~~If I hadn't been excited for TE 2 theories, i wouldn't have been probably anywhere~~ Nikki , you ruined Kyo's mood.. we blame you  *jk* Thanks.. i was just gonna ask *why the mytho i turn people into stone person* Nikki, You made Rae's mood.. we forgive you  It was just a joke.. *also relatable since like a week especially* Nikki, you just told us to forgive medusa, we won't ever forgive you  Lennox , you turned this into a loop, we blame you  *it wasn't a loop before **you** said it* Lennox, you hate this loop, we don't hate it  Nikki, doesn't that mean you are in heavens? I'll check it out *Bet on it , bet on it* Then go hear double vision By sam T Or hear Young forever by BTS with english subtitles *the loop ended finally* *it was one hella scene..  kept me playing and playing ... But I enjoyed solving it* *i am more intrigued now* So headphones on Going to check it out rn Wait.... What.. just got to know Dreamcatcher is handled by Pony Canyon *in Japan I guess* I love Pony Canyon *especially  more biased due to this  certain show* Go listen to "leaked and never gonna be released  stained by Selena g" It's like... Very sad I love Endless night soo much *also I'm really weirdly a sucker for motivational songs in Japanese* Thanks for the suggestion!!!!!!! :forglove: *all love dead after creepy emoji* I relate to it weirdly................... *I need a psychiatrist damn* Vtubers? What are they? Vocaloids? Like hatsune miku? Ah~ They must be kinda annoying............ Since the vocaloids usually have this kind of tone.... It kinda makes sense to me It's just a thing Feeling attacked due to people even saying one lil thing about a fav topic is actually kinda very common nowadays And it's because of insecurities of not feeling like anyone likes you and more like people despise you I'm somewhat like that but with more I'll start self questioning and trying to hate that stuff and all Until I get sane again and realize I don't need to change myself Happened quite few times with me Her method is trying to shut to not feel like that Yea it does sounds like what I have sometimes It does just unknowingly feel like that No matter what the person had said Rangin from "i dont like it"to "i hate this" It implies you dislike it.. and it kinda does that Instead of blowing , i do start to feel like shit without any good taste  I guess it still felt enough scary or attacking enough Also with that line it kinda also sounds like she kinda also looks up to you too Agreed and understood but sometimes it's like..... Dontknow it just feels an attack for no reason I kinda relate with her so... And I don't even see things as just black and just white... Yea  It just is... When someone doesn't notice or thing and then tell you to mute it or somewhat... It likes stings especially when it's someone who looks upto you /Someone you wanna be like Out of topic now but I relate.... And like I was bullied for being kinda "feminine" according to some of my classmates And then I was bullied by my ex bestie for my accent *which is because they are jealous cuz it's pure american accent and well my teacher like it* Oops I have one I just do Lol ^ is just funny and also low-key relatable My dad hasn't gotten his #2 *he got his first in like april(?)* so I'm also very proud of my country & my country has this free vaccine campaign but guess what 
There is a high lack of vaccine so I don't think barely any people are getting vaccinated rn And the free vaccine campaign after the lack started Sooooooo TS was awesome in country phase *she is still awesome tho* That sounds like a nice one *I follow like all religions and none lol* Watched it once for 1 sec... Remember nothing. ^ is really relatable Or be cool and be edgy lol Hi ..I'm wondering who is kano from PM *not me literally answering wassup lol* Happy early birthday!!!!! Congrats!
