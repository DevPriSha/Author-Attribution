Thank you! Happy to be hereüëã I consider many of them my favourites. This is kind of difficult to answer Thank you! Current ongoing books that I keep up with is TRR Hi viv! Thank you indeed! Oh, please get well soon Thoughts and wishes with you! Thank you! I like yours too! Beautiful artwork That happened to me once too Changed my pfp too fast Exactly Computer devices for the elderly? A major problem is the problem with visual disabilities My grandfather has a problem with font size if he wants to read the newspaper or watch any sports This is a major problem since this is the only source of entertainment he has now.üòü The visual acuity loss in the elderly should be kept in mind while designing any device for them my mother is the same way she refuses to use her glasses because she insists she's young
@azula 
 that must be frustrating for you Love the new icon Sienna deserves all the love and happiness Thank you for the update.I hope it's  not what you're thinking because it's easy to think of that scenario under these circumstances. But it'll be okay Furi. Good luck üíØ 
There are people here rooting for youüëç understandable. I am glad to hear the update Oof @Deleted User good to see you  :uwu: > I wuv mara for making this
I do too:uwu: Hiya! How long is 1 episode Pri Oof I was hoping for 20 I'll have to watch after exams too Ik But BBT I liked in like 10th grade because I understood some of the science stuff, it still had some cliche portrayals though > Ours are going since 20 aug will end on 10 oct
All the best!! I only ask this question out of curiosity, is there a historical precedent for this, could they have found a way to not have royal duties and not be royals and get paid for it? The new icon is miles better than the one on the subreddit. Thanks viv You're using the wrong formula It's basic math, the perimeter of a square equals the length of one side Add the length of all the sides of the given squares and you'll get the correct answer Yes, you need to raise the power of length of one side to 2 for area, it is different than multiplying by 4 than perimeter Correct But you're multiplying the lengths and finding out the area I think Perimeter stands for **boundaries**, you don't need to bring area into that Just use, 4(length of a side) for each square and add them Yeah No worries Those help you in SAT And entrance tests in general So much this Imagine taking the SAT and knowing US is never going to let you in Lol Anyway on to more pleasant topics, I'm glad I'm studying what I am I'd have liked that tbh Why exactly do they establish student loans? I don't understand, do they not want more students to seek college education after High School? If you're not the elite class, so to speak, you're going to be in debt after you graduate and seek a job immediately and that sounds counterproductive to me. Yeah that makes sense. Education is the *means* to better ourselves. And yet they make it inaccessible Hope this changes. Aww Are you talking  about the cast? Tran Loan is gorgeous Mood. I don't mind celebrating with family but I don't expect parties on my birthday Uh why do hispanics do this? Ohh, that actually happens where I come from too. Yeah, it's funny to notice the similarities here . We don't speak of good news, tell everyone sth before it has happened for fear of evil eye. It's more of a cultural thing though and we have prayers to prevent it. I agree with the fact that we know that the other person has good intentions. Exactly Yeah I get that and I'm sorry you lost a cherished gift. I got a very valuable set of earrings from my brother as a gift for scoring high grades in an exam and I excitedly told everyone about them. A few months later sth happened to the clasp behind the ear and now I can't wear those. It's  not about the earrings or the jewelry, it's more about the memories associated with them for me. Thank you. Anyway it may be mostly superstition but sometimes I find being hesitant about sharing things works. So what are you looking forward to on your birthday? It does actually. Enjoy your day off! And the yummy food:uwu: This sounds amazing :dopeystarey: Happy birthday!! Many happy returns of the day Lu :uwu: üíï My deepest condolences to everyone. May the people who were lucky to know, love and befriend Jordan find peace and comfort and may his soul rest in peace. I'm sorry for your loss Crow. You're not alone in this, and you're sweet for checking in on Jordan's mom and it makes a huge difference for parents to know their kid was being cared for. Thanks Drew Wish someone would tell my parents that. And that's a really cute sketch üíú Differences are fun You just have to show some interest in what they want to talk about. And viola Okay so you're branching out a bit You don't have to be nervous when talking to new people,although that's valid. But I'm sure once that person gets to know you they'll like you That's so cute I'd be cool with all of them I've been there though although I didn't get involved in the fight myself but it didn't end well It's a pretty bad place to be in I'd try to be there for everyone without picking sides Honestly, it's up to you who you forgive or allow in your circle Don't judge how other people treat person A. Just see how you want to interact with them Yeah Yikes Who says that to someone's face Even if she said that jokingly,on the phone,or to another person about you. It's a horrible thing to say to someone I think You should be the person to decide what's best for you in any situation. And I'm sorry you had to hear that. You deserve better Happy birthday Rae!!
Many happy returns of the day:heart_exclamation: I'm doing great! Thanks for asking. How about you Angelaa Speaking as someone who  is just trying to understand the reason for these names,could that be because they wanted to sort of 'better assimilate' into the american community and are probably trying to save their kid from being questioned in class about where are they from? Yeah I figured I'd not want my kids to have to answer questions when they're just trying to learn and then have to locate where they're from on the map People should learn before making fun of names. Otherwise they should go back to kindergarten when making fun of names was supposed to be the height of comedy. Especially when it's a cultural thing because it shows that you're not willing to respect the other person enough to learn and say their name correctly. Oof I remember those dolls We didn't have the one on the left when we underwent training, I should look at some tutorials for that. I can see the target market for it But at the same time,way to give yourself poor posture and health problems Exactly OMG I love that show The one you used the GIF from Gravity falls Sth tells me you're Mabel Aww this sounds so cute vivüíñ Guys the best thing just happened Thanks viv Sure!

Maybe I'll 
feel the same in a couple years but right now I don't want to sound ungrateful but I would have a much better chance of learning at a hospital that has a concept of pagers, and not treating medical interns as little more than the person who fetches tea for the senior. This culture is nothing more than ego boosting Although thankfully we're taught to treat our nurses as kindly as respectfully as any senior So that's something I do like about what we're taught, we value what nurses tell us about the patient and listen to them I hope there will be good changes in the upcoming years I remember when I was a first year and had my first tour of the hospital our professor told us he'd been gently reminded of scrubbing in multiple times by the nurse in charge of the OT and he made sure never to forget that afterwards and always to remind every 3rd year class otherwise they were going to be reminded not so gently. Too bad the pandemic happened and derailed everything. Your stories are comforting for me and also the thought I will definitely get my chance someday. Thank you lu:diamond: Queen My horoscope just attacked me Anyway How's your day going Also why do people believe in astrology when people esp those who are in STEM think of it as a pseudoscience I mean I do get that feeling that I am what my birth chart tells me I am And I would never want be the one who tells people who or what to think about themselves,but I guess yeah it's fun like personality tests I have a Taurus but apparently it's in my 9th house Anyway my sun is in cancer which means I'm v sensitive and empathetic which I guess I already knew lol things do affect me a lot Hi margotmuses pl don't be scared by astrology talk I am not into astrology I believe it's a pseudoscience but it's for fun Have fun!

I'm hoping it helps people *not be scared* of getting vaccinated. Because that is a thing you see a lot unfortunately. God this pandemic better end I just want people to make better choices But yeah üò¶ Yeah I can thank the people who helped me today figure out where to go in the centre they'd set up Lol So Lu, I have a question Should I be worried about a 120/80 bp if I have both parents w different forms of hypertension ?

I did look a lot like my dad tho When I was a kid Mom hated that:this_is_fine: Anyway I should stop oversharing That's how I think of it too, and it is clear that you have a mature perspective on life Totally get that, recognising my face in the mirror gets difficult because I am a mixture of 2 ethnicities so Then it is good for me to remember that looks aren't everything and not a metric to judge a person with. A good attitude takes us far. I'm really sorry you went through this I mean Sometimes Okay bot I look at my brothers and wonder how they managed to find women to agree to marry them Like Istg Sometimes seriously I wonder if I'm a lesbian because of the men I've seen around me People born in the 90's aren't any better Trust me on it Oh thank goodness I live in a country where segregation is the norm I roomed with a girl and thankfully we kept our room clean But yeah I couldn't handle sharing space because of differing schedules Yeah but it makes for hilarity when you find out the other person liked to sleep with their lights on I invested a lot in eye masks lol These all sound like good techniques Morning my class isn't starting for some reason 15 minutes but they sent the link God I miss physical classes and actually going to college Oof one of my profs has covid :( Omg guys I love this class lol It's basically the closest thing to psychology I've studied One thing I found interesting is that they're emphasising the person's willingness to seek help Like, you can only help people if they want to be helped Critical care and disaster management I told my prof about what PTSD is so ig it impressed her Our prof is using IRL events to illustrate that :( Anyway this class and the department as a whole is so good for the feeling of not being good enough for medicine I feel sometimes Because they actually encourage dialogue, all depts do ofc, but ig I feel more comfortable talking in their lectures w/out feeling self conscious I did!!

Last time I was in denial but this time I actually worked hard So what've you all been upto Sounds funn So proud of youuuuuu Yay!! Oof But Wouldn't that have led to more complications God let me tell you what I hate, I hate that there's 1/3 people who have uterus who may suffer from pcos in their lifetime and there's still so little research done on it. Oh I'm glad you're going to be fine Lemme look what my anatomy book says but we study obs+gynae in final year and you don't need to worry at all Yeah true It's unjustified @Arzaylea  the most updated book of anatomy I have says that you don't need to worry about anything Scientists thought it may cause complications but it was never ever proven So yeah you're just a unique person That's all Yeah dw LMAO I need my anatomy grade I hate this subject Oof I know Knowing stuff made me think I was having a stroke when it was just a panic attack lol Oof I get that, she thought it was ectopic?

The professional medical  exams my country takes during medical studies are pass/fail though They keep changing the rule for international students though, fun Shrek? So I've been watching this 4 hour long study vlog of a guy And he keeps looking bored Which makes me even more bored :bigmood: We gonna make it viv! :forg: :Bbay: Tbh I do feel like the frog experiment sometimes during finals week I'm lucky I have y'all to stay up with I remember reading an article about the happiest man in the world And Buddhism(although) was part of one of the questions asked from him. He said it was more like a personal philosophy that helped him. I'm very interested in neuroscience myself so it was fascinating to read about him. So I shared a video of little kids crying and still managing to perform something on children's day and my dad commented something like "spirit of working" which is really really impressive considering our generation gap now. God this has not been a good year No it was a different one Poor kiddos Sometimes I read this chat and question my life choices Yep Anyway I love how people laughed in the bg as if it would totally not happen in any Asian household No like, at the end of the video I thought i could hear people were laughing at the mom who threw the shoe and this throwing a shoe thing is something some(not all)Asian moms also do. I realize the video you shared is of a Hispanic mom though. Hope that clears it upüëç Yeah it's a funny story though Congratulations kyo!!

Thank you <3 we can resume those on the weekends after my exams And the lectures are working Yeah it was down For a while Everywhere But it's gonna be back To answer your question viv, they love to appropriate our culture,features etc and then dislike us for it Just look at all the tanning salons white people go to And then there's all the discrimination they do against us for being brown Oof, can you ice it Better yet, go to a hospital Yeah going to hospitals these days is risky Good luck! Yes Hey Oof I'm trying to get through a textbook but I only have its pdf on my android The book is so good I regret not finding it sooner Oh it's a textbook Like the kind I'm supposed to read for my final Textbook of Clinical Embryology by Vishram Singh would be its name Bruh Also why was everyone so mad at Sofia Girl couldn't catch a break Yeah it's going to be even worse in book 2 tbh Me looking at y'all thirsting after a guy:jebus: Noooo Viv gejhehshe I was typing out a whole list but you beat me to it Shawn Mendes

I remember watching House a lot in my pre med years(when I wasn't sure where I was going to end up) now that it's become a reality for me. I don't feel the need for it. I feel this on a personal level. Yeah At least UK has nhs I don't know what to say I mean you'd expect things to work better somewhere This is honestly the worst And yes This is why people would rather Not go to a doctor Seconded Yeah good for y'all We don't even have enough vaccines Really love vaccine patents Yeah we have Chinese vaccines too SinoVac, Sinopharm and Sputnik(that was Russian) But yeah really hits you that you're not as rich as the rest of the world Also vaccine patents :( Mhm me too fae Gotten so used to masks it's good I'm going to be working in a hospital Lu w the costume and the customary sunglasses and kalbasq *kalbasa Yepp I WOULD HAVE BURIED IT Anyway This is how I imagine Lu now Me too it was so fun The show So guys is it good to take your therapist's advice? Or do what your heart says because I have a decision to make I feel like I would be more at peace if I did what I wanted But my therapist disagrees Ok so I found something of my late grandfather's(may he rest in peace) an interview he'd given when I was really young and he was well enough to talk for hours. People who know me from other servers know I've been really affected by his death. My therapist says that I shouldn't listen to that interview until my exams are over so as to  not break my focus. But I think I should not have to wait and this isn't making my focus any better either. Like, thinking about all this Yeah I know nothing is going to bring the person I'd lost back So it's better to wait Thanks for hearing me out At least I have his voice Omg Was Kamilah bi? Oh yeah I remember her and gaius now Andy and Aisha are the 2 people I can think of off the top of my head Wrenn too It's so funny to me how Catholics and muslims have the same mindsets in schools I mean makeup was allowed but Internalized Guilt over it Was there Oh dear godüòÜ Oh :( The most I saw was the occasional girlfriend boyfriend scandal but then I was one of the kids always doing my own thing and we had a ||lot of bad things happening around us|| problem to deal with so I might have blocked all of it out to focus on my studies And I honestly just wanted to get out Still do I'm sorry to hear that O shit Emergency I'm hoping you were able to resuscitate Thank goodness I went to a Pakistani school in 2016 You can guess Yeah I remember that Hearing about that Oh :jebus: Okay but why don't they? I get it That's coercion. To put it mildly Uh Poor nurses ? Viv if you don't mind me asking why do you need to go to the psych ward? Okay don't worry about answering me Hugs We weren't ever allowed phones in school Also teachers are biased and dress code students a lot even in college :( Heaven forbid if you bring a cup of tea to class(this was pre covid) But I wouldn't have had a problem with all that if the same care was also taken with ensuring students are also learning things Also I usually needed something to wake me up during lectures because of my meds and unfortunately teachers weren't happy w that. Anyway. You have to pick your battles because many teachers make it an ego issue when you don't immediately do as they say Wow what the fuck ugh I'm so tired I just want my finals to be over your coworkers sound fun kyo Ayo I woke up so stressed and not sure if it's finals week stress or something else acting up I just feel dehydrated all the time Morning fae:caticon: HI LU Yepp Ngl Oooof üòî I'm so sorry Lu Take care of it Still sounds painful babe Take it easy for a while I have a  breakdown once a week Finals week make it 3 times a week Yeah I mean, I can offer a listening ear too although I promise I'm only this stressed out when I have exams What's the fun without dancing your heart out? I'll be getting bangs after my exams Just got to find a way to get rid of my own anxiety about results Sometimes I really hate the Hermione part of my identity Anything that helps you all in dealing with this? :nou: Yep. Plus it'll distract me It's pretty much the same with my Asian family(daughters always taught to sacrifice and accept whatever comes their way) and I've used my studies as a way to distract me a lot of family drama. Lately it's been me alternating between crying my eyes out over exam stress(that didn't used to happen when I was a premed and had higher stakes/plus it didn't even happen when I had my first professional exams)  and completely disassociating myself from the situation to the point I forget to take care of myself. Also I've been lashing out to people who have been kind to me in the past thinking they're going to leave me too so it's better if I do it first. So it's been rough and I'm really looking forward to seeing it all end with this exam so I can resolve this grief/anger I have inside of me. In short Emotions are not something I recommend feeling Yeah love makes the world go round and all Anyway the world can always use more empathy so I'm still glad I have my memories of the people I miss Mood Control your brother if possible No Pineapple on pizza is an abomination üòî Me as a cook Also I remember Joey liking it Existence is pain LOA better come back soon This is late to the party but since I'd read anything but what's on my test tomorrow if you actually have dimples it just makes you unique and isn't a cause for alarm health wise Oof Oh dear god At least you got practice This sounds like me with OH :this_is_fine: Awww But that's so wholesome Yeah that might have been it Also look at that face Please send more doggos it's been a horrible day 50/10 the goodest boy Look at the little rascal all sleeping peacefully ‚ù§Ô∏è Aww thank you üíï Guess who is falling asleep in a library *about to fall asleep,that is No I actually went for a walk in my hospital and woke up Guess who just found out a dopamine detox isn't a fully credible thing Thank God for the internet to keep us updated Uhh Okay let me explain Dopamine is a neurotransmitter People(A psychologist iirc) thought it "could" actually help them through smart phone addiction and other type of things that activate the reward system of the brain if they started to deny themselves the basic pleasures of listening to music,sex and basically anything that brought them joy. Some went so far in the fad that they started to avoid looking into people's eyes when talking. Until Harvard health had to publish a blog saying that this was going too far and a misrepresentation of an original idea. Practicing mindfulness and meditation etc are better ways if you want to cut down on a bad habit. Because you can't actually detox from a substance your body produces naturally https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/dopamine-fasting-misunderstanding-science-spawns-a-maladaptive-fad-2020022618917 Source also I'm a nerd But a prof mentioned it in a lecture and I just had to look it up Yikes Why do people have a problem with other people getting money Guys wish me luck for the next week Guys Italy won the Euro cup I'm so happy Ugh I just found out I'm allergic to something in a skincare mask i was trying I'm thinking it was a dye Or colouring. My mom's allergic to hair dye and when I was a kid I used to get a rash if I played with coloured play-doh Bright side, it took my mind off the vaccination I'm supposed to get tomorrow I already got it, this one is  for hepatitis B We get booster shots Lu you look amazing!!! I got a haircut too‚ô° Didn't get bangs though(chickened out) But yeah you look beautiful Hey how's everyone been doing Ahaha Guys I have a question Okay I'm going to ask it in  current events talk Guys what do you feed a calico? I have a stray coming to  my house and she seems to like milk so far Yeah this is why Ive been giving her soaked bread Not milk I asked someone I knew who owned cats and they said chicken should be fine As in boiled eggs? Thank you! Uhh Must have been frustrating to deal with ‚ù§Ô∏è Sending you some patience and peace. Hope you feel better soon viv Good night guys my whole batch wants to quit classes tomorrow to go swimming And they're asking all of us to not be in classes "in solidarity" üò¨ I'm gonna feel so horrible about itüòÇ They're probably also going to get an earful from the departments if they actually pull it off. It's an indoor pool But yeah it's still absurd. They should've set this up in the june heat waves OMG Not a good thing to see when I'm starving I googled it and üòã Guys what's the difference between manslaughter and murder Premeditation,right? Thankss I wish, I'm taking a forensic medicine exam next week and my Google search history looks like something out of a crime show writer's laptop. I wanted to be the cool forensic expert that arrived at every crime scene btw. And you're great at this That's great, I'm happy for you! Meee If you want to learn about firearm injuriesüòî It's no wonder I'm procrastinating this test By playing Choices But I have to actually study the firearms too I like trauma too I don't like weapons Yeah,there are a lot of those.. currently we are at recognizing Haha okay Yeah I'll be free from this test on Tuesday üëç I know a lot of useless facts about ||weapons and assassinations|| now Please dooo I should take a self defence course too tbh I thought it was cluck cluck cluck The best part of studying forensic is how inaccurate shows like Castle  or literally any show that showed  ||on screen shooting|| got it Sounds like a buzzfeed quiz Mood It's so stupid lmao Never found a good brand Aww Hereditary Scared the hell out of me Okay the last one had to be the fault in our stars I read the book thief but left it halfway through Also finished the 5 people you meet in heaven last week I'm taking my time with the book thief tbh(waiting for the right moment to finish it, it's too emotional and I already deal with enough emotion at the hospital) Lu's name causing me to have a stuffed crust pizza at this hour Also harry potter 4 makes me cry at every rewatch I can only remember the jingle and lots of fighting and frowning Homework is the stupidest thing to ever have been invented in the history of mankind I'm sorry I normally wouldn't complain so much it's just I really hate what I'm studying right now Me running away from the test hall Good luck fae,hopefully it isn't covid and just a false alarm I can add other ||depression|| symptoms but I'd rather not Bioethics is kicking my ass You'd think my light-reading would consist of Choices books but noüòî Disney needs to stop making movies that makes me cry though Where Where'd the CG come from On the server icon lol Huh I think I would've remembered seeing it Probably after the revamps I think you mean Acephobes. People really do be having a problem with what others are doing too much for my liking. Ew This is actually such a toxic way of looking at it. I'm glad people supported you. But what the fuck ^ Don't engage 10/10 would eat this bread I know it's a trap Morning guys Happy birthday drew it's the 24th for me:uwu: Mine is fairly common too Also good morning Something made me wake up at 5 AM this morning Weird AF behavior my mind does Anyway switching to online means avoiding morning traffic so I'm hoping(futilely)we never go back to offline classes Also a cutest thing about today, a classfellow's little brother stole his phone and for a while we had a demo of little kid laughing in a lecture of medicine It was so cute lol Same! Thank goodness for September I have so many questions about this emperor I like December but I always have exams then so Violet! Looks beautiful There's this Instagram account @ mikirai It reminds me a lot of Lu Mhm, I love how both of them spread so much positivity and are so badass, just like you Yeah exactly. Picture day at my college tomorrow and I'm here ironing clothes at midnight How's everyone doing We're supposed to dress formally too(blue themed) Ooh! It's class photo for college magazine Tempting Smurf idea I mean but they're big on tradition and professionalism in med school Mhm Astronomy sounds like such an interesting course. I'm studying immunology rn and wish we could trade for a while Me too, picture day is one of the best parts! I still have the ones we took in 1st year Or Freshman year as you people call it in US We look like babies compared to now It must be nice to keep those memories with you. Dr Smurf at your service I look cute in my class photo but y'all will just have to take my word for it since I realize my class fellows will not like their photos in a Choices Discord server It was a good way to have some fun before finals though Thanks!! I'm gonna need it. I hate group projects hey how's everyone doing Hi you all Could really use some support rn Can I talk here about it? So I just had a seizure After being free from them since 2019 Going to go to my neurologist and get it checked out but yes I feel horrible with the loss of control it brings me. Also it's a Sunday, so I can't get an appointment until Monday and it's freaking me out a lot. I hate literally everything about having a chronic condition Idk what's the worse thing about it, the self blame(even though) the rational part of my brain knows that literally any fucking thing can trigger an epileptic to have seizures, or seeing my mom's face. ||Anyway I've been on antidepressants and getting therapy(after I finally came to terms with me having depression) but yeah I wish I didn't have this epilepsy problem to bother my family with.|| Hi just wanted to update since I left a really worrying message here. I talked to a couple of friends face-to-face and I am doing a bit better than before(still scared to sleep in case it happens again). But yeah I guess I'm at the acceptance stage now. Yes I'm trying, thank you so much for listening. Have  been wearing glasses since 2nd grade I also got lasik last year and can say it definitely improved a lot of things for me since I had pretty bad astigmatism But yeah glasses are fun to wear and bonus: you look like a different person when you take them off I must say I agree w Lu tho, contacts are a pain to maintain and I never wore them much Hey it was pretty good I would recommend you get it done when you don't have much work to do And can take a couple weeks off from work My astigmatism meant there was a lot of difference between both my eyes(the right and the left one(3 and 8)) and the doctor told me I was essentially seeing more from my right eye This is why I went for lasik as soon as I turned 21 They just tell you to focus on the lights in the OT,the process is pretty painless and takes 30 minutes and I just held my breath and kept talking to them throughout my procedure Also I wasn't supposed to  open my eyes to look at sunlight, look at screens or read much so I just listened to music or read audiobooks and went for walks in the first 4 days after the lasik. And asked my mom to put drops regularly in my eyes after that. It's been a year now and I've never needed glasses Yeah my number used to increase with my height so it needs a couple of years for it to be stable enough to qualify for lasik Guys how do people manage to sleep 8 hours in exams I mean I legitimately need sleeping tips since the doctor has sort of added dosage of anti seizure meds to the ones I was already taking So yeah I went for a walk, tired myself out and now I need to sleep 8 hours for the meds to work Yeah can't help it The doctor says I need to put my health first though, and I agree And my therapist says that she'll help me schedule things I agree thank you for talking me through it Don't even worry about it I'll try sleeping now and waking up early To study As long as I give myself a month to adjust to new meds I should be fine health wise Good luck fae Happy Thanksgiving guys Mood I didn't even know people ate turkeys Thank you! I had one of my fav things for dinner Also tiktok got unbanned where I lived so I've been living for the cat videos I know it's old news by now but a Pakistani artist just got nominated for Grammy's üíï I'm stupidly thankful for that Mina's obvs Taylor Swift with a little lo-fi mixed in Drew speaking facts Mine just banned music and long nails and wearing your hair down But yeah lol all of us still turned out to be degenerates Also yeah no matter how much of a religious upcoming you give to your kids, one day they *will* be curious about the rest of the world Nah it is impossible These days everyone has internet Plus I remember asking my 4th grade teacher what 'sexy' meant so yeah I'm pretty sure I terrified her We also had no sex ed, no prom, just something called color day every month when everyone would have a potluck and get a day off from lessons and enjoy I went to an all girls Christian college in high school. We went to watch the Christmas play too. and a couple of concerts. In med school you really can't escape mixed gatherings so yeah you're supposed to look at these people as your future colleagues People still date and make friends though I was pretty attacked by my Muslim extended family because I went to a Christian college(my immediate family was supportive) But yeah I always think it made me more open minded Ours never does either, it's a taboo This is me oversharing again but probably why I sometimes feel so behind on everything that you guys living in the west have already done, I mean yeah a religious upbringing is probably one of the worst things you can do to a kid And I can't help but resent my family for that although they didn't know better Aww thanks This definitely makes me feel a little better Oh I wish I could see snow Nice to meet you Ahmed I can't help but ask, are you South Asian by any chance? Oh that's nice If I never saw a pixorize video again I'd be happy in my life Well they're video mnemonics that help you remember drugs And how they work and what they do to the body But now I'm getting sick of the videos too. Yeah I wouldn't be studying this hard if I hadn't wanted to move to another country for my specialization and had annual exams in 2 months Also graduation is in 2 years so This is why I vanished from the server Guess what I'm saying is, don't be a med student lol your life will never be the same No, they take Indian and Pakistani graduates directly into residency if you clear the steps in the US And the UK has also softened its policy, only IELTS and PLAB 1(which is going to be changed to UKMLA in 2024) is needed And they don't induct you into residency, they basically train you as junior doctors which is still better than the house job program we do in India/Pakistan as part of 5 years of MBBS Yeah lol this is why most people want to go, better pay Also better training Exactly I mean Hate to speak  terribly of my own country But jesus christ Even my senior doctors aren't getting into residency programs and corruption+sifarish culture is rampant At least wherever I go, I want to end up there on my own merit And it's not like our healthcare system doesn't need doctors, we just have a private mafia who doesn't want doctors to serve at the government hospitals here. So yeah our teachers encourage us to do our training from any country that accepts people like us Yeah I'd like to make enough to support me and my parents. I don't want to be super rich. But still So much inflation and so little relief Pretty tired of unemployment too, job market along with working hours is very depressing here. Anyway thanks for letting me talk here I needed a breather from studies and I feel more focused now I've been in this online server for a while(don't ask me what came over me) but yeah oh my goodness I'm talking about a different one,people(men) from ages 18 to 28 are hitting on me But yeah I'm in my desperation+boredom era Okay, so SHUT UP THE DM's ARE A GOLD MINE Honestly I'm worried about the future of humanity if this is the direction straight people are taking it Yep Aw I forgot to blur him out Yep Look at this He studied architecture and sounded completely normal until I told him I thought I might be ace Okay if you found this infuriating you should read this one lol I barely controlled my own anger You'd only understand this if you can read Urdu/Hindi But yeah he opened with a picture. And his audacity ...now you see why I want to leave my country very badly Also the reason I'm not straight Lol Yeah honestly it ruined my mood Yeah it's not your fault. I was honestly looking for some fun online, someone to chat with about my day and if living in the 6th worst country for women in offline spaces isn't enough, I have to be reminded of that in online spaces too? Also the reason why I may sound so severe when it comes to male LI's is this. Anyway I can laugh about it now lol Well my brother was a foreign exchange student and he loved being there His host family was really incredible My mom taught him to cook before he left though. And his host dad(knowing he'd never seen the snow before) once woke him up early to see snowfall in the US So yeah I was a kid who can barely remember that time now, and missed my brother like hell but he did well in American high school and the family was pretty accepting from what I can recall. I remember he once got the flu on a camping trip and they took care of him and didn't worry us. And they permitted him to visit NYC too. That too! I remember him saying they offered him to try alcohol once 10 months But yeah he also did community service, went on Obama's campaign,went on homecoming, and did everything normal highschoolers do Basically it was slight culture shock(for him). But if you're gracious hosts like his family was, you get through these parts. I couldn't apply to that program because of their sibling policy lolüôÑ My best friend and my brother's fiancee also went on the same program ,it's pretty popular in Pakistan Only one child from one household So yeah since my brother already applied for it and we share a last name, it was impossible for me to apply Yeah my best friend went to Texas(her host family was there) Basically the program is to make use of cultural exchange scholarships and make sure maximum households benefit from it. Plus I've already crossed the age limit( I'm 22) so yeah no point dwelling on it now Oof Oof Smart lu Yeah those are pretty much a piece of cake for me too And yeah I plan to specialize from outside Pakistan anyway so I think I didn't miss much if I didn't get the US high school experience Although it would've been nice Well my parents have always let us try anything we set our mind to Also he's the middle child Not the eldest one So he gets away with everything And he's marrying the girl he befriended during the exchange trip So yeah I'm happy for him Hey you only get one life Well tbh my parents are different than the typical asian ones. And my brother didn't do the thing my best friend did after the exchange trip He came back, finished his studies, went to business school and now has a job and a house of his own My best friend floundered although it wasn't her fault. So yeah I do wonder if not going benefited me. I would've lost focus from med school And yes, like Amethyst said, right time and place for everything It's okay, you know You still are a pretty successful person from where I'm standing So which country do you want to go to? I don't know yet, honestly my dream specialty would be anywhere from neurology to psychiatry to histopathology(my uncle is one) but my ENT rounds went really well this year so might consider paying it more attention next year. One thing I will never choose is peads because I can't stand working with sick children. Istg I mean Everyone from my eldest brother to my mom is pushing me for peads Because I've been taking care of kids since I was 12 Yeah same I have a gift with them Kids respond to me Even stranger ones Always smile back. But yeah I'm afraid of burning out with those fields Well I mean, I wish I had something like that The most I have is a discord server full of epileptics I definitely have to keep in mind my own levels of comfort. Since I knew only 1 pediatric neurologist in my own province, it was a challenge for my parents when I was first diagnosed and put on my meds So yeah I get what you mean. I was also 12 lol I'm a third year medical student Yeah honestly it's fun I love the pixelbartie emote That's super sweet of you Also, if it's possible for you to contact them beforehand, ask them what they like and dislike. My brother's host family did that. And it meant a lot to us. We also sent gifts from Pakistan for them. I don't know that either,maybe you should ask whoever you're hosting or just get those to be safe Mom come pick me up my parents are arguing over the guest list again Guys if I ever get married remind me to elope I'm also supposed to go visit wedding venues today I love happy endings but jesus wedding planning stresses me out lol I swear Yeah our weddings are more of a food buffet than anything But yeah I get what you mean Those are the kind of people I wish I'd meet I had a lot of fun at my eldest brother's wedding though, we prepared mehndi dances and everything. This time it's covid era and everyone of my cousins is already married or engaged so I doubt it's going to be that much of a fun thing. Plus I'm not a teen anymore I'd probably receive more marriage proposal lmfao Goals Yikes Same Yeah thankfully I and my parents aren't interested They want me to be educated first. I have to keep my grades up though Yeah I've told them I want to specialize abroad and that's not possible if I have a husband to think of too. So I'm not going anywhere at least until my undergraduate. Still, I'm lucky they're understanding and don't bend to social pressure regarding marriage See! Yeah exactly We have to be independent first from their point of view Yeah I got my first proposal at my eldest brother's wedding I was 17 lol But yes a couple of my classmates are married and have kids, I have to attend a friend's engagement next March. Tbf I was wearing makeup,heels and a gown But yeah my dad didn't even tell me and forcefully declined I got it out of my mom later when they all acted weird. Yeah honestly I haven't even had my first kiss yet and seeing my classmates married and with adulthood responsibilities it's hard to feel I'm missing out on much Exactly Exactly idk maybe growing up as a Muslim or as a nerd did it to me lol But I genuinely don't feel romantic towards people Yeah exactly, don't feel like I'm missing much. THIS All the guys are not my type I mean, I went on a friend date with someone, it was awkward. I know what you mean This is one of the reasons I can't take men seriously Enough to date, that is. I can be professional, sure. But they're just so mediocre(not you Drew) Apart from a couple guys in my med school that really know their stuff study wise, most of them aren't really used to cleaning up after themselves. Yeah I've been trying to train my brother not to ask me for everything if mom isn't here(it's going well tbh he really wants to impress his future wife) But it's obvious how mom babied him throughout our childhood Haha I knew how to make tea, breakfast, help mom with chores literally everything while doing well in school and my parents were like, at least their sons had jobs and weren't on drugs Which is a social problem I know, but yeah I'd have loved some more appreciation It's because they're written by women Oh haha don't even get me started on what happens if I introduce my mom to a male friend I'm not even dating So yeah I guess I'm eloping for my future wedding Oof, it's always one parent Well I hope our society comes out of this mentality some day Yeah lol I wish my parents would see me being awkward towards my gender as something to be investigated further I mean, god is it difficult for me to hide my sexuality now That definitely tracks HAHA I mean I have to force myself to fake interest in men Women though After I sent it Be my mom.
Send your daughter to all girls college in high school.
Never think about why your daughter says I love you to her friends a lot.
Never even think about why your daughter has only two female friends.
Never think about why your daughter has had only crush on a man in her life.
Never think about why your daughter has such a problem with marriage in general.
Surprisedpikachuface. Also, add me being out to my best friend in a long while and my mom still not knowing Ugh anyway The less I pay attention to this aspect of my life the better Aw Have you tried getting some help for that You know there's therapy that helps I mean, I genuinely don't know where I would be without my therapist That's definitely a good idea, but a therapist can tell you what to do to help you adapt to the environment until you can escape That too, you can look for speech therapists, I'm sure India has those. I looked into ||grief counseling, depression and family therapy and interpersonal skills after my anxiety got so bad I started having panic attacks and suicidal ideation || in college. Not only did my therapist help with that, she also happens to make me study schedules. Do you have someone who you can approach at school maybe a teacher? Please don't hesitate to reach out to them. Covid has been a horrible time for everyone, so just tell your parents you want to talk to someone who is not them I open up about these things just so I can help other people :) You shouldn't feel bad for not getting covid I didn't get it either Strong immune system (I hope) But the point is, talking to someone you can(a school counsellor, a therapist, without guilt of overburdening them)  helps deal with negative feelings Aw I'm sorry for that Oof I hope you're doing better now If you're young you'll hopefully regain it. DW about grades. Oooh good luck But still then you definitely need a counselor Girl freaking out isn't going to work What subject is first? If you've studied well you don't need to worry I got 1058 in class 10th lol But I didn't have covid to deal with Oof,same But yeah most of what we learn in 9th,10th is useless unless you choose medical and engineering Omg I have been taking exams since 8th class You should see the ones we get in med school Ooh then you need high grades even in these subjects You don't have time to decide unfortunately This is what I particularly hate about our education system, I knew from class 3 that I wanted to be a doctor. I had to study so many subjects to get there Tfw I hate maths I mean, apart from algebra I remember nothing else made sense to me Okay go study kid You have your boards High grades get you far in any field by the way Yep! All the best! Don't stress and take some chocolate in the exam hall in case you run low on energy I played Chapters and Romance Club for a while Didn't like both much Just had a family gathering I wanna sleep for a week now lol Still got to go to a food tasting thing Oh mine doesn't do that I'm too old to be bossed around But yeah I force myself to be polite at several instances. And I *have* missed seeing my family. Eh being 17 isn't the same as being in your early 20's. I usually act very extroverted and keep up a shallow conversation to cover up my social anxiety so yeah. Also being in medicine teaches you to talk to people from different ages I guess. Aw It's sweet of her Mine too, she often can tell if I'm really anxious Haha no I'm a very fast talker And I'm quick to laugh @ myself Like, I was showing my mom a picture of my senior who recently got married, and said: now my mom wishes she had a daughter like that. Which uh sort of points to my own insecurities towards myself. But I'm hoping my family thought of it as one of my usual self-deprecating jokes. That used to happen with me too. Damn I realized I had an assignment to make Bye! Lol It's about behavioral science, our country's equivalent to psychiatry/ethics Nah I usually enjoy these assignments, only ethics/behavioral  sciences assignments make me think and actually apply what I'm studying This is why I put neuro/psych as something I might be looking for studying further I did itü•≥ It had only 2 questions 1 about sleep hygiene and another about the health belief model I probably took longer than most of my classmates Adele's album is so good @Arzaylea  I had a question My doctor prescribed me vitamin D3 but he told me to take it with milk, is it the right way to take it? Thank you! I sometimes forget these things pretty easily Yeah of course We review things all the time Currently going on to visit a bridal venue with my family please someone put me out of my misery Just a long uncomfortable car ride with no music Yeah it's the family discussion I'm not fond of I'm playing music though Reached the venue Looks lovely Well we wanted the venue to be closer to our house For convenience ü•∂ I can't imagine how cold it must be Meanwhile I'm living in one of the most polluted regions of the world So yeah can't wait for summer again Okay I bet you looked cute Yikes The most the temperature falls here is 17 degrees Celsius Which would be 62 degrees Fahrenheit You don't want to live in the pollution Trust me But yeah apart from that it's pretty warm I mean I'm wearing jeans and a light sweater Isn't it funny how you remember the birthdays of the people you went to school with? I mean, I haven't talked to a lot of them in ages But I suddenly remembered my best friend from class 10th's birthday Woke up with a sore throat I hate my life I remember watching demon slayer That was a little too early for me to read at 9 AM on a Monday morning Kyo I'll join you I've some reading to do Yeah I'll just stream my book dw about it And watch yours when I need a break Yeah I've heard of it lol I guess it was school kids saying it originally We just took it as a joke At least the people who I hang out with on Twitter did. Nobody above the age of 16 really takes the rivalry with india seriously And every kid here wants to be a pilot I hope I'm not the only college kid that feels like they were smarter in high school My slightly political take on it would be that both our countries need to revamp our educational system and our politicians need to stop taking advantage of us but I've been thinking that since my own Matric/FSC so yeah it's not a surprise GUYS MY FRIEND JUST MADE AN EDIT OF US OMG I LOVE IT üò≠ They're both graduating earlier than me so it was something I really needed Yeah I'm gonna watch that video every time I feel down now Oh how accurate did they get It was hilarious enough when they served *pani puri* as a meal in Choices Castes The word you're looking for is castes Oh I don't know much about Hindu goddesses Exactly what I was thinking I'd be happy about something like this but it's impossible to get something like this right unless you study the religious texts Absolutely valid Oh okay Exactly, I remember a friend telling me just how extensive the books she had to study were I highly doubt a game app did this much research Exactly Okay this is disrespectful Muslim religious texts are like these too. There are literal volumes of Quran and Hadith Wow this is so shocking They should never have done this And putting a disclaimer does nothing tbh I'm glad I don't play Romance Club I watched it It had really bad depiction of Muslims too, I just watched it for Deepika's acting Mhm Yeah Plenty of Hindus in Pakistan too I hope people in the RC fandom talk about it Yeah I mean Khilji was real But most of these annexations happened because the rulers wanted more land to rule, not women. Also, the thing I found the most problematic was them somehow romanticizing "Suttee" In fiction, we all know what happens at the end, it's shown as a sacrifice I mean It was a good movie to watch though, if you don't overthink Guys is there a text to speech function in Adobe reader? I'm honestly a boomer when it comes to tech stuff Thankss! Good Luck Sleep early today please Drink green tea to calm your nerves Something called SST Uh why? We had board exams in Matric and FSC 3 hour long, both written and MCQ's Yes I know This is what happens here too Lol I got 1058/1100 In 10th Proper nerd But yeah kids got covid to deal with I like this better They took exams only of electives this year of 10th grade. Here, because of covid. But yes I guess the entrance exams are the real game. Thank goodness I am past that age. Do you guys have the equivalence system for O/A level students too? Ours used to put Cambridge students at a disadvantage before they finally revised the policy If you got an A*, it used to count for 90 percent and lower the merit for those students, unlike the students who had done Matric/FSC from Pakistani boards and got 96 pc, 92 pc Yeah my friends who'd done A/O levels were always complaining about that Oh okay Hey hey Deep breaths Look this is happening with everyone,right? Not just you. So yeah. You'll be fine Families really suck in this regard Tell them to stop bothering you Yup you will be Yeah you're going to be just fine, now do something you normally enjoy doing and then go to bed at a reasonable time so you're well rested. Oh yeah I get that I was the topper in my family But eventually I told them to stop making me anxious You said your mom was the one who understands, so maybe get a pep talk from her, okay? Also your batch is going to be more prepared for universities because believe me that life is all about self study All the best! So happy to hear that Moms always make things better !! I didn't want to say it because I knew it was a big deal for you but yes They don't matter at all sweetie I was good at cramming and sciences so I got good marks And got a laptop out of it And got admission in the college I wanted But yes, apart from that, I know people who have scored really low and they have excelled in university Hi! What do they teach you in maths now? We had pretty tough algebra and geometry and statistics I remember asking my mom to help me with statistics portion because she has a masters in that Gn! Have sweet dreams Also quadratic formula oof Math was pretty horrible lol Yeah sounds about right I would rather study anatomy again than study maths They teach you real anatomy in medical school, I still have nightmares üò¢ Ahaha this happened with my MCAT I took it thrice Once when it got leaked, once when it was retaken and I couldn't make the cut off, and once a year later when I was already enrolled in my preferred course but wanted to study it closer to home Lol anyway This is why I tell you guys Entrance tests are the real game Yeah this is why I am ungovernable The meme It was so unfair to all of us who had nothing to do with the paper getting leaked but ended up wasting a year anyway Yeah same Maybe to prepare the kids Well I'm listening to piano music Weirdly enough, it helps me study Let me listen to it and tell you what I think of it Spotify has Hindi lyrics? Okay I love the beat and thank goodness I can understand it I think I loved his song Tareefan Yeah his songs were a little objectifying lol But then again, so are most Punjabi rap songs But this one is pretty good I'll never admit it to people who know me irl but I kinda miss my glasses sometimes Esp in winter Thinking of getting frames to protect my eyes from the smog Haha dreaming about upcoming exams I hate it here I hope your exam went well Yay! Oof, same Take some rest Aw, I'm so glad you did well I hope mine go well too Some of you didn't learn geography and it shows Literally all of the tech CEO's are Indian So proud,and it makes me proud to be brown Yeah ofc Going to stream my RC playthrough in VC Guys I ate burnt popcorn I have no shame I wish I went to film school and was rich I wish winx club was real Rainbow bridge? Oh Guys is writing letters to your loved ones considered a healthy coping mechanism? I do that to make myself feel better when I'm missing them, but my therapist compared it to an addiction Yeah thank you! This makes more sense. Wish I could dye my hair like that My hair chalk was this color but it didn't show up my hair is too blacküòÖ How does it look kyo! I wanna see, it's my fav color Guys how do you motivate yourself to exercise in cold weather I'm seriously struggling and trying not to gain weight this winter+reduce stress this exam season Okay never mind I did it and it feels so good without the humidity Come to Pakistan the weather is pretty sunny today Maybe she's just changed during the pandemic A couple of my friends did that, I confronted them about it and they realized they hadn't been treating me nicely during my initial year in med school, but the pandemic made them realize how much behavior matters Also yeah this happens when people get to an older age especially in family Your feelings are really valid but if I were you I'd not talk to her tbh About the change, I mean Friends are a different game, relatives are another. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I can guess which religion too But yeah I'm sorry she was pushy Nobody should be forced into a religion they don't want to be a part of Exactly! That's what I do with a lot of people too. Sounds like the best strategy You can also politely leave the room I use my studies as an excuse often Yay! Can't wait to see Also apparently brunettes need to bleach their hair before dyeing it purple so :( I'll do that after my annuals it'll be my little gift to myself Yeah of c My mom's allergic to hair dye But I've never had a reaction from mehndi So idk Exactly! You gotta bleach first Nope Haha I'll probably go to a saloon for my first time My spotify wrapped is here let's see how much Taylor Swift is here This is so funny GUYS ü§£ It's okay you should look at my top 5 Love how Taylor dominates everything I had a nostalgic moment with Linkin Park I was in the top 2 percent of the people who streamed Taylor Swift on spotify LOL Same It was one of my Twitter usernames for a while lol Also I love Billie Eilish And Shawn Mendes Pretty much all of the ones on my list are those artists that I love Bon Iver ended up just because of Exile This is so cute I remember telling viv my name was willow before I was comfortable enough on this server She's so pretty! Imagine what you'd have done with those days had you actually spent them on another hobby Like mine makes up to 4 days I could've had a holiday I've been playing Romance Club And playing Choices after that, it's so obvious where Choices went wrong The forced LI bit which most of us complain about is not there I'm not saying RC is perfect ofc But once you reject a LI, they don't hit on you any longer, the LI's show actual jealousy if you romance more than one of them And your Choices actually matter, if you don't make smart ones, you get horrible endings lol Pretty sad. Alwaysü´Ç lol Hey Rashon! Missed you:forgheart: You ever start a study session and you're already tired or is it just me? At this point only the thought of looking like this in the next couple of months is keeping me going Found my hair color HAHA I'm going to give everyone at my brother's wedding and my cousin's wedding such a shock And, best part, No marriage proposals Yep Because aunties do not like Women who look outspoken and dangerous Nothing tells me I need to study than my forest app yelling at me to put down my phone Guys how do you know when it's time to cut a friendship out of your life(I'm talking about an irl one) Also if anyone from the LGBTQIA would uh, like to listen to me for a while I talk about my feelings they're really welcome to do that. Thanks‚ù§Ô∏è What if they're ||homophobic|| and you're not comfortable with that anymore? Initially you didn't know their feelings ran this deep. I mean I'm so sad rn. It's easy for you all, you are taught most of this stuff in childhood, but if you have a religious upbringing,you don't understand ||your sexuality and you think your friends would be okay with your identity, but one of them isn't. How many of you would cut out friendships|| for that? Yeah now I don't think I can be myself with them Because I have been in the closet for so long I got used to pretending to like guys with them Thank you Lu, as always you give good advice. I already know that :( This is one of the reasons me and my friend had a falling out It's pretty homophobic what she said so I wouldn't repeat it. This is the final plan Leave+cut contact obvs I try not to think about it too much Since I study medicine I'm hoping it's not difficult for me to go somewhere where I can live the way I want to Can you loop songs on spotify mobile? Where exactly is the loop? I don't see it? No Artist's playlist Oh okay! Thanks! Happy birthday Rashon! It all goes up from here! I was making a birthday video for my friend And realized we act so silly around each other lol All of my fav people were born today I don't want to hear that It's too early in the morningüò¢ Just got back from my cousin's wedding I have to say her cat was the friendliest I've ever seen her Finals week gang Panik I'm more worried why I'm not panicking lol Yeah sem In the grand scheme of things, It doesn't matter Aw It's really good to have a sensitive brother Mine was like that growing up and it eased a lot of things for me. Thanks viv! Oof Happens w all siblings tho I'm the youngest and it never stops lol But yeah they usually have your back in the way friends don't do Well we have had our share of fights I mean We used to wrestle Like those WWE Fighters Ahahaha I'm sorry This is probably why I find most guys mediocre I feel, I compare them with my brothers a lot Also the reason I'm bi My brother used to break my toys lol Literally all of them I mean, we used to fight a lot. But tbf he had to put up with a little sister and I stole all his cool points In school Cool points as in he used to take me to school every morning üôà @azula She's listening to spotify It's such a loud song lmfao I doubt she can hear the ping Guys all too well(10 min version) is doing things to me Making me cry, that is Also, hoodie season finally arrived thank goodness Me too Both Aw Guys should I get my Pfizer booster just before Christmas or this week? I mean I do have finals till 22 so I don't want to mess them up With the side effects I got sinopharm as the first shot But my SIL was a nursing mom and she said she got fever etc Sinopharm did give me muscle pain plus a headache Yeah every day is important if you've got med school finals unfortunately and I can't study if I have a headache Eh I'll just wait till my 2nd last final And we're not having ward rounds during exams so we should be safe Thanks! I'll get the booster soon,then. :jebus: Ohh Maybe muffins Or cupcakes? I always took those for fundraisers Those sound amazing I had cake for lunch omg Hi I have my exam tomorrow Anxiety getting to me now lol Yep Kinda feel like even the SSRI'S aren't doing much But yeah I guess this is just a part and parcel of med school Viv's got the best stories That's nothing One time I lost my debit card inside my practical copy and created a whole panic,called my bank before discovering it *inside* the copy(I was using it as a bookmark) My family still doesn't trust me w my money lmfao Kyo I doubt you'd have to study pharmacology too Only doctors and nurses study that That being said, I'm finally fucking done with my pharmacology sendup Wow an amazing opportunity Also a lot of responsibility! I'm sure they thought you were up for it Not me remembering all the details of answers to the viva questions *after* my viva has ended :IDKher: Didn't you have to take the NCLEX, Lu? The best kind of mentors do that actually Guys my biochem prof is so cute she complimented my haircut today I'm going to feel good about it for a week I'm not in her class anymore ofc Also after I passed 2nd year one of my histology professors told me I was her favorite student :ferretoblush: Ikr, I was going to give one of my last vivas of the year and she raised my spirits Do any of you have family members that refuse to go to the doctor or listen to their advice at all? It's getting really frustrating for me tbh Yeah ik I kinda want to drag my dad to the hospital after his BP came out a little high despite the meds And my mom to take her being pre diabetic seriously Ik me imagining the worst case scenario *doesn't* help but after losing ||both my grandad and my best friend last year and my mom getting severe covid|| they're all I've left Thanks Adam! I'll get my booster on Monday ‚ù§Ô∏è Good luck! Hopefully it's not that extensive! https://youtu.be/kZ9x25yTwdU I love these videos so much My dad's one of them. He's really dark skinned, and the first time 12 y old me for a blood test he scared me to hell and back telling me all about how the nurses could never find his veins Morning I slept for 12 hours I do that too ugh Lipitor Oh you already did that Lipitor actually causes muscle cramps since our muscles use glycogen normally HAHA Yep Oof Yeah if you don't want the baby to be like my cousin whose mom had to cook while carrying the  2 year old in her lap My mom said she didn't pick us up if we were happily playing in our beds. And my grandma had problems with that. But it helps develop independence in kids Hahahaha Cries in 5'3 I have Asian genes Also my mom's so short It's a miracle I managed to be taller than her I'm 160 cm lol Also there was something called the Bengal famine that apparently caused nutritional deficiencies in our generation Anyway Oh Mhm I remember reading about that a little when I went to interview someone whose dad had run away There was a famous poet Called Faiz Ahmed Faiz I went to interview his daughter He was jailed in Pakistan ofc under military rule Uh, revolutionary Yes Yes But he strongly favored Russia when our military was in favor of the US And he was in jail for it Yeah ofc If you're multilingual like me and have an interest in literature you read a lot of interesting things Trying is what matters initially I'm always trying to improve my English too Even though I've had an English medium education since first grade and excelled at it, Urdu is the language I'm most comfortable with. Having spoken it since since birth My Punjabi is pretty good because of my parents and most of the people I interact with in the hospital are from a Punjabi background so I am improving it for their sake. I don't have to think before speaking Urdu, it's what I've been speaking since I learned to talk I wouldn't have known that if you hadn't told me But yeah I want to learn more languages some day. Yes As for the accent thing, I used to feel really bad about having an accent with English(Indian accent) as per Google but now I realize that means I learned a whole language by reading it and learning it myself and that's something to be proud of. Also, the people who've been the most help for me in med school(apart from my own professors)have been Indians on YouTube clearing so many concepts for free. Yep I've always found them so helpful Same Kyo can you call a friend during your final or? True My handwriting gets more illegible every year of med school lol Thank goodness a lot of doctors now use electronic prescriptions I just did half an hour of yoga I wanna die And I still have so much stuff to do. My dumbass put 3 reps instead of 2 reps so I still have 14 minutes to go Okay on the bright side I know I can do this one for a long time People who watch youtube videos, do you guys prefer ambient music in the background or not?? Oh, I mean if someone plays music in the background of their video Would you be more inclined to watch it?? Thanks! That was really helpful Thank you for sharing that Looks a lot like the Burj Khalifa That's me on it I only like it because of its affiliation w Mecca and Medina #irl-squad Ohh I hope you grow to be comfortable with where you are now You'll have opportunity for moving to others I'm sure of it Morning guys Morning guys I got done w my pathology final Feels like I want to sleep for a week haha Good luck kyo Normal If you can make it humorous it's better The ones you get in your DM's and send to your GC to laugh at the creativity Animals dressed up in Christmas hats is my favorite thing these days Uh Na I take a different one I can check my pharma book for you but you should ask your healthcare provider fae Since I'm not qualified to give medical advice unless I graduate Can someone help me choose from these study tables? I was looking towards the wall mounted ones but my mom wanted one that was easily moveable so I deferred to her. I'm as indecisive as a baby when it comes to these things tho Yeah I'm going to get a comfortable chair lol I'm 5'2 ü§£ It definitely looks good And I need more drawer space because of all the books I have Yay! Really foggy out today I'm worried for my final exams(how will I be able to reach the center) Cute pfp viv Test Marigolds in a flowerpot Mhm My friend sent this picture to me And I thought it would make a lovely pfp You just made me Google that and I love it What's the prompt? I'm more partial to this one, it's called Nightqueen( *Raat ki Rani*) in Urdu and it may not look like much but it gives off such a sweet smell at night Also Jasmine, one of the ways we'd entertain our grandfather when he was bedridden was bring him fresh flowers every day. It gives off a sweet smell too, and always makes me think of him now Yay! *pretend it's me singing the ciao adios I'm done song* As long as you look on the sunny side I had biryani and cake now I don't want to move:IDKher: *biryani And yeah it's my favorite dish. Yeah our cuisine is quite famous there But I disagree, homemade biryani is where it's at! It's one of the few things I'll learn to cook before moving out Oof what happened OMG your pfp I'm trying to apply for my annual exams After sitting in my mocks Uhh How do you disable GIF's in discord I just had a slight headache/seizure because of the GIF in QOTD, would appreciate you all not sending GIF's GIF's with flashing lights Thanks though, I'll do that Hate having photosensitivity I applied finally Also done w 3/4 exams The last one is ethics I can lift my niece and I feel tired 15 minutes later. I lifted a toddler weighing 8 kg the other day and felt exhausted My brain feels like mush haha Fuck I didn't even notice until you pointed it out Also my teeth hurt omg Good morning everyone Yes I did! I have wisdom tooth pain today The only thing that's helping is warmth And can't believe people still call it the wisdom tooth when there's nothing wise about having pain even when trying to talk What typhoon? Oh I'm really sorry to hear that I hope you guys are safe I'd kill for warm and sunny rn It's 50 F out and I'm freezing Yeah kinda hard for me to live in a city where it's extremes of both sides of temperature lmao Normally I'd enjoy the winter it's just that I have my annual exams at the end of January And I can't study wrapped up in blankets üòÇ Guys I forgot to look at my datesheet and I have my ethics exam on Tuesday instead of Wednesday üíÄ I was studying pharma before that and thank goodness I looked at the datesheet again instead of showing up a day later This closely resembles one of my stress dreams Mhm You stressing about it would probably lead to more hairfall If you want to moisturize your hair, try some coconut oil. That's what I do.  Check for any allergies before that though Also my dermatologist would probably ask you to check your iron levels She always does that whenever students complain about their hairfall I think so Also you're not supposed to wash your hair everyday. Use a shower cap. Can you guys DIY it? I'd really not like to spend a bunch of money Same omg I used to be really curly-haired as a kid and now the hair closer to my scalp is still curly while the rest of it is manageable Idk what happened Thanks! They just say it to sell it You remind so much of my brother it's hilarious, he used to use a 4-1 product OMG I HATE IT I MEAN I just looked at his stuff when he was last over I'd let you do that but he has a kid who I'm v fond of so ü§£ Straight menüíÄ !! Ever since I finally got one my life has changed I don't brush my hair anymore Also I keep it short No ew I've heard onion water is beneficial but I'd rather have my hair smell of coconuts than this Same goes for egg and mayo as a conditioner that some people swear by It takes you forever to get the stinky smell of omelette out of your hair and the over shampooing after that ends up causing more harm Guess whose mom did that in her childhood üò¢ I think I have another thing to bring up in therapy Anyway I refuse to go within 10 feet of *anyone* that uses eggs or onion in their hair And I resisted that when I got older ofc Idk maybe it's a desi mom thing Guys ethics is so boring omg I mean, the way it's taught here ig I think it's because more of this stuff comes with practice rather than textbooks Hmm, partially right I mean, it's about how human psyche works But parts of it are things I'm uncomfortable with??
The psychological studies like the Trolley dilemma I know I'm not really built for the humanities. I see the benefits, they're ever changing but that's something which is a hypothetical situation. Pretty useful to study though, hospital settings are stressful Yeah it happens On another note, I'm having carrot halwa right nowüòã Aloe vera is used for skincare too It turns out my rambling had basis in another paper wow Hey my ethics exam went really well Good luck lu I feel like you submitted something counts for a lot Guys do kids genuinely cry during Santa photos I mean? My niece is crying on sitting on Santa's lap?? Aren't they supposed to be happy? I think she was just overwhelmed Same 1 year old me is eating her  gift wrappers on her birthday party And there are some swimming pool pictures of 5 y old me I would never want out Going to get my booster today üíÄ I probably got the concept of santa at that age I watched my first Christmas play in college Aw Ohh You should try the OPTP garlic mayo fries I think those are one of the best Got pfizer guys Didn't feel a thing I think I felt more side effects with sinopharm, but I'll keep that in mind Fuck it's gonna stay forever in my country Omg I hope you're okay, seeing this is pretty traumatizing How do you even admit patients like these? I have an uncle in my extended family who got covid, never got tested, and got an MI because of it. People don't realize how bad it gets Same but it was a grandfather and a best friend. It also gave my mom+brother covid, and me severe anxiety Yeah I'm glad you did I hope they recover soon Honestly at this point my own sympathy level is maxed out Like, I feel horrible of course but the only members of my class who didn't get covid in the past year were slacking on their vaccine Yeah,I've heard every variant of the anti-vax rumor there is, and it makes me surprised how much misinformation there is Omg Merry Christmas everyone! Hope you all have a lovely holiday Mhm You could always see their social media and check what they like Drew Thank goodness we always get money too I mean only my friends know what I like so I'd rather not get more watches,or handbags Nah,I wanted to when I was a kid because I was smarter than all my classmates. But yeah med school is the first time I've really had to work hard I get bored by everything pretty easily tho How did you guys figure you have ADHD? Me too ugh Thank you! Here's to avoiding covid and its variants in 2022 Get well soon lu, glad to know you tested negative üò© This is exactly the circumstances I despise Hope you had your booster before today Good luck hon, hopefully it's gonna affect you. I once ended up at a family gathering where I was the only person who ate outside but I still took selfies w my cousins(who tested positive a few days later and had symptoms they didn't think were covid) and I avoided it Happy new year's eve! 10 minutes for me And the fireworks are hereüò´ Happy new year from Pakistan! Such a goodest girl‚ù§Ô∏è Aww, Best boy‚ù§Ô∏è Looks so badass Hey üßü God I can't wait for WtD Damn Hope the police catch him Why people gotta do stupid shit Jesus christ That's a lot Don't you have a garage? Try parking your car inside Update: I found out the reason I couldn't loop songs on spotify was because I didn't have premium then I upgraded because they had a year's end promotion If you guys have CCTV cameras you can keep your car safe The place where I live does but we've still had a few robberies People are way too brave now This is simultaneously funny and creepy Because idk how do they find the time Multiple people maybe Mhm It's pretty much a way to get people to sign up Oh wait that news was fake so I deleted it Honestly it's worth signing up just for the audiobooks I'm busy these days so I listen to them when I'm doing an easy topic Yeah I mean. You never know when they'd be moving on to other crimes Ugh Speaking of bomb threats Freaking hate sharing a border with Afghanistan They even tried to cross the border because the Taliban don't believe in any geographical boundaries I have started staying away from news because otherwise I might get sick from worrying It's been raining constantly since yesterday send help Hate being stuck indoors My highest BMI has been 32üò¨ That's obese,but I managed to push it down to 28 with exercise and moving back home Now it's at 27 But yeah I wish it was lower I don't want to develop all the complications we read about Yess! Omg you're pretty thin I mean I look like this now That is chubby because I was wearing a hoodie and T shirt underneath HAHA yeah We generally have huge bedrooms because of the weather Like I said I live in an expensive house Aw come on it's my parents' money and both my brothers work Mhm Same I wouldn't be able to afford a place this nice at my own starting salary I can't believe I showed you all my Disney pajamas üòÇ My mom got those for me and I got a little teary Mhm THIS I look good in Saris because they suit curvy people *Sari It looks like this basically Yeah I'll be wearing one to my brother's wedding And I'm more excited for it than the weddingüòÇ March I have a lot of Eastern clothing Like lehengas etc, we love to dress up at weddings So you all would probably be seeing how I look at all 3 functions Idk if it's appropriation? We generally love to show others our culture But yeah you should probably save those for an Indian wedding Mhm,yeah using them for Halloween is sus If you like the way the garment looks, go ahead and wear one. But wearing one to halloween would feel like you're cosplaying It's more for the family but outsiders can wear one too. It's formal attire You all should stop me from sharing more pictures in ethnic clothing Hahaha okay Mhm Me too, ever since I got short hair I don't want to go longer OMG I'd run if my doctor ever did this No, seriously why would you do that to yourself Sir this is a wendy's not my body fat I'm so glad my doctor uses a normal scale Hahaha I'm just an inch taller than Poppy Honestly it's funny how she's small but packs a punch Mhm I get videos of my niece doing adorable stuff and I feel like having kids at 22 I mean, god why are kids so cute. She laughs at everything Well my country would probably be India Without colonization The subcontinent was not 3 countries before 1947 Infact my grandfather migrated from India He was a student when Partition of India happened Yeah you don't need to know much I guess. Mughal dynasty lost against the British East India Company in 1857. And that led to British rule for 90 years before both Pakistan and India got independence From what I've read, the British masqueraded as traders before colonizing this place Wohi na üòÇ Even I get confused Anyway the British were interested because of a couple of trade routes and our weather plus this area has always been very fertile agriculturally After that, the way they conquered India was by sowing discord among the Princes(by greed) and the masses, by dividing them on the basis of religion Before colonization Hindus and Muslims were pretty amicable But yeah the division still exists now to the point where we're both holding on to the past We'd be rich too. If I remember the British owed us a ton of money Yeah that was the figure I read No to mention the Koh-e-Noor diamond(in the British Monarchy) now is priceless Yes It's the same Iirc both Pakistan and India have asked for it but the monarchy says they'll have to return everything from the British museum and they didn't want to set a precedent Mountains I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yeah the Mughals were Persian This was your history lesson for the day kidsüëã Aw Yeah The Mughal empire was Islamic Mhm Islamic rulers like Muhammad Bin Qasim are hailed as heroes here Huh No Yeah I doubt that. I've heard that 23&me isn't that accurate FDA banned it in fact I'm Punjabi, apparently we're one of the oldest Indo-Aryan group of people around We have the best snacks I don't know what theory is that I don't know about that honestly. This theory has been critiqued in India that it may widen the caste divide Oh, has it been proven? I mean I'm pretty light skinned. But our area has a lot of genetic diversity Have fun! HAHAHA Oh I doubt that honestly, it's because Kashmiris live in the mountains I think it's something between north Indians and Kashmiris But yeah people just try to look whiter than they actually are The make up parlours would recommend you lightening creams and beauty products East Asians and koreans are very light skinned That's sort of why kdramas are so popular here You guys have already seen me Man I like melanin in my skin tbh. Yeah it's very light if you were in Pakistan you'd look like a foreigner Chinese And you look pretty I like you better like this, now if it was not for your eyes you'd pass as a Pakistani Mhm That's me without makeup HAHA this was the Dr Smurf outfit Im trying to not let this praise go to my head Mhm Very few people have such a beautiful smile 12 Ikr! I'm 5"3' OMG Your boyfriend is so cute! Good work viv! Y'all making me feel single rn üòÇ Ikr, the height difference gets me Same ngl But if it's a girl I want to be the tall one Yeah exactly!just a couple inches shorter Aw Premium air What's this terminology? Ohh thanks for explaining I feel like both are my type Would Eiko be considered as butch? I don't think Choices has ever done a butch LI üòÇ Please tell me you didn't wreck your car You need oil for lubricating the engine/or the brakes?? Don't judge me everyone in my family drives except for me because I have epilepsy üòê ‚ù§Ô∏è Anyway pretty sure if I didn't have it I would still hate to drive in the traffic Sem My parents thought I'd probably have a husband to drive me everywhere But yeah they taught me the basics Like, manual gear driving. If we get a car with automatic gears my parents said I could learn on that Manual driving is so difficult though Aw I remember I thought he was so scandalous for that I didn't know it was okay to have nude art classes in the west You should ignore that like the girl from big bang theory does It's surprising how many stereotypes I've never heard Aw Mhm but it sounds like a  cute one One stereotype I've heard  is that bi people hate being attracted to men The girls,that is Oh yeah I can only show my interest in men safely That's because it's illegal to be LGBT where I live. But many times I do legitimately have a crush on guys I point out And most of the women around me are homophobes so üôÇ Yeah it's terrible I can't wait to leave I've been told by one of my straight best friends that she'd marry me if I was a guy so it sucks I mean I don't think she's straight too(but the religious part)but it hurt me to hear that Yep Religion So yeah I never told her I liked her and spent a lot of time getting over her Mhm Still I think I'm fine now :) Mhm I've wondered how I'll handle her wedding but that's my problem Sorry for bringing the mood down Yeah Man I don't even know But yeah it's not enough for her to consider anything between us. And I respect her commitment to the religion even if I don't understand it. And I don't want to tell her it's not safe here tbh You're as tall as my mom viv. And that's not short don't worry about it Aw Haha my mom was so height conscious for me that she had me climb monkey bars in the playground just because she thought it'd increase my height When I was going through puberty This is a monkey bar btw Short girls are cute uwu Yeah she probably wanted me to be healthier and lose some weight I'm missing my niece more than usual today I hope your niece feels better soon Lu I got sent a video of my niece. She's pretending to eat something and amusing herself üò≠ Question for everyone: have you ever faked an interest in something just because the person you had a crush on liked it? Oh I'm glad to know that's a thing normal people do I uh,might have told mine that I want him to teach me chess I just don't find it interesting lmao, and he can't tell I'm interested in him rather than the game :IDKher: What was it if you don't mind me asking Well worst case scenario I'll learn a board game Kpop is a good interest to have Hmm what do you study? Is it human or animal anatomy? All of it? Yeah my degree includes a 2 year course on it. But it makes sense yours would be shorter Honestly anatomy is pretty humbling. You get to appreciate the intricacies of the human body as well as how much scientists worked on it. Did you know that a lot of our celebrated artists were so thorough about human proportions that they used to visit morgues to get the idea of what people should look like Also in that time many artists dabbled in medicine too. Since the curriculum regarding medicine was not as stringent as it's now Man I'm in a terrible mood today How do you guys keep your phone clean I just got a new one and would like to keep it clean because I've heard lots of microbes accumulate on it. Yeah exactly Mine's gonna go to the hospital with me so I need to be careful w this stuff Wonder when will WtD be back from hiatus I never knew a praying mantis could be so cute Probably fireflies by owl city Or OR See you again ‚ù§Ô∏è I cried to fireflies a lot when my friend died so I think it's comforting now You know in Pakistan it's a really popular snack We cook it in ashes/sand to give a smoky texture and eat it with spices and lemon Oh oof it's pretty cold here I watched and loved and cried through the whole harry potter reunion And yes JKR isn't here, we just pretend she doesn't exist Most of it was about the movies and the actors anyway I have a link Not of HBO but it's the same quality Are you OK? I'm hoping it's the weather change Can you call in sick? I hope you get tested soon lu My mom's and my brother's symptoms were really different(mom got 99*F before she got tested) and brother got about 100*F but everytime I've gotten the flu/allergies last year I've suspected it's covid but it always was negative. Yeah it's kind of hard to be in the hospital these days. I appreciate how you're dedicated to your patients so I'm hoping for good karma for you. Lu I hope you're feeling better and/or got some rest Oof me too Idk what's it about my brain that takes reading in the car as  time to feel nauseated Ikr, then I'd either open the windows and breathe out or listen to calming music I've read you can use scopolamine patches but yeah I'd rather not,it only happens if I'm on my phone a lot in the car. Yeah I also ask them to turn on  the AC Yeah I know lol Cue me looking at the rainwater droplets trying to make them race against each other Oh every time I'm in the backseat it happens! Also the weather is hot here most of the time so opening a window will give you heatstroke It's only in Dec and Jan we can sit by the fireplace we have in our house And turn on the heater in the car WHAT You should go see them, you're missing out Ok acceptable I live in a city too, but the mountains are like 4 hours away The best thing is the pressure in our eardrums,I get excited in driving through the mountains and the sickness doesn't effect me Since I look out all the time Honestly I could live in the mountains forever if it weren't for the lack of hot water and natural gas and phone signals Man I remember my brother drifting at like 140 km/h on the motor way when we got a new car Little me thought it was the best thing ever As they should be There's something sexy about a woman driving a muscle car No muscle cars are different I know Night HAHAHA What's it with people hating on stick cars Yeah ü§£ I learned to drive on a stick Oof Yeah my parents say I should learn on automatic now But I'd only be able to drive after 2 years:( True That's the interval needed to be seizure free here Having a car and being able to drive does give you a lot of independence One of my favourite cars is my mom's vitz It's small and turquoise in colour and it's better designed than the new ones they came up with What does that mean 1000cc if you're asking about the engine It's a pre 2010 model so my parents actually bought it cheaper from a doctor Ohh Make the bumper grey and the paint a deep sea green and there it is Honestly I like its interior the best Ohh I was wondering what was different I hope you have a swift recovery lu Rest and stay hydrated,eat a high protein diet And I know you already know this but please monitor your oxygen levels and take your temperature every 6 hours.

Also sushi:shijudge: :shijudge: Guys stupid question but the booster doses you all got were only 1 shot, right? Guys I'm having trouble with my perfect match answers üòÇ Submitting the quiz I mean Life does not want me to find a match Yeah it worked now Test Okay Someone telle to go study and not waste my time on a cartoon Hahaha I knew it I did the opposite dw I remember when the internet and desktop computers became extremely popular in my childhood. One of my favourite uncles(my dad's brother) used to play this song on loop
https://open.spotify.com/track/3WMbD1OyfKuwWDWMNbPQ4g?si=zwz8EMKwSjWmK0Q__EhBMw&utm_source=copy-link Today I found this song and it's passed the test of time:aww: It's the first English (not my first language so I didn't like many English songs when I was a kid and wasn't a fluent speaker) song I wanted to listen to on repeat Anyway today I realized I'm old:dopeywhat: :LMFAOdead: I was feeling that way about tooafraidtoask The med school curriculum is not much more open to the concept of different sexualities, we're taught to be non judgemental and uh, well it just says that that people who are attracted to the same sex are beneficial for evolution. My dad was oddly chatty today and told me so much trivia(what would be considered trivia now) about his childhood I sometimes get surprised by how much historical events he's seen. I learned he was alive at the time of JFK, and thought Mrs Jacquelin Kennedy was one of the most beautiful women in the world. His stories sent me down a history thread about the Kennedy family Hi I'm finally done w 2 of the most difficult exams Slept 5 hrs last nightüò© Hahaha I just woke up to see this,thanks everyone you're the best‚ù§Ô∏è What's with your mom trying to control what you do with your hair Mine can be pretty awful when it comes to lgbtia related stuff but she has never been like this when it comes to hair Ugh I'm so sorry fae You can shave off all your hair for all I care, just dye it a great colour Also I've seen you and your hair looks so cute I'm so glad you actually made a channel kyo I've gone down a YouTube/reddit/actually reading a couple of articles rabbit hole about kcstauffer, an Instagram channel about twins i used to follow a couple years back God it's so heartbreaking what happened. What's with people being addicted to fame I'm gonna rant about it in #current-events-talk How's the snow treating everyone? I saw on the news that it was really bad. I hope those of you in the US stay safe I'm glad Yikes, don't go out please Oof, I didn't even think you all would be on duty today too Okay I hate that you all are having to deal with this but it looks so pretty. I hope that power doesn't go out And get supplies in case it does I mean, we have a backup usually for electricity(but it doesn't work past 12 hours) I'm glad you do I always either have exams and/or summer break. Used to hate having summer break as a kid You can't get friends with strict parents together Now I'm too old to care lol Oh I got held back a year Lol my parents made me repeat 'prep' so I'd be eligible Honestly I think it gave me an edge, I was smarter than most kids in my level Same happened with med school. Ergo why I'll be graduating at 25 Like I applied for the one I wanted and yeah it was a little more tough to get in 5 years My program is a professional degree though Bachelor in Medicine and surgery So the non professional ones are 4 years here too And I would be bound to do one year internship. The five year professional degree take more out of you LMAO If you want to be called a medical doctor, you have to be committed to a 5 year program and a foundation year(called bachelor in Medicine and bachelor in Surgery )(MBBS) Same goes with dentists The normal bachelor programs (like biotechnology which was a backup for me, are your standard four years of undergraduate education) Yeah I've just got 1 more difficult year now Honestly the US has a longer path, students do 4 years of undergraduate*before* being admitted to medical school It's honestly a big responsibility to be responsible for human life so yeah I get why our programmes are longer And I always liked school even as a kid Yes I can, I will be taking a licensing exam tho Like the USMLE if I want to go to a residency in the US, PLAB if i want to go to the UK, and NLE if I want a residency in my own country I don't know yet No I have 2 doctor uncles living in the UK,we have a more difficult time because of terrorism and well, it honestly depends on which government is there It's true for every country now And well, brown people like me have always been discriminated against. They do say it's easier to get into britian as compared to the US Like, the people are really welcoming there because the majority of Pakistanis go to the UK to work in NHS So do most Asians It's also most expensive Compared to the UK, the prices are 10 times more So people like me who don't want to bankrupt their parents usually choose this Source: I've done more research on this than I could probably handle The UK isn't easy either, residency programs are longer and you have to pass language proficiency tests(I wouldn't need it in the US) But yeah it's really hilarious how it's only valid for 2 years and is totally redundant if you have had an English medium education since birth I'm so sorry you all lost him, he sounded like an amazing friend . May he rest in peace. Yikes I'm so glad the concept doesn't exist where I live Actually it does,in a couple of universities, but I didn't want them Somebody wrote meth instead of maths in the session goals of the study server I'm in lmao They edited it to maths so I'm sure More fun to imagine them doing meth while doing maths though Only helps you focus if you have ADHD Literally everyone knows this I always have a hard time seeing Mercury in small thermometers tho The silvery line is pretty easy to miss. But yeah I'm practicing so I don't have trouble w patients I kinda like the current one:uwu: I was thinking of Liam as #1 but you said they were LI's of color so No 2 is probably Bryce Why do I know so many descriptions of Choices LI's but not enough to get distinction in med school üò´ Me @ myself I'm so curious Man if #1 isn't Liam I'll really regret voting for him:mmNo: Also what's up w everyone voting for #3 I'd run away if a guy suggests marriage material Yeah I preferred the other LI in MOTY but I can see the attraction I don't think Choices has an ugly LI tbh Uh the cute guy w the long hair and chest hair I can't believe I forgot his name again We need more hairy LI's Mhm He had the perfect amount üòç Another LI also does, I remember Cal‚ù§Ô∏è Well chest hair is a defining character of South Asian males I doubt that I've heard many brown guys face a little discrimination in female attention because of it. But yeah I don't know one guy who doesn't On another note, a cute junior doc kinda made my mom's day, by commenting on her beauty I love people who are genuinely nice in healthcare Guys suggest some toys for a 1.5 year old I was thinking about a train set but mom says that they need a lot of work and the trains keep sliding off course Ohh Thanks viv, I'll keep those in mind when I go shopping ‚ù§Ô∏è Ngl I can see my niece doing that Today she was obsessed w a cardboard packing,it's funny how you can give them some of the most mundane things and they'd not want to play with their toys Aw I can imagine little Drew doing that There's a couple pictures of me actually eating the gift wrapping on my first birthday My brother stopped me from eating ants once But yeah I also ate mud/dry soil w a friend We only stopped eating dry mud when my brother threatened us We also climbed trees to get to the mulberry fruit in a park lmao Kids are really unhygienic lol Man I miss being a kid and not giving an F what people thought And we grew up before the Internet thankfully Also the first time I rode a bike outside, I took it straight to the road and had an accident w a garbage cart I used to sniff them And I tasted a rose once thinking it'll taste like rose water LMAO I got scolded sm afterwards My brother more than me because he was supposed to be watching and had gotten to start talking to a friend :pleb: Trust viv to top our stories Who even allowed you near legos Mine are sugar free chewable pills but they taste nice Taste so good I used to have special k cereal Now I just have weetabix for dinner Now I wish I'd voted for Bryce You're weird stop asking Man I can't believe white people came up with a day to make single people feel horrible üò´ Yeah I mean good of you to celebrate it w your SO I just think I'll take myself out to dinner/go out to dinner w my family We deserve to feel loved in our lives I'm usually not bugged about being single( rather prefer that because I can be high maintenance) and I've never looked at married couples and thought I want that And yeah med school does tend to consume your life lmao I think marriage is a good idea if you're compatible and want companionship Man I loved up LMAO drew you read my mind I never ever want a big ceremony like my brother I have anxiety I didn't cry, the last time I cried while watching the movie was TFIOS, Harry potter and the goblet of fire, and the 6th one when ||Dumbledore dies|| I have to be reeeaally invested in a movie to cry Aw I genuinely find most horror movie deaths disgusting Same :( I can't believe I missed up but I hope y'all had a good time:uwu: Yeah I was too busy sleeping üò¥

The one in #announcements Oh right i just saw the server icon Nothing nothing I figured it out Rae !!! Congratulations @red hot silly pepper  so proud so happy you're so talented you're gonna go places Yay D'Aww Such a cutie viv congratulations Hii I watched the 2002 version Didn't even know there was a new movie I've recently been watching Hindi dubbed Harry Potter with my mom She hasn't seen the series so I thought I'd get her into it. She's currently really enjoying it I refuse to be part of that group No I'm not that old Also we care about Mental health We are more open about it The things I don't like, is cancelling people without proof, and fancams and tiktok Although I have a friends born in 97 and I don't think they're old, so please don't take this the wrong way Also I genuinely don't care about people's ages, I just have lots of anxiety about missing out on life and milestones and whatever and that's where the thinking certain ages are old comes from. It's my problem Ageing is a privilege Not many people get it My grandfather was 94 when he passed away He was so young and active at heart he would still follow the news and sports from his tablet He used to walk 12 km daily in his childhood bec it was really far away from his village and he'd seen the partition of India, the 2nd world war and the 3 wars bw India and Pakistan in his lifetime. He was the best and the most jolly person I knew who could talk to a child at their level What I'm trying to say is, you are only as old as you believe yourself to be. He also knew what all his kids and grandkids were upto at any moment in time, and he had the most amazing stories to tell since he'd been to the UK on a teaching program. I understand this about having older parents my dad is 64 and mom is hitting 60 soon so I get worried about their health a lot I used to do the breathing thing as a kid a lot Plus as a kid and teenager we're more prone to making impulse decisions because we don't think a lot about the consequences, it's the fact that mostly adults see the pros and cons and like to weigh their options before making life choices so this is why it takes time to figure life out No it could be either bad dental hygiene or wisdom tooth pain If I were you I would gargle with salt water You should start flossing too The latter(wisdom tooth pain) is more likely then Nope,for me gargling took care of it, talk to your dentist if it gets worse. I was in the same position before I found out I was getting wisdom tooth pain. And it disappears after a couple days. It takes a couple years for it to really grow out enough to get it removed Obvs I'm not a dentist I'm just telling you what it could be based on my own experience. Yeah so see a dentist Gargling will too Guys Our balcony glass just shattered from the hurricane And ended up outside and in our porch Scary as hell because it was really thick and sturdy and sounded like a small explosion Guys it rained today I'm so happy Yeap Thankfully pleasant weather after a long time The hurricanes were good for something Guys there are road blockades expected in my city due to political protests and my public health department is taking us out on field trips Fingers crossed I get home early I hope they cancel it ive been meaning to guess whos been in this hospital for 2 yrs starting 3rd year and only discovered today that the library had wifi wait you're pretending not to speak the local language? has anyone watched top gun 2 can you guys tell if the movie had flashing lights? thank you so much Rae:VIP: no it doesn't, it's only flashing lights thank you for the warning anyway thanks again Rae I watched the movie and I loved it, didn't bother me at all we got a new prof in our 8 am class and he locked the door after 10 min now people keep knocking and he locked the back door too glasses I couldn't stand contacts yes, my mom's best remedy is a tbsp of honey+ a little bit of black pepper plus gargling and take some steam to keep your throat and nose from drying out this too, put ginger,lemon and  honey (for flavour) in tea and boil them. work to clear out throat thirded my niece went to watch top gun 2 I'm so proud wonder how toddlers behave in movies though the one at ours, kept quiet after the movie started can you watch something to take your mind off of it aww congratulations how old a kid has to be to graduate highschool in the US okay that makes sense thanks for telling me guys so high school seniors are basically adults I thought it was 16 oh, the age to drive here is 18 yeah I don't really think that's an issue I mean, as long as you're responsible and most teens in the US have jobs unlike here where we have kids on bikes(much more dangerous) with petrol prices rising I wish I had a job but I simply cannot manage with medschool can't wait to graduate same thank goodness we finally got a notice of summer vacations I love listening to instrumental jazz to study with I wish we had cool courses like that what degree is this supposed to be for? btw
