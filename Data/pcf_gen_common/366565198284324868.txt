hiyooo its on the to do list right next to hero 2 and mw2 cordonia doesnt have to make sense thats actually why phones are not allowed to be used on planes bc they disrupt the signals that tell other planes ur coming or vice versa either way, its a communication thing but yes usually weather is what messes with flights thats why theyre cancelled when theres a storm and people still fucking complain when their flights are cancelled or delayed its inconvenient. i get it. but this is safer, i fly often flying isnt for everyone same, rae what app fans are probably mainly a tagalog donya thing aww thanks yall
