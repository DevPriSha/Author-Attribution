Do you have any ideas in mind Pardy is back Hey Fiona Aw yeah people can disappoint sometimes ask him to redo it Where is this @Tyr Oh no Wow I had no idea feenie was that bad I'm sorry you guys have to deal with that I left the original server because I was so uncomfortable with how he treated his members tbh Calling them asshol and stuff Yes before. But I felt uncomfortable so I left because it felt more like his personal server than a choices discussion server. He would get really worked up if you didn't share the same opinions etc Oh my Well I'm glad this server has less drama I'm trying to get more active members But the Reddit page (idk who runs it) says that there's already a discord whenever I try to advertise I think so :( where did you hear about this server btw? I'm glad you joined Oh there was a post calling it out? I had no idea Oh wow I had no idea but I'm glad you're here Doge LMAO what Oh great! Whenever I post to Reddit the admins tell me that there is already an existing server and links to the shitty one ??? What did we do These aren't rumors they're actual experiences by members and I don't think you should be invalidating how badly they were treated by feenie I'm open to your input on this but TBH we've all experienced bad stuff on the feenie server so I don't understand what rumors you're talking about  @Williukea Things aren't rumors anymore when they've been experienced firsthand I'm not saying what the members who grouped up on him were right I think people were wrong on both sides. I wasn't there so I wouldn't know what fully happened but what I'm saying is these are not rumors. They're actual things that happened and they're just sharing their experiences be it positive or negative i did not see that give me a sec exactly generalizing and calling us all mean is not very civil dammit pokecord p!edirect #deleted-channel p!redirect #deleted-channel i understand hes your friend and you're no lapdog. its normal to want to defend frieds but everyone here is allowed to have an opinion thats all im saying. i respect your opinion about our server and ill do my best to improve it will you  be on vc @9k4 aww alright best of luck!!

Back in elementary, they already noticed
My habits that didn't seem very ladylike, because
Instead of Chinese garter, I played teks and jolens
And my group of friends were always the tough boys around
 
When I got to high school, I became friends with bi-
Curious women who were looking for other women
Instead of a makeup kit, I carried around a guitar
And my outfit was always a long-sleeve t-shirt and faded jeans
 
But when I met you, my demeanor changed
I learned to re-bond my hair and fix my eyebrows at least once a month
I don't know what exactly it is about you that made me soften up so suddenly
Who would've thought that it would be a guy to capture a wild tiger like me?
 
Even if I'm a tomboy
My heart will still beat for you
Just one kiss from you and I'm struck
And my ladylikeness comes to life
Like a flower that's blooming
Because you care for it with water and the peaking sun
Of your every day love*
It lights up my life**
 
When the two of us got to college, only then did I give you the sweet 'Yes"
That you worked for for 10 months
Instead of chocolate and typical efforts
You captured me with poems and your cutesy songs
 
That's why when I met you, you knew right away that it was a miracle
I learned to wear high heels and I more often wore red dresses
But you had never hoped before that I would go on to change in order to prove
That there's no hard bread with the hot coffee of your love
 
Even if I'm a tomboy
My heart will still beat for you
Just one kiss from you and I'm struck
And my ladylikeness comes to life
Like a flower that's blooming
Because you care for it with water and the peaking sun
Of your every day love*
It lights up my life** lyrics ^^^ R i g h t they even made it a tv drama yeAH like lesbians cant be converted by cute guys ok yep i was pretty fuckin mad but its so fuckin catchy OOF do u ever like hate a song but its stuck in ur head its a very very catchy song so fml ive been singing it ITS SO CATCHY grr like remember blurred lines that misogynistic song it was stuck in my head truth ITS EVERYDAY BRO nah dude ricegums songs suck too no dude pls spare ur ears ugh right @Lexa  JOIIN 😠 Oof Hey guys It's ya boi With a fever Typhoon coming Ayo Yo so many new people Yayy I have the FLU 😷 I'm your mother Yes of course Isn't Taylor also 14 Ooh I'm 12 JK I'm 21 I'm 23 I'm 24 I'm bootylicious I'm suffering from fever Is it bad to shower when u have a fever Thankies Big mcthankies from mcspankies Lmao You're road This Filipina in a reality show had a thick accent so instead of Rude she said Road And the American guy she was talking to was like wha???

"A fixture no more, the beloved feline will “graduate” from the University this March 27. Though many of us don’t remember what it is like to enter campus without Archer greeting us at the gate, his health risks are too great to allow him to stay in campus—even if we want him to stay. “We cannot guarantee he will not be fed human food which is bad for his fatty liver level,” said Professor Laureen Velasco, one of the founders of DLSU-PUSA (De La Salle University-Professors for the Upliftment for Society’s Animals)." basically he left because he got too fat rip hi fron HAHAHA it was a cute event guys he's been a fixture in our school for 5 years so people were attached i guess owo oh was it? thats smart ah yeah let me show you guys the merch stickers!! yeah, i doubt they'd give any other cat a graduation just archer i cant believe my friends went active to defend an overweight cat go 0ff friends he tried to bite me in freshman year i h8 him b y e   thank u next dogs r cooler except for the one that bit "bryce" PARDY HI hiii pardy ❤ missed u hmm feenie and our server made peace and now he's here i call it gwvfjgwufh jk idk what ur talking about princess jasmine foreign languages r fine i like seeing th funky alphabet plus i can say 我要死 altair you're chinese???

Ninki minjaj A real army understands the meaning behind the pictures. It’s all about criticizing idol life and there are also political references in the pictures, for example the number 1984, which is the name of a novel which is about perpetual war. If you look closely, you will see a big object which you would normally see behind the back of porcelain dolls to turn it a bit and make the doll speak or play a lil song. If you look even more carefully you will see, in  the closet they’re tied to something. Still didn’t get it? They’re in a closet. They look like dolls. They represent being objectified by the Kpop industry. Fake love reference: „try to erase myself and make me your doll“ everything is linked together. But this is not enough. Let’s talk about the boxes. The eyes: constantly being watched
The cameras: every move is being judged
The hands: everyone expecting and wanting something from them
The boxes: they’re captured, there’s no escape 
The photos ARE MEANT to look ridiculous. They represent a circus.
Another reference (which is highly sensitive): remember when Korean women protested against public hidden cameras, which are used to film women to put them on porn sites? The female clothes which BTS wear and the cameras could be a reference to that. 
Let’s talk about the beautiful bubble pictures. Have you noticed Jungkook is the only one whose tree is dead? And that he’s the only one who wears completely black clothes? Remember the ly her pictures? They were lying between flowers. Means, we’ve been in those unreal bubbles which isolates them from the world since ly: her. Do you understand now, that we don’t stan for our eyes to get pleased, we stan for our minds to get fucked up. If you stan for visuals, unstan. BTS is more than that. We stan for the social criticism they give us. We stan intellectuals, not visuals. Get tf out of this fandom if you can’t appreciate art and deep meanings.﻿ This is a BTS copypasta I found Kpop stans can be so toxic ngl Stan twitter is a cesspool Wait what they have lore Lore about wat Wot Oh BTS has a member that looks like the ice age baby That's cute kinda like anime U know what's odd Idols not being allowed to have gfs or bfs That's wack If they're in relationships stans be mad Bro filipino koreaboos are wack Japanese idols are creepy because they're made to look like underage girls They get girls with snaggle teeth because it looks like they're young Some get surgery for their teeth to look like that Usually jpop idols have fans that are older men and that's weeeeird Don't most of em get cosmetic surgery His what now East Asian beauty standards are wack Southeast Asian beauty standards r also wack @♡ lilli lol my cousin auditioned w her girl group and everyone liked them except Simon because he said they looked "snooty" Anywaaay she gave up on the girl group and went on to be a West End performer Yea but sucks that Simon called them snooty Wtf about them is snooty they're all women of color Wack https://youtu.be/aO2yuQkHCWU This them What is ukpop What r they Never forgetti the Filipino boy band who got cancelled for their tweet about an island Oof wrong link https://mothership.sg/2019/12/hello-sb19/ We tried explaining that Negros is a name of an island but they were like THAT WIKIPEDIA PAGE LOOKS FAKE and I'm like....

This is the perfect way to irritate your friends. If you want them to get tired of you, fast, then you should try to copy and mimic everything your friend says and does. You can either be totally obvious about it, and just repeat everything your friend says, word for word, or you can be a bit more subtle, and copy your friend's gestures and movements instead. The obvious route will be more annoying, but your friend will tire of you faster. If you mimic everything your friend does, then it'll take longer for your friend to catch on but i mean im obviously really good at everything but i mean im obviously really good at everything gasp
im your friend?
jkjk who isnt my friend me

which was my old Username but i shed that mortal form a long time ago Tattletale on every little thing your sibling does. Another classic way to irritate your sibling is to tell your parents every wrong thing he or she does. It can be really minor, like not washing the dishes when he or she said she would. Do it was often as possible and make your sibling feel like he is constantly being watched by you. If you keep this up, you are likely to irritate your parents, too![9] MOOOOOM HP SAID SHUT UP MOOOOM DREW IS GONNA SACRIFICE HP MOOOOOOM HP SAYS YOU DONT CARE MOOOOM ALTAIR SAID THE F WORD MOOOM HP SAID THE F WORD MOOOOM ALTAIR IS DITCHING US OH FUCK MY MOM IS GONNA SEE MY TATTOO OK TIME TO YEET BOYS _GOD VIV OUT_ Go big or go homo My dog ditched me to sit on my dad's lap Fuckin betrayed Sad She don't love me I'm not caught up on rwby but p sure two of them are in lesbians with each other Yang and Blake or sth Which is p sad because I liked Sun 🤘 Yes Jk no yang has big pp Bigger pp Fuck my boss got mad Bc we brought the dogs to the office 👀 The exterminator is fumigating the house what am I supposed to do woa @Altair so we are deleting all name roles in favor of #color-role-channel ? sweet Yo u know whose voice reminds me of @Water Puppies 's ??

There, a sadistic remote-controlled bear by the name of Monokuma announces that the students will be forced to live in the school forever, offering only one way to graduate: murder another student and get away with it. When a crime scene is discovered, a "class trial" (学級裁判, gakkyū saiban) is held, in which the remaining students must discuss amongst themselves who the murderer is. If they can successfully figure out who murdered the victim, the culprit alone will be executed. However, if they guess incorrectly, the culprit will be able to leave the school and everyone else will be executed. ok who wants to join the game i will put your name into the simulator ok bread is in who else this is like the hunger games sim except its a killing game hello :< ok nvm i guess everyone be busy another time  then okieee so we have bread, lilli, jordan, furi, mango and viv OOO any last minute additions? no? ok we begin o shit ok lemme add u OK THIS IS THE LAST ONE WE START AFTER I ADD HILDA kk Here we go WAIT WTF Why are there 2 Lillis Bdndnbdjsj .....

All of these creatures maintain a code of secrecy, not allowing the human race to be aware of its existence due to lethal altercations throughout history.  Night People are governed by laws. Authoritative bodies such as the Night World Council make sure these laws are followed to prevent humans from knowing the Night World exists. A human who finds out about the Night World or its people should be killed according to these laws.

The Night World allows for the torment, conversion and killing of human beings, within reason and with permission, though for the most part the citizens of the Night World are indifferent to humans. However, there are two consistent cardinal laws: humans cannot be told of the Night World, and it is illegal to fall in love with one.

The novels focus on instances in which these two main laws, punishable by death, are broken. yeah elementalists literally... lifted the plot to twitches the disney movie sun and moon twins separated at birth with twitches plot yes alsooo did some movie steal some shit from TRR?? i saw some screenshots unless those were fake no like they legit had a guy named liam from cordonia i saw some screenshots of that on tumblr Found it Lmao bruh :(( so many ppl in my area r getting the virus yeah 😦 like rly nearby no bc the philippine government sucks ass lmao yes @DaHomieDrew  😦 my grammy is 84 im rly scared for her she lives in my house sigh and i have a sore throat rn sooooo https://tenor.com/view/bettywhite-dab-gif-5044603 nois what r the symptoms anyway my grandma always gets pneumonia Pre-existing illnesses that put patients at higher risk:

They were privileged enough to have their family safe from Marcos. It really makes me sick that Ferdinand Marcos is buried in the same cemetery as my SOLDIER grandfather who actually fought for our country rather than steal from it. Truth ?????

I've seen people enter with courses their parents chose for them and they were fucking miserable. Some even ended up dropping out. Your major should be something that interests you! Yesss My parents made me do pre-med and.... I did not do well and I was sad I shifted to psychology and won awards for my research work!! You thrive when you're having fub Fun So yeah choose a major you love Because it's not work if it's fun ALSO make sure you check ratemyprofessor before signing up to any classes Some profs are .... Difficult Like some are really old and set in their ways and no matter how hard you try, they still give low marks. And that's definitely not your fault So yeah check out your profs Oh god one of my profs HATED me And he was the only prof teaching that subject so of course I had to take it He gave me a 2.0 and I was like u know what I'll take it @CoolCCMystery do u have a major in mind Maybe I could help you find one Ooh! English is great, if you're into literature I hear comparative literature majors make a lot of money.

Culinary is also super fun, my cousin graduated culinary arts. You do need balls of steel though because your profs are Gordon Ramsey levels of intense. Also you'll burn and cut yourself by accident.

Helping kiddos is super fun! You could go into teaching or special education! Special education is super fulfilling :) I'm going to take a postgrad in play therapy. I also have a part time job tutoring kids with autism :) Yeah I teach them English They're sweet, sometimes they're just cranky because they'd rather stay in bed all day. @Raven didn't u wanna do med Pre med was intense but it was p fun ngl I was in pre med for 2 years You could also do different kinds of science courses! @Deleted User no but I think Sloane is computer science major Sloane from perfect match ?? MCs are bums with no jobs tbh Lmao Most of them at least Besides OH MC The rest have jobs but active social lives and good sleep??? Girl HOW It's a specialization right My uncle is an epidemiologist He's pretty cool he won some American medicine award or something Roux award for medicine or some shit We had no idea what he won for but yay good job I think it was public health related 🤷 He doesn't practice medicine tho He's a researcher Though he only treats patients who are family so that's me lok Lol I think MD MSc  @ill miss you rae Yeah idk what that was but one time he had to help someone on a plane when they asked if there was a doctor on board That was epic Ooh I'm uh just a bachelor's degree holder 😢 Wahh I plan on post graduate studies tho My uncle always treats me because in always sicc Oooh good luck  @MaxShadows I have dyscalculia So I'm always amazed by people who can do math Dyscalculia is wack I can't do mental math And I can't read clocks M a t h _yeets because math makes me nervous_ Good night people No it's 3:45 I gotta sleep anyway Good luck max!!!

He was growing in my garden and I
Pulled him out by his hair like a weed
But like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So I figured this time I might as well let him be
Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend this song reminds me of my sister. she's a really grumpy antisocial weird goblin but i love her. hmm @DaHomieDrew  reminds me of this song https://open.spotify.com/track/3JvrhDOgAt6p7K8mDyZwRd?si=IIiaeUkcSfih2ZsdJwRMYQ HILDA WHY O LAWD maybe for me, it'd be

the best friend responded "i don't know, i'm in a room and they're splitting us into groups" my uncle said "are you ok" and the best friend said "i have no regrets. i have to go now, they're leaving." my uncle figured oh he's probably drugged up bc of the anesthesia so he called his best friend's sister and said "hey i heard the surgery was a success, could you go check on him? he's a little loopy." the sister said "what are you talking about? he died at 12:15pm on the operating table" and my uncle was like https://tenor.com/view/no-wack-not-funny-hannibul-gif-5760013 w a c k ok another one my uncle was on a trip to some remote province and he booked a room in a really old spanish era mansion he saw this woman and her husband and they were in the room next to his, they were friendly and stuff he noticed nobody else would talk to them though also the couple dressed pretty weird like this anyway he just shrugged it off at 5am he woke up and decided to take pictures of the sunrise so he went to the shore and started snapping pics he's a photographer btw anyway he saw the couple make their way towards him and they said they were on a morning stroll the woman tripped over some rocks and he caught her by the arm and it was cold as ice and hard as stone then my uncle was like https://tenor.com/view/ight-imma-head-out-spongebob-imma-head-out-ima-head-out-gif-14902967 so he checked out of the mansion and the maid in the mansion saw him leaving and then he asked her who the couple next door was and where they're from and the maid said "sir that room is empty" then he was like ok wtf so before he left he snapped some photos of the mansion and he saw a framed picture of the same couple he saw at the beach so he asked the maid "hey, who's that" and she was like "the original owners of the house. they died before WW2, why?" and then my uncle yeeted back home the end for what it's woth tho, all the spirits he'd met were friendly i've sensed spirits too but less friendly ones fuck i cant see them, i can feel them i can feel their cold hands on my body lmfao i havent had sex in a month i went to this farm once and i came across an old hut inhabited by a native around half a century ago i came close to it but i felt really cold, like you know the cold when you open the freezer so i stepped back and i felt something jump and latch on to my leg like cold and tight it hurt and there were scratch marks my uncle (the photographer) saw this and shooed him away and then it stopped but i had scratches all over my legs i cant see and i cant communicate but i can definitely feel them oh oK ONE LAST GHOST STORY this time its from me ok so my chinese family lived in a really old mansion for the longest time and i stay there on weekends sometimes this is the first time i saw ghosts yall i went up to get a glass of water and i saw an elderly woman by the balcony she was fat and she wore a floral dress and she had a large fan she was speaking our native cantonese dialect i was like uhh ok wtf im too sleepy for this shit there was an abandoned room in that house it was the size of a walk-in closet another chinese woman emerged from that room and she was a really small lady, she walked with a limp i was like ok fuck that so i went back to bed i thought it was a dream for years bc id keep seeing them at the house so one time i told my dad about it and he was like "you're describing my grandma and her sister. they used to live here and they died here." and then i never slept in that house again dfghjkl; whAT but y how old r u btw y did u smash when she had a bf damb she needed tp cheat? wot wym weak oh god well i cant say shit i dont use condoms either thats why every month we play the IS VIV PREGNANT GAME but like, i have PCOS so my chances of having kids are lower and idk he's my bf of 7 years so its ok if i do have his baby u dun goofd my dude did you at least pull out ok good damb yall crazy sdfghjkl;' wHAT the fuck yall dont take breaks ughhhhhh im so pent up role given i have no basis for comparison since ive only slept with 1 guy but it's pretty good ok sex talk goes to #nsfw-chat hilda is a babey hey man sex is great DFGHJKL SHHHHH bread help https://tenor.com/view/community-donald-glover-troy-barnes-fire-flames-gif-4066536 this is bread who is them who wants the role @Deleted User you can now access #nsfw-chat me im turning 23 o no he's our princess can someone pls make fanart of princess furi sweet i cant draw im 23 in july im 1997 man im old i wanna make princess furi fan art but i cant draw for shit im tryna draw now lets see if its any good good luck bready woo BRO I asked my sister to draw @Tyr  as a princess and oh my gid She did that in 7 minutes Art school is wack noah fence but my sister has been having a hard time acclimating to her campus in the US According to her, everyone is so sensitive.

If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's sleep, you might have sleep apnea. The main types of sleep apnea are: Obstructive sleep apnea, the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax. People of Asian descent tend to have more severe obstructive sleep apnea than Caucasians of similar age and BMI. The findings are especially alarming because the Caucasians in the sample tended to be much more overweight than their Asian counterparts https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20100309/sleep-habits-vary-by-ethnicity-survey-finds Yooo tag urself Wow 71% of black people in the poll prayed before bed Damn And only 18% of asians pray before bed How do people remember to pray I just pass out I never remember trying to fall asleep I just die on my bed for like 4 hours My family makes fun of the way I sleep It's rude as fuck I sleep w my mouth open And sometimes I sleep with my eyes open And then I wake up and there are pictures of me sleeping in the group chat and my family members are doing various poses in them U know Now that I think about it Maybe I do have a sleep disorder People say I convulse in my sleep What's urs BECAUSE IM INNOCENT KYO also my psychiatrist gave me 500mg of Xanax and I still couldn't sleep rip She gave me benadryl but apparently I'm allergic And benadryl is for allergies So I'm allergic to the  anti allergy medicine I did a thing when I was a kid where they hospitalized me to watch me sleep And they attached some electrodes on my head Yeah and they tried making noise And I was still dead asleep My nurse told me I could sleep through the apocalypse It rly is uncomfortable :/ How do u even sleep w those things on your scalp It's gross Sleep disorder gang Helicopter parents r d worst God I'm working from home and I'm supposed to text and call people to coordinate for my project etc And my parents claim I'm not working because "I never see you working" GOD Omg ILITW is god tier Ugh I miss those books @BigHutchHO do u know about that viral video of the Scottish man who was stuck on the roof @BigHutchHO https://youtu.be/HpVhSx0fZwM I died Jdkdhdke I lost it when he said wank stain You know when I see Scottish characters they're usually really angry all the time Is that accurate Question Do u have to pay to keep threep Was threep a diamond choice Or does he just join you I forget Also what's the password It's 7:43 am and I don't wanna think Nani the fuck What's an axiom Do u guys even read lore tablets I don't bother because it's so fucking long and boring I wish they presented it in a way that's less boring Looks like a shitty text story Oh man I'm leaning towards Tyril now he's such a soft babie Also ghost elf lady is hot 10/10 would smash YO WHAT THE HELL FUCKING JUMPSCARE In this chapter It's the elf thing after Tyril reads kayas letter Bro wtf This lady in Michigan went on strike because they closed the hair salon and she wanted to get her hair done What the fuccccck is wrong with America Look at the first few seconds of this vid @azula https://youtu.be/wlBYHk4n4dU Wtf why'd I tag myself Anyway The lady protesting about her hair is in the first few seconds Jesus Dude they're being selfish "The sick people are already being taken care of, we need to get our hair done" To be honest the lockdowns in America aren't even that strict???

“We finally get it at the — whatever it is — 50th take, and we’re so happy, we can feel it, at this point in the dialogue, Jon and I. We’re at the corner, and it turns green, and we’re able to keep walking, and a fucking cab has hit us,” Hoffman explained, pausing for the crowd’s laughter.  

“The truth is, this is the way the brain works: What was in my head was, ‘We’re makin’ a movie here!’ And then just as I’m about to say that, I realize, ‘Oh, you can’t do that,’ the brain changes it to, ‘I’m walkin’ here!’ What was really being said, for me, was, ‘We’re shooting here!’” https://youtu.be/c412hqucHKw I fuckin screamed that was an actual can driver who yelled at him Cab I wonder if he knows he's in a famous movie bruh did DS release wah i lost track of days bc im on lockdown anyway our easter was last wk oh i wasnt aware there were 2 i didnt know u were christian hmm u mean the bunny part wtf why are the witness mc outfits so tacky just like her personality @oge  do you watch disney films welcome back!! does anyone come from a country whose 1st language isnt english i have a question @Deleted User are the movies from hollywood translated well @oge  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVY87YohJv0 do you think this one is good for a translation or does something feel off and @Deleted User  what about this>? considering this movie takes place in india https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90yDFh7Ihs i am curious because in our country all the movies are in english they dont bother translating it oki its around the same for bear necessities i think i found the wording so cute our heart needs very little to feel satisfied so cite cute IS ANYONE AWAKE HOW THE FUCK DOES BASEBALL WORK ok uh i fucked up my first softball thing for OH is there a second I CHOSE LEAP BECAUSE I CANT SPORTS so uh is there another choice baseball isnt big where im from ive never seen a real game uh is there a second choice or did i already fuck it up UGHHHH damn u western sports oh ok thats fine then wait so am i gonna fuckin lose the only sport ive ever done was muay thai and that isnt even a team sport yes 2d oh ok i won nice ty guys @BigHutchHO oh a lite? oh wow thats.. too cheap 150 is like switch lite price isnt it yeah idk id be wary! but if it's real, then omg go for it what a steal i got my switch rly cheap off fb marketplace nicee i also suggest pokemon shield, animal crossing & smash ultimate !! games are hella expensive but the nintendo online shop has sales a lotta games on the eshop are on sale rn get shield!! oh im glad u guys were able to work it out the americans are probably asleep does anyone want a custom icon i just learned to use photoshop @Deleted User  like a profile pic yea like this okay samples of what ive done photoshop! uhh clipping mask playing with the colors do u want one @literal legend. who do u want it of? poppy? cupcakke? ok!! @literal legend. is this ok omg cute tell me if u want me to make more ok @literal legend. do u want me to make it smaller so the square fits in the discord thing or do u like it zoomed in ok what are the dimensions even @literal legend.  does this work? made it smaller so they could see the square test https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/ I got Loki & Jack Sparrow as the highest Yayyy I got Loki, Jack Sparrow & Azula lol do u ever just drink too much water and ur bloated for the rest of the day Ugh this lockdown is killing me Literally our lives are on hold I'm supposed to be focusing on my career I was about to accept a job as a teaching assistant for a special needs center UGHHHH What's that  @BigHutchHO Whaaa Yogurt balls I like Froyo Man I'm watching white chicks for the first time in 10 years Still good shit are there any new releases next month or nah Oh wow They're calling out the spoiler people https://twitter.com/PlayChoices/status/1252307326393937920?s=09 Also seriously?

Go sit there until you chill." Bruh I picked a fight with someone on twitter because they weren't making sense Like at all Some girl tweeted that all the issues in the Philippines were stressing her out and she wanted to move to Canada And he started bashing her and saying she was selfish because there are poor people in the Philippines and she's gonna ditch them Like ???????? If u have an opportunity for a better life, why aren't u allowed to take it???? That is true He said she was selfish because she is moving to have a better life for her and her newborn baby And like... Opportunities don't come to everyone and that's why they're so valuable. Why are you guilt tripping a teen mom for wanting free healthcare for her son ? TRUTH thats just like saying "Why are you eating??? You know some people can't afford food, right?" likeee make it make sense is anyone here naturally thin @Deleted User IRRFAN KHAN DIED IM SO SAD Damn :( fuck im sad i was such a fan of his hollywood work #announcements !! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjO_xBGvrPI this shit looks hilarious we need historical fiction comedies on choices :(( did u watch the trailer @DaHomieDrew its kinda like a parody DFGHJKL i want a parody of historical figures yay pls nia or mal they're both gorgeous :(( Uhh those who play OH2 I have a question on #open-heart oooo interesting!!! ive always wanted to visit india i wanna try authentic indian food curry is like my absolute favorite food ever and ive had authentic thai, japanese and chinese curries. i just need to try indian curry. omg!! yes i'll def hit u up! i have a friend from india who goes to college in delhi but idk where that is i have a low spice tolerance i mean the site looks like they can actually speak english properly but who knows chapters has horrid grammar u know these names are ripoffs of choices and it just turns me off o god true also can choices tell if im modded if i message them thru the app bc they told me to message them thru the app and im afraid of getting zucced uhhh ok let me call my tech bae @Strife HELLO BOSS @Strife can choices tell if I'm modded when I message them thru the app Yay ty  @Strife Is originals any good Hmm Is that APK modded or nah Who's the developer AW MAN :( Uhh I downloaded it and it says can't open file Ree O Is that safe Happy birthday @Catherine @leitgo65 BOOOOO Ok hold up I wanna put up a tech support channel And I want a pingable tech support role But idk who would actually wanna be in that role Ah man 10 dollars a month or a one time payment Oop Umm if they're charging u might as well just buy from the app lmfao #announcements ye cause some newcomers dont know about the mod or how to download the apk so i figured we'd move that there oooo thats a good idea priy and i guess the ping is a last resort u can if you're free! pls dont  feel obligated thanks priy!!! @Blattella  hello r u up Happy birthday @kaitoo !!!!! do we have any south asian members here besides priy and zee she's both ohh no im not saying australia is in asia ohh i was asking bc i saw a trailer for a documentary and i wanted to know your opinions on it ive been studying cultural psychology while on lockdown so i just wanted to know oh ok so do you know about the simpsons? someone made a documentary about an indian character named apu and people got rly mad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGzvEqBvkP8 they said it was racist and offensive but like among the south asian community, i see an even split between indians finding it funny and indians finding it offensive the youtube video has lik 24k dislikes lmao idk, i always saw apu as like a hard working immigrant father but i can understand why people are put off by the accent especially since a white guy is playing him @MaxShadows  oh no worries, i didnt think u were priy, what about PB's depictions of indians make you upset sorry i dont play HSSCA who was the indian character on CA ive only played CA book 1 and i completely forgot ahhh stereotypical how? by looks? oh yeah that makes sense fghjkl i grew up next door to an indian neighbor and they're super nice he has a daughter named priya haha omg now i miss uncle hiro 😦 hope he's ok. he moved away and when i last saw him he gave me free eyeglasses (he's an optometrist) he was born and raised in the philippines but i think he was arranged to marry a woman in india. he brought her over here and she's lived here for years now. i can tell she misses india. makes sense. i had no idea india was so diverse. not necessarily some are consensual it's an east vs west kinda thing yes true well only in the REALLY bad countries where they do some questionable stuff usually ur family asks before they set u up with someone at least in modern day china this is a very asian thing western countries usually prioritize individual freedom and asians prioritize the good of the family or clan. neither one is wrong or right. just a cultural observation like in china and other east asian countries, we don't tell the elderly that they have terminal illnesses lmao i cant leave until im married ughhh man i envy western couples who can live w their SO before marriage tho that seems great but also my parents pay for my food, electricity and clothes when i live w them so im fine being a freeloader until marriage dfghjkl; mhm but i have to have babies my dad will be heartbroken mY DAD ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO HAVE KIDS AT 24 bro thats next year... idk in my country and in east asia in general they kinda talk shit about u if ur a woman who never married which sucks doge, are u 16?

When I heard my little cousin was playing Witness I was floored Oh god That was meant as a threat No they'd be like OH GOD MY EYESSSS Btw I sent choices a message Hi choices. I have a concern regarding your new book cover and your more adult-oriented books in general. I want to preface this by saying I love your game and I've been a long time fan since the beginning. 

I and many other fans have noticed the shift in adult-oriented content. Which is fine, I mean you do you. Facebook moms need to be appeased and all that. However, what concerns me is that there is a considerable amount of minors who play Choices. That being said, I feel like your more "racy" books should be placed in their own section, or at least have an AGE warning. 

My second concern is the cover of The Nanny Affair. I have a thirteen year old cousin who plays the game and her other friends play it too. I am uncomfortable with the very provocative cover being seen by her and the many other underage fans of Choices. The woman is half naked and straddling a man. If possible, could you come up with an alternative cover or at least hide it from children's eyes? 

I love Choices very much and I look forward to your new books. I just hope we make it a safe place for fans of ALL ages. I wish you all the best and hope you all keep safe, especially in this pandemic. They better though, this has to do with children. They could get in trouble with whoever does their game ratings @Jinii Minii I messaged the FB page. Is there another page where I can tell them stuff? Damn They don't reply on Instagram They've only ever replied to me on FB Oh I can't DM them on twt Y'all will see my twitter handle bdksbdkk I'm fine w Facebook Ugh This makes me v uncomfortable Exposing this to kids and all that The warning didn't even state what AGE they should be when reading It just said warning: seks Like ??? YASS COME THRU @Jinii Minii I want my boyfriend I haven't seen him in months yeah but if he plays games all day instead of talking to his girlfriend, DO I REALLY 😂 I think that's the reason why he bought me a Switch Lite tbh. So I'd play all day and not notice that he's not paying attention to me 😒 @Raven what prank Y'all think PB made the kids twins to save money? HAHAH Hdkdbdjkshksbdhsjsgd Omg But nobody talks like that here Someone please do one in a Filipino accent Question Does having drivers make you rich in the US? Oh I think around Asia it's standard to have maids, nannies and drivers Ooh in China, girls bind their feet to show they don't need to walk and their servants carry them. My grandma actually escaped that tradition by moving to the Philippines And now she has a generation of descendants with big feet lmfao I agree, most of the rich people in the Philippines are insensitive and entitled. But even middle class families have at least a maid Yeah I mean minimum wage over here is v cheap And they live with us usually so we provide food, lodging, toiletries, money and days off. Sometimes we help send their kids to school Hdkdvkejje NO not servants We call them helpers I'll admit tho, some people treat their helpers poorly Which breaks my heart really I have so much respect for people in the service industry Ugh my uncle treats his like fucking slaves and it breaks my heart There's no please or thank you It's just like "Open the gate NOW. Are you stupid?? Hurry up." And I'm like holy fuck I make sure I give his maids extra Christmas gifts just for putting up with him Eh he's so nice to people at his "level" But I think the real test of character is how u treat people who work for you My mom grew up poor so I'm not into that rich kid shit Yes he is It sucks because his maids and nannies are the sweetest He has a daughter with special needs and they treat her well Ding ding ding Ye Honestly though, rich people can be gross. I'm glad my mom grew up poor Naw tbh he is more feminine than his wife He's a stay at home dad while his wife brings home the money He doesn't subscribe to toxic masculinity Which is good He never worked a day in his life though, he's a trust fund baby Actually none of my dad's in-laws have ever worked in their life Except for my mom 🥺 Now she's senior VP of one of the biggest corporations in the country and earns more than my dad so I'm very proud of her She really worked from the bottom Go mom Mom deadass made me believe we were poor Like the first 11 years of my life Which honestly helped a lot because I don't like designer clothes and bags And I'm like the cheapest bitch evet Ever GDKSBFJDJ same My mom carrying a Gucci bag: No, Viv. You can't have a barbie doll. We don't have money. Bdksbdjd My mom's mom was a child born in WW2 and she never finished elementary school. She became a dress maker and she married a soldier So like I guess my mom wanted me to grow up with humility too Ugh the nanny affair is... Actually better than Witness but I can't get over the fact that it's so unprofessional Lmfao I kinda squirm too thinking about how it's an AFFAIR I'd be horrified if my bf was boinking his kids' nanny And of course they make Sofia out to be a bitch so people root for the cheater If he cheated on Sofia he will cheat on MC Plain and simple What makes MC think that Sam respects their relationship when he couldn't even commit to his fiance Ok rant over It's just as someone who's been in a relationship for 7 years it really irks me how irresponsible these two characters are Well, almost 7 years. It'll be our anniversary in July and I doubt I'll even see him :( Wtf No it's not Vsksvdjebd My deepest fantasy is being able to eat without gaining weight I hate FB mom's Moms*** They're so racist and homophobic on the FB group They don't even try to hide it Tbf they actually pay for the game I remember when they revealed Charlie for the DS sneak peek a lot of them were like "EWWW a lesbo??? Where's the boy?" Like shut up charlie is hotter than you'll ever be Susan @Ne-Rwby-On choices has a fan club on FB and it's composed of 40 year old mothers They adore baby bump and other wedding books Like ???? U already have kids and a husband so like plan your own damn wedding or get pregnant idc Idk some people don't even know the FB group exists They're hella racist too When the DS cover came out they rioted because the pirate on the cover wasn't blonde with blue eyes Like stfu Jennifer What do u mean I'm in the group Gdjsjdj Yes @DaHomieDrew I see u And I hate how they're like IF U DONT LIKE BABY BUMP THEN DONT READ IT DUHHHHHHHHHH Don't tell me what to do Geraldine @DaHomieDrew it's usually in d comments Someone posts a pic of the cover/LIs and you get a bunch of angry moms in the comments Also maybe 35% of the people commenting are filipino and I'm not surprised Ugh There are FOUR nations of the fandom Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit and Discord Everything changed when the FB moms attacked FB moms - hate POC and gay characters, love wedding and baby books

Tumblr - LOVE gay characters and shit on generic white LIs 

Reddit - Doesn't really care about that stuff, more focused on theories and lore + PB updates

Discord - YOHO YOHO A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME Thanks I've been in all the nations I must say tho Tumblr has the funniest memes I'm in all of it Tho I lurk on FB and Reddit PB replied Thanks for the feedback, Redacted. Rest assured that we'll share this with the rest of the team. @kyo was my description accurate Of course it's FB They pay Those chumps use iPhones and don't know what APK means Man I hate the Facebook moms Look what they've done to choices Ugh Truth my bro I can't believe they killed it lives Just when I started to become relevant to the plot I being joss Joss queen Make joss and LI People are so rude cancelling Joss like that I was a bully in high school Now I'm not I'm a bully at work jk Viv is Jocelyn and Viv works for Choices were old jokes only OG server members know about Aka Doge, Benji, GB, zee, etc Oof I deadass miss the psych ward now that they shut it down REEEE But yeah, if you noticed I was rarely on the server in 2019, that is why.

If u go outside u die. And even if u don't die u end up killing someone's grandma Hi hyper Also my doctor just told me not to go outside at all because I can't wear a mask :WTFthonk: Nah nah I didn't mean to phrase it as a hasty generalization I mean some Americans Others r p cool I'm ok, I just have a heart problem and I don't get enough oxygen in my body in general So like I can't wear a mask for too long Hdkdhdkdjd My sister studies in the south and she says people are generally nice and polite But eh it rly depends on which area in the south She told me people in Atlanta were generally rly mean to her Some guy saw her and my dad and started filming them like on selfie mode And she was like... "Can I help you?" And the guy was just like "Can you say hi" I have no idea what he's done w that footage but that was weird Also she gets a fair share of racist white parents (she's a school tour guide) but other than that, people in her area r p chill. My dad pulled her out of school tho bc he was afraid of Asian American targeted violence but she told me that usually happens in the east or west coast 🤷 Idk bskde that's what she said But :0 I really doubt schools will let kids in this year anyway They are projecting that students may return by August or September but that's a little too hopeful Hahaha tbh 😂 I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family It's driving me insane and everyone I know has been getting a Tik Tok account and I don't wanna be next > like, i hate these people
> like i love them
> but holy shit
Mood Nah they're like MAKING Tik toks of them dancing Also I just discovered POV tiktoks exist and it made me wanna jump off a bridge Some tiktoks r cool ig like the ones w actual original content Plus I can never focus on therapy over zoom because my therapist set her background to a photo of the beach and it distracts the hell out of me And I told her to remove it but she said she didn't know how dhksbdkdnd I miss my boyfriend His hair is SO long now. He hasn't had a haircut in months. It's forced LDR the only interaction I enjoyed today was when my cat brushed up against my leg And like he doesn't do that ever idk why he did that Dude I had a kitten and the vet said it was a girl so I named her bianca 9 months later SHE HAS BALLS We can't even change her name anymore bc she's so used to Bianca @Ne-Rwby-On  I suggest you see a therapist on zoom My cats actually come when I call them by their names Wack They do that little trot thing Hsjshdjsb Cats r brats I have a black cat named Monty A few months ago he got bit in the ass by a neighbor dog I thought he was gonna die BC we couldn't find him anywhere and when we did, he already lost a lot of blood. But we took him to the vet anyway and he got his ass stitched up and now he's fine Lmao He really had a bite mark on his butt I love black cats so much tho, they're so elegant. Orange ones r cool too @Water Puppies  you have two cats right I remember you sending a pic of two cats Oh wow What kind of cats do u have They're really furry My cats r just alley cats Aww Which one is the new one Was he a kitten We have a shit ton of cats back at my university and they'd randomly attack people for no reason Ah nice Kittens are v cute But man cats r assholes My cat woke me up once by showing me his bootyhole Like I just felt his tail on my nose and I woke up and I just saw his bootyhole Tbh tho I say I like dogs better but my new dog is basically a cat She's a brat and she throws tantrums when she wants something and ignores us when we wanna hug her Then when we're busy and she wants attention she will either bark at us or bite us We r simps My dad tried to walk our cat once Idk what he was thinking But the cat was upset and it started clawing at his leg and that was the end of that Oh god the cat was so upset It refused to look at him for a week Didn't they suspect that his appearance was made by a body double I don't understand how they'd benefit from hiding his death His sister is a literal clone who's just as ruthless Also @kyo I hope u find one!!

Yeah They were fired but I think murder charges should be given out The Philippines Yep Definitely. They should rot in jail. It's so disturbing. I have African-American relatives in the US (in-laws) and I feel for them, I really do. They're absolutely terrified of police I can't imagine fearing for my life whenever I see people who are supposed to protect me It's so unfair I don't think he got beaten, he was choked. The officer put his weight on him Yeah People were screaming at the cop to get off him Yeah They were telling at the cop yes Even a firefighter told the cop to back off and check for the pulse Sigh Why do it be like that Ye Incompetent as fuck Ah, I hate that Karen White people pretending to be hurt when literally the black person is standing right next to them and hasn't touched them at all Even I'll acknowledge that as an East Asian, we are not as discriminated against by the police because we have fairer skin tones and that's messed up. Dog was taken by a rescue too It's really colorism It fucking sucks Did you hear about Karamo from Queer Eye They did a prank on him while he was driving and he nearly quit the show Police Idk they thought it would be funny and the production crew knew all about it https://www.bustle.com/p/tan-france-almost-quit-queer-eye-you-actually-watched-the-moment-play-out-without-knowing-it-9034664 "I whipped out my phone so fast to start recording [the incident]," Van Ness recalled to Entertainment Weekly, "and I did not know we were getting pulled over. I was super-duper uncomfortable." After Brown got out of the car, the "set-up" was revealed, but he and France — who is British-Pakastani and the only other person of color on the show — were furious. It's not a good prank Yep And the white boomers who protested lockdown didn't get the tear gas I wonder why Right? So many people are convinced that this doesn't happen anymore but it does every day Yeah, I hear British police are much less of a threat Yeah. No guns and less instances of brutality. Yeah... American cops are yikes I remember a cop coming up to me when I was in the US and I fucking cried because I was so scared True there still are incidents All over the world really There's this Netflix movie called American Son that everyone should see. @Andromeda pls put the R word on spoilers But yeah I heard about that Man even south and Southeast asians aren't that safe. It really has to do with the color of your skin. Yep. Pretty much. I'm in that gray area between pale and tan so I never really know what I'm gonna get @literal legend.  mood Southeast Asian and East Asian I don't even know if I would be considered dark skinned in the west I'm considered dark over here in Asia TRUE @literal legend. And yeah Chinese people are racist Wait, Americans/Europeans I'm gonna show you a picture of me can you tell me if I'm considered pale or tan in your country ? Thank you! The beads are Chinese good luck charms So yeah would I be considered dark where you're at Ah yeah when I was in the UK there were very little East Asian people Some teenagers picked on my family In the tube :/ They were patting our heads and laughing at us They thought we couldn't speak English I had enough and I said "Touch me again and I'll break your fucking fingers" And they ran off It's alright. My dad got most of the teasing since he's 100% Chinese and looks like he can't speak English. My dad said "They're doing this because we are colored" and that was really sad to hear Tbh my family is fucking terrified of white people They don't say anything when white people are rude Because 
1. They're physically bigger and stronger 
2. Police will listen to them, not us Oh god I had someone say Nihao to me in the Philippines I nearly whooped his ass It sucks being mixed in general. I'm not accepted in either race. Chinese think I'm too filipino, Filipinos think I'm too Chinese Like WHERE DO I GO THEN Gang gang 👊 Omg Truth Salt and pepper as seasoning Man why are white people so tall My dad is 5'4 My mom and sister and I are 5'2 Ugh that's not always the case Omg I took a white friend out for Asian food and he asked if it was spicy and I was like "nah" And he was fucking dying he said it was so spicy Like ....no it isn't The menu said it was no spice but idk I don't even have a great tolerance for spice tbh I absolutely love South Asian food but I die on the inside because it's so spicy Korean and Indian food are like the spiciest I absolutely love Shahi Paneer, tikka Masala & butter chicken Ugh it's so good 😩 and even their vegetarian dishes?? Like they can get bland vegetables and turn them into flavorful dishes Right? Ugh I love it so much. Curry is my favorite food in general. Japanese, Indian, Thai All great Truth!!! I hate how people think of Asian food as dumplings and rice there's so much more!!! I grew up next to Indian neighbors and omg they had the best food and they were so fucking nice. The mom even gave me a henna tattoo pen that are used by brides. Right? She showed me the ones she had when she got married it was beautiful They were Hindu, they had statues all over the house. They absolutely loved how I appreciated their culture since most east asians discriminate against them. I honestly find Indian culture to be beautiful down to their religions and architecture and food. What a colorful place What's up Rice usually What about you? Is there anything other than rice??? OH I would eat Naan too but it's so hard to find over here :( They always serve it with rice where I'm at Yeah! I have tried roti with curry before though and omg it's life changing. True! They usually have frozen/instant ones that aren't good :( You can't be Asian and not own a rice cooker When I was in the US for a month I cried because I missed rice Like the soft white rice 🥺 Right? It's so weird and dry and thin I like thicc rice Omg controversial opinion but I hate thick noodles I don't lik chewing my noodles The swirl ones? Narutomaki It's fish cake Me @DaHomieDrew  today is the death anniversary of my childhood dog I'm going to the garden to lay down some flowers for her.

ah i interpreted "rolling out vip" as giving it to EVERYONE for free, i misunderstood itg. yeah but id rather have less than 200 and have it full of inactives makes us more susceptible to raids and spam and whatnot they'll be fair im tired of rules being too subjective from mod to mod. these new set of rules will give solid examples so that it isn't up to the mod's opinion or pov. if it infringes the rules, you get punished. if it doesn't, then no punishment will be enacted. fghuio HP THATS THE LAST PING I PROMISE noooo sxcdfgh it's self-assignable he has to assign it to himself yes but :pleb: i am good admin AND I OOP @Water Puppies  yes, hot pocket?

I mean I'm half Chinese but I fukin hate China so China sucks ass The government at least Most of my relatives are in Hong Kong because they fled from the communists Mhm Sad 小熊维尼 小熊维尼 小熊维尼 When I play with a Chinese person online and he's being annoying I just spam 小熊维尼 And they get BANNED It's Winnie the Pooh in Chinese Lmao They've banned Winnie the Pooh @вера  YES @DaHomieDrew  because the president looks like Winnie the Pooh I'm not fucking joking Pooh's Chinese name (Chinese: 小熊维尼; lit.: 'little bear Winnie') has been censored from video games such as World of Warcraft, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Arena of Valor,[59] and Devotion.[60] Images of Pooh in Kingdom Hearts III were also blurred out.[61]
Despite the ban, two Winnie the Pooh-themed rides appear in Disneyland Shanghai.[62] When someone pisses me off on PubG I just sing the Winnie the Pooh theme song in Mandarin Then he gets booted from the game Lmao Btw @MaralinaSakura I have question about the UK Do ppl actually like/care about the royal family My friend from the UK hates them so much and he's glad (one of them??) Left?? Is it true ppl hate Meghan cause she's POC That's what my friend says at least 🤷‍♀️ Oh My friend hates Americans So makes sense Mhm I wish we had royalty I wish I WAS the royalty ;) Lmao Well I mean china had emperors n shit But idk if I'm related to any YOOOO THERE WAS AN EMPEROR WITH MY FAMILY NAME score I'm Empress now https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor Yes I am aware that the title is racist But my last name literally means YELLOW Lmao no my name translates to yellow 黄 So my name is Viv Yellow I am aware it can be used as a slur but like what can I do Also lmao 🤣 TIL Disney was racist as fuck towards asians https://youtu.be/ZFI52R5GRWY Dunno why this is the title it's not funny But WHY IS HE PLAYING WITH CHOPSTICKS Also @Strife  iirc they made fun of Thai people in an old Disney movie https://decider.com/2019/11/12/lady-and-the-tramp-siamese-cat-song-remake/ The “Siamese Cat Song” is a racist caricature of what white people thought of Asian people at the time. Their names are racist (“Si” and “Am”), their design is racist (those teeth), their voices are racist (that broken English and accent), and the music is racist (that gong). Their role in the plot is also racist: these Asian absolutely trash Lady’s home, and frame her for the whole thing. They’re outright villains. Lmao I remember watching it as a kid and I was like wow what the fuck @Strife Usually Asian jokes are used with Siamese cats Disney was HELLA racist I think the most racist ones were directed at African Americans and Native Americans Because OOF have u seen Peter pan @Strife wasup Oh my mom is asleep next to me But we can dm Man Also Disney screwed over a relative of mine Like he did majority of the work for one of the films and he did not receive credit He only got recognized in the 2010s iirc Yeah Look him up, his name is Tyrus Wong. He was a brilliant man So now you know why Bambi's background art looks like Chinese paintings Bc it rly is Chinese paintings He died on New Year's Eve. I was so sad :-( True He was a great man He spent retirement making kites One of the kites Ah Did u not see the racist native American song That shit was so hard to watch https://youtu.be/f7yE8TKUB_M Nah it was straight up racist I watched it again and I was like 👁️👄👁️ Yeah it rly is I can't even sit through the entire thing I cringe too hard @вера  more racist way (skin color) I saw it when I was 5 or something Yeahhh It's real bad I didn't notice the racism as a kid (except for the Siamese ones) My dad taught me at a very young age that if someone makes fun of you by exaggerating your features or making fun of your language, you punch them in the throat. Same here Asia is kinda Oof Woooo New icon Did they announce August books O I wanna know Any ideas for which book is coming in August RAAAAA Let TRR die in peace They're dragging its corpse around It would've been nice if it ended with TRR The end Like I rly would've remembered the characters fondly Now I hate them Lmao Maybe a TRR spin-off Like with brand new characters Truly where is my zombie book Where the fUck I want a noir detective book Or a murder dinner party book @egg  isn't that TCATF Dragons, war and sex lol Ahh Gotcha Political period drama Ooo Which ones Hdjebhdkdhd My dad is watching one on Netflix rn I don't pay attention but I get bits and pieces of dialogue Lmao We are very cutthroat God I forgot all of my Chinese history after I graduated high school I used to memorize all the dynasties and shit We even had to draw the map of China from scratch I cheated of course How the fuck would I remember every part of China Wahh right So you went to a Chinese school? O My sister went to college in SCAD HK I went to some Chinese school back here So are you still in HK Ooo I love Hong Kong I've got family there Oooh best of luck What if we're family o w o Got any family with the name 黄 or 马?? Well that's a lot of people It's pretty common Mine too :WTFthonk: Bruh Texted my dad Lmao Actually I met a 黄 in college that turned out to be my cousin But we aren't Hong Kong natives We come from Guangdong Taishan Mmm O I did this Chinese DNA test thingy and we are mostly Southern Han Chinese O My dad's side is the Chinese one I was mostly raised Chinese bc I was sent to a Chinese school and I had clan dinners every weekend Ohoho I thought I was 50-50 Chinese Filipino but apparently my dad isn't even pure Chinese Wack My dad had a Vietnamese grandma or great grandma Uhh he also had Mongol heritage My mom's was even more wack We have no fucking idea how Native American and Bengali got in there but it's still cool Hello  @Andromeda !!!

Most of us are minorities OH Where were they even from American squad? That's a very weird statement this server is mostly minorities. POC, LGBT, and more. Weird I think it wouldn't hurt to include male and nb MCs Many choices fans are actually gender nonconforming Right? Except for that 1 token character they have so they can say they're inclusive Truly I wanted choices to include pronouns Aisha is MTF right I didn't play the book I wouldn't mind having an NB LI but Facebook moms would be angry I remember Facebook moms were hella fucking racist because they used a black female LI to market NB And they were like WHY IS SHE WOMAN WHY ISNT SHE BLONDE WOMAN A :mmNo: Yes yes yes Just like how || racists and neo Nazis || were fans of Rick and Morty so they made it a point to make fun of them and beat them up on the show RPDR COLLAB YAS What They added lea Michele Lmao That didn't age well I'll tell u that Hey @Deleted User Lea Michele is a shithead Nah dude She racist as hell And she bullied the poc actors on Glee She a shithead https://i.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/entertainment-top-stories/121744305/lea-micheles-apology-backfires-more-actors-accuse-her-of-bullying She's an asshole Huh I sent an article Lea is horrible I wouldn't even fuck especially after she told a black actress she would take a shit in her wig That's just no > If u think about it, she plays the role of a neurotic bitch too well😂

It was so good, they both stayed in the competition. It was an elimination round. Omg priy It's LEGENDARY I remember watching this live and screaming https://www.facebook.com/2307038339618652/videos/512889762579375/?extid=cGCNKvPlxjJieCC6 @Deleted User YoURE WELcome I died It slays me every time RIGHT they only do that to the very best RIGHT ugh I watch that video once a week and i just crie every time We NEED an Indian queen on the show I swear, I'd love to see the fabulous looks they'd turn out 🥺 No the two queens you saw were not trans! Drag queens are basically men (usually gay men) who dress like women and perform on stage These are the 2 you saw out of drag But yes! There are trans people who do drag. Usually MTF. RuPaul made drag mainstream in Hollywood so he has a show now where other drag queens compete. And if you ask how they hide their You Know What, oh boy... you're gonna have to brace yourself. @Deleted User Yep! But drag queen = a man who dresses and performs as a woman professionally Drag race is so fucking chaotic, so many memes too Are they cis men irl MMM I guess but traditionally, drag queens perform at night clubs and stuff! There are more drag queens on tv but that's a new thing considering how Hollywood was (and still is) homophobic Drag race is so fucking chaotic https://youtu.be/XlQpM7JRoHQ Tag urself staff edition Trinity talking seriously is @kyo running the server 

Shea kack-kack-powing on the floor is Viv and her knowledge of discord 

Valentina screaming while Trinity removes her boob tape is @red hot silly pepper 

Two queens cringing in the background are @Weiss & @Strife > In India, we used to have *Ram leela* which is basically like a skit on Ramayana every year during dussera. There, men used to act as women bc it was inapropriate for women to act in those skits

> Victoria 

I clearly have a type MHmm Ah fuck Forgot to play new QB Is it any good Wait hol up Need a question answered on #queen-b Bruh I'm so heated #choices-chat But yeah @DaHomieDrew as I was saying, I feel like East/Southeast Asians are pretty "lucky" compared to folks with darker skin. White people don't see Asians as a threat and yes, although we experience racism every day, I don't think it compares to that of African Americans and Latinx > Well, Asia is usually praised a lot for its work and production, plus they are famed a lot for beauty :nicothinking:
@MaralinaSakura I hate that this is the case because it crosses over to fetishization It's gross U see teenage white girls calling grown ass Asian men their "uwu baby senpai" it's fuckin wack And Asian women are ...a whole ass tag on p&rnhub I feel like it's extra extra weird with asians. Especially since we are portrayed as submissive, baby-like, cute, harmless Like bruh I'm 23 I'm not ur baby Exactly I haven't worn a school uniform in like 5 years Jesus God I hate it I know shit tons of asians that go to jail for murder tell him to talk to them :WTFthonk: ALSO I have a bone to pick with East asians Especially with their treatment of Southeast/South Asians > ALSO I have a bone to pick with East asians
 me as the spiderman meme Idk man I feel like people lift up East asians (Chinese, japanese, Korean) And they shit on the darker skinned asians (Vietnamese, Filipino, Malaysian, etc) Zzz maybe if u didn't wreck our country we would be just as successful @westerners > because they have a rep for being technologically and socially advanced while the rest of them "have some catching up to do"
@DaHomieDrew I was 5 months ago years old when I found out I have Vietnamese roots Im half East Asian, half southeast Asian but I have a darker(??) Complexion Id say I'm in the middle of yellow and brown Meh I just know I'm too light to be accepted by Filipinos and too dark to be accepted by the Chinese Truly Gotta be pale, skinny, pointy nose, have white people eyelids God, do they ever do that thing where they make a game out of guessing what "kind of Asian" you are I fuckin hate that Also hate how whenever I ask someone for directions they try to converse with me in broken Chinese like

"My brother is dating an Asian haha Nihao that means hi" > as someone who went to a majority white elementary school, i've only ever been pointed at by obnoxious Caucasian kids claiming that im Chinese. its gotten to the point where i got tired of correcting them
@DaHomieDrew hfkdhfkdhdkd THEY THINK THEY KNOW BETTER THAN U I am Chinese but I don't wanna speak to them in Chinese tf They're so amused by asians speaking native tongues but they hate it when Latinx people speak Spanish Where is the logic in that Oh lawd yeah Foreign guest comes into my house, points at my Yorkie and asks if it's my pet or dinner > so that makes me a math genius?
@DaHomieDrew I'm dyslexic to numbers RIght Like NO THATS NOT MY DINNER THATS MY BABY TF Wahh thank you 😭 I'm super pale because I have unfortunately caught the virus > What the heck is I and A
@MaralinaSakura intersex... A(?) We should just call them R A I N B O W So like nobody gets left out I'm the B in LGBT I'm fine w being called rainbow Like tf I love rainbows Can we just be called "cuter than u lmao" I'd be ok w that Cuter than u it is Hi I'm Viv and I will take you AND your man God I will never forget my Chinese father's reaction to me coming out V: "Dad, I'm bi."

Dad: "So you like da diik and poosy??!?"

V: "yes"

Dad: "oh ok" Lgdkdhkebd Also me, my mom and my sister came out on the same day My sister and I are bi, we told our dad together Then my dad was like "oh wow u like diik and poosy is that a real thing" And my mom was like "yeah I had a gf in high school" And we were like 👁️ 👄 👁️ Oh yeah I have hella gay relatives My uncle is a beautician! He actually does my ABG ombre hair for real cheap *Shows dad picture of my female crush on IG*

Me: Look dad, isn't she so pretty 

Dad:

*dad double taps the screen and walks away while I frantically try to undo it* My dad's a fucking weirdo > ~~viv's bf: wha abt me 👁️ 👄 👁️~~
@red hot silly pepper DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME HE "SNITCHED" ON ME He thought I was having an affair.... I'm I wasn't but he was rly ready to rat me out I'm OH Cause my bf and I are friends with this 1 guy He's handsome and stuff but we're really just friends and my bf absolutely loves him I brought that friend to my house to play video games and then my dad pulled me aside and said "I'm telling your boyfriend.

Rusty was a huge part of your life He knew he had given you the support you needed all those years and now it's time for him to rest 💖 My dog stayed with me throughout my childhood. I was 10 and she died when I was 22. I didn't have a lot of friends growing up so she was my best friend. In college, I came out of my shell and made lots of friends. I think that's when my dog realized that it was ok, I was in good hands and she could go. Gah Fever yet again Ily @DaHomieDrew Oh god Merry Christmas @bluebird  HI BIRD WELCOME Do you know you can use the mod? Saved me a ton of money Also MERRY CHRISTMAS @ ALL MY FILIPINOS !!! JOSE MARI CHAN HAS EMERGED FROM HIS CAVE @MaralinaSakura  Jose Mari Chan is our Michael Buble He is only relevant for Xmas > Nah they actually celebrate Christmas in the Philippines in September it's fine @Deleted User
@oge YES SEPTEMBER TO FEBRUARY > Christmas goes on for months?

@MaralinaSakura  I know right I quit life Hiiii Can i ask for some advice @CoolCCMystery  uhh family advice?? Cousin advice What @Deleted User Sorry ok here it is As you may know I've been sick for a month Oh no it's ok I can post it here Anyway yeah I've been sick and while I've been sick, my aunt passed away. She was a single mom with a grown up son Her son (my cousin) is blowing up my fukn phone asking me for money But 
1. I just started at my job and I don't have money
2. I paid upwards of 500usd on the memorial service 3. You're 30 and I just graduated college So like... Was I an asshole for saying no > Why
@Deleted User wym Oh because he has none, he spends it all on vaping and buying electronics. BUT his mom just died so I feel bad :hawyee: But idk he made me feel like shit after And get this, I found out my mom had sent him money days before he asked me. That means he spent all that in a couple of days. :( I guess Idk my aunt would've wanted her son to be caref for I mean I'll make sure he doesn't starve of course but Jesus he's 30 and asking a 20 something year old for money > How can you help him when you think you can barley afford to help yourself rn?
@mango.exe that's the tea periodt Thanks bb @mango.exe Oh @Deleted User @Deleted User I have a dumb question I have a Bangladeshi team mate on pubg, does he speak the same language as you guys? I know they have their own language but do Indians understand them and vice versa? Oh Ohhh Makes sense, they're a different country I have some south Asian in me I know English, Filipino, Mandarin and Taishanese But like I don't really speak Chinese well > Oh. There's several versions of English though, British, American, Canadian and Australian etc not to mention different dialects in each
@Deleted User my country was an American colony for a while so yeah we're taught American English @Strife  was Thailand ever colonized? I never studied any other history besides Chinese history and Filipino history Idk man the Philippines is a damsel in need of rescuing And America is their knight in shining armor Rather, gun enthusiast in American flag and eagle patterned shirts God I wish we didn’t have to rely so much on the US :mmNo: I guess spelling differs with UK vs US Talong 🍆 Y'all ever wonder why Disney casts British people to play villains Yeah But why is British associated with evil :WTFthonk: Scar is British and his brother Mufasa is American :WTFthonk: Loki is British > Thailand villan are US or British or some nation near by
@Strife lmao filipino villains are other Filipinos who fuck their husbands Literally every filipino movie is a love triangle drama T r a s h I do like some filipino movies but only the Indie films @lavacookie90#4268 yes Oop Did she yeet @Deleted User yes Ah there it works He is voiced by Jeremy Irons Wha Nah he did a substantial amount He just had a voice double when he got sick or something Actually Jim Cummings only subbed for Jeremy Irons in the song Be Prepared Everything else was Jeremy Irons It's Michael isn't it Not Micheal That would be pronounced Mai-keel Did trump just ask his supporters to commit fraud :WTFthonk: :mmNo: He deadass told his supporters in North Carolina to vote twice which is a felony He's basically telling them to do what he's accusing the Democrats of doing :WTFthonk: I'm confused as to why this guy is still in power because he's clearly incompetent but then again, the Philippines has the same problem. @MaralinaSakura u there I added you as a friend !!

Welcome @𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙚𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠 Glad to have you here Just a reminder that we don’t discuss drama nor talk badly about other servers on my server! Yep 👍 Spoiler Land 2 and my server aren’t run by the same people, we thought we’d just give them a shoutout since many people like spoilers here. Thanks maraaa Still gotta get my vit D levels up :hawyee: I’m at 25 but it’s supposed to be 50 Thank you! Love your pfp, that kitten is cute! Thanks, I just found it actually 🤣 I can't draw to save my lifeee Thank u @Raven  💖💖 I thought I wouldn't survive back there Did you remove your pfp or is my discord being weird Oof That's happened to me Never used to be an issue That's odd Hmm should I change my pfp I'm super fickle Idk how people can keep the same one for years Oh my nicknames been the same for a while @MaralinaSakura omg I thought you'd use Umi or something I saw really cute fanart of Umi Act on what @MaralinaSakura  my sister's an artist and she said usually artists only care if you use their drawings for brand stuff or to make money off of it. They usually don't mind w pfps. @Deleted User what do you mean exactly Sorry, didn't understand your phrasing > Oh, really?? I know that you should always ask Japanese artists because they could get DMCAs or legal trouble because of copyright
@MaralinaSakura really?? Usually when I make it my pfp I credit them or give them a follow. Then again, idk if I've used any japanese artists. @Deleted User  yeah, I don't think anyone likes drama! I think as long as everyone follows the rules, they'll be fine. @MaralinaSakura these r my faves First one is from Pixiv by a Chinese artist iirc Chinese people are masters of bootleg and pirating shit so brksjdhdjd Uhh yeah, I think so! General is fine @Deleted User @MaralinaSakura second one I believe is by an artist named YukiSakura No, I play Choices exclusively. Mainly because I have the mod. O I need to catch up on OH Did they make up for what they did @Raven did you see that Latino parents tiktok I sent Oooo God I hate pb I miss bolas And it lives 🥺 I've been hoping for a horror book this October Did that to my mom once with Only by Nicki Minaj, I think my mom's eyes grew 20% bigger @Sceptik welcome!! Hi 2d I'm doing ok @Andromeda I'm recovered!! Hi @alisSa ! Welcome Get some #roles :romance: Hi ho My boyfriend just sent me this I'm Oh I didn't know you were transitioning! I wish you the best of luck @Brohepsi For what it's worth, my friend who is transitioning had his eggs frozen in case he wanted kids in the future. Did u know people have surgery to remove their ribs for cosmetic purposes Saw a documentary on a human barbie who wanted to look like barbie so she removed her last two ribs So he could woohoo his own hoo-ha Holy fuck British jin scares me Also he had surgery to slant his eyes and that's racist as fuck https://youtu.be/f_MgAeIkGTQ Noah fence but people like him are the reason why I have an aversion to Kpop I feel like a lot of the fans are creepy and have 0 boundaries And fetishize these grown ass men As an East Asian, I rly find those crazy stans creepy. It's like they use Korean culture as an aesthetic and they dehumanize these idols by infantilizing them. But that's just me Like no, he's not your baby boy or whatever, he's a man in his 20s. I hate that they're reducing these talented singers/dancers to baby boy uwu > It's the same with Asian women and ||porn||
@Brohepsi truly Like I'm fine with Kpop, not my cup of tea but I won't deny their talent. It's just the weird fan girls that really put me off. I see white women speaking broken Korean on twitter and it's just :LMFAOdead: True Fan girls/boys who claim ownership over these idols are the creepiest for real I don't like how girls are portrayed in anime in general Passive, annoying, needy Glad anime is starting to show realistic women Gskshdkebd Boing boing Anime is starting to make fun of that tho I like that they're making girls more goofy and funny in modern anime I think @BigHutchHO would like this anime https://youtu.be/3tQPjBZ7-P8 Reminds me of the kind of humor he likes I have a female friend in japan Most women in japan are pretty bashful and sweet Oh god 😂 I love that anime it's so fucking stupid @BigHutchHO and his friend Olivia, probably. 

https://youtu.be/JR2rgQ_lPxo Asobi asobase changed my life > Why are they spanking her

Very gentle and quiet and affectionate. We have no idea what happened but I feel like this is a ruse. If my house catches on fire and my family goes missing, you'll know it's Kyo the dog. Today he walked up to me and politely asked to be petted (he didn't even shatter my eardrums) What a weird dog Too good :mmNo: I see right through him Robert Pattinson has covid Oof His kids are young Ree Why did they have people over Here's hoping they're mild cases Covid sucks ass Hmm Thinking of more pitches for pb 50 shades but instead of BDSM it's Christian gray treating his secretary nicely in exchange for fair compensation Yes Oh @Purplesim  :( @Purplesim  you still in Mindanao?

Ooh that's great 😊 those lines are very pronounced, they're gonna be with you for a very long time. Oh wow your ring finger is pretty long, usually indicates courage, passion and friendship.

My friends who graduated with a BA in english are teachers now Their kids keep doing Tik Tok dances Ooh Hmm, I have another friend who works for a magazine. Yeaa You could be an ESL tutor Ohh you'd need extra years to complete that right My cousin graduated with hotel restaurant management Major in culinary arts She used to be the most sensitive person ever but holy fuck her profs were meaner than Gordon Ramsay and now she has balls of steel Ugh I can't imagine being in customer service I would probably go to jail for whooping a Karen's ass Mandarin Jk don't It's a trap Yeah I'd lose my patience for sure Plus so many people are entitled as fuck and I can't imagine having to eat their ass for a paycheck True You could pick up a minor to supplement your English degree Ooh My boyfriend is in law school I keep asking him how it is but he just keeps sending this photo in response So uh Is it hard in the US In the Philippines, the entrance exams are easy and you get in as long as you pass. Staying in however is a different story 20% of the class drops out in the first week :LMFAOdead: Kind of a smart tactic tbh, they collect your enrollment money and then they yeet you into the sun. I'm gonna be a child psychologist!! I think that would be fun Love working w kids > But the odds of getting into that are slim to none

@DaHomieDrew ooo I see that Hmm always thought Priy would be telekinesis Or tech powers (??) Like the power to make tech work at her will or explode She always gave me that vibe Right? You could charge a phone or hack a computer Or make a machine burst into flames I'm pmsing so it's gonna rain y'all better evacuate the house Vdkdbd For drew I thought either invisibility or the ability to change his body's matter(??) Like he could be rock or water or slime I'd love to be jello Idk what kinda power would I have Based on your impressions of me Kyo would have telekenisis Like eleven Like Eleven's powers I could see Kyo as a dimension hopper Which element would I control I can see Kyo dimension hopping Rae probably healing or talking to the dead > what would i do tho
@kyo hop to dimensions where you can explore new worlds and open portals for ppl You can go anywhere!! That would be really cool Or I could see you as a Time traveler Or a time freezer Mhm Yeah you could come back with new gadgets or new powers or whatever Just limitless possibilities Bread defo would be charm speak or healing @Strife I haven't seen u in a while Wonder how he is Boss would be a mind reader or a human encyclopedia Anhiro would talk to animals I could see Altair with a wolfs curse sort of thing Empath? Ok hero name time If I did the weather thing maybe vortex or sunspot or something corny like that > Mr. Transparent maybe because invisibility. Idk, I’m not creative with names 🙃
@DaHomieDrew shroud?? Like shrouded Priy would be sth cute like Gadget owo For @oge I think he'd be able to erase powers temporarily like that dude from bnha Mara would probably have queen powers Like she could make anyone obey her Some Simon says shit Oo I haven't seen that one But my bf looks like the Asian dude Right rae @Deleted User aaaaa So cute Hmm idk if I'd have a supersuit Drew would def need one since he's invisible Omg Did u see that gif with Nick fury https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/c9vwwi/infinity_war_and_incredibles_side_by_side/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share How does wonderwoman fight without getting a wedgie How do people make those emotes Hi can I get opinions I know a small time IG influencer who refuses to give her child her own bedroom She lives in a swanky 2 bedroom apartment and the extra room that is meant to be for her baby has been turned into her... Instagram room. Yes Hence I am asking here The child is my niece I have Still refuses to give her child a room Yeah was gonna ask if I should ask my relatives Or if it's overstepping I'm in the Philippines But eh CPS here is shit So was wondering if I should tell on her Bc I'm rly close w her dad But idk if it's "bad" enough or if I'd be overreacting So she's 1 And she doesn't have a bedroom with a crib Her crib is in the living room and her play pen is in the kitchen That's fucked right Or is that kinda weird but not so fucked up Yep since she was born Her "Instagram room" is literally a white room filled with props and a tripod w/ some lights She asked me if it was fucked to do that for her kid until she's 10 and I'm like... Yes??? But she says "nah it'll be fine, if I give her the room that'll be the death of my Instagram" WHY did you have a baby No it isn't She has a full-time job as a female executive and she's paid well Instagram is her hobby She even pays 10k php a month to promote her page That's 200usd So annoying that she doesn't understand how a child's brain works and yet she had a child anyway 👁️👄👁️ Also she makes her kid hella hungry because she takes extra long to prepare her _æsthetic_ baby food She has lots of children's books but she uses them to pose with her kid and pretends that she's reading to her but she rly isn't it's just for pics Like to me, it's p fucked up but idk if it's fucked up by other people's standards y'know? Enough to tell on her and risk our  relationship I'd do it for the kid but if her grandparents think I'm overreacting it'll just be awkward Mmm fair OH did I mention she was late to the birth of her child because she was doing her makeup Where'd you sleep Oh what Priy isn't an only child I never had my own room but I had one with my sister which was good enough But yeah idk if there's anything I can do and I'm just horrified as I watch her "raise" the kid O Wait so Her mom deadass was 30 minutes late To her birth I'm dead She was set to give birth via C section at 10am She was late bc she was doing her makeup and arrived to the operating room late bruh Mhm It's fucked She has a real job that pays well She's just an influencer in her free time I am gonna feel so bad for this kid Her mom was gonna adopt believe it or not, but she turned the kid down for being too || dark skinned || :mmNo: She an asshole Also @Deleted User do u only have 1 brother Wha OH yeah She has said that Why would anyone hate priy Ugh I'm so tempted to buy VIP BC I wanna binge books I hate waiting for keys Ah I gave up on drawing bc it's not neurologically possible for me Oh I have a condition in my brain that makes it hard to Aw it's ok, I've had it since birth so it's no biggie https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyscalculia I'm going to the emergency room Oh hiii welcome @Deleted User Favorite book and Li? emergency room so crowded Ree Good thing I'm supposedly immune for 3 months Viet friends what’s a Dua a??

When my grandma died, I cried all day until I was exhausted and passed out. Suddenly I had a "dream?" I was flying out of my recliner (where I was napping) and then into the clouds. I heard this really old song playing and it sounded like it was playing on a really old radio or something. The clouds were pink, like pastel pink and I looked down to see my grandma but maybe 20 years younger. She was walking towards a man in a military uniform, he looked about 40 or 50. She was in a black dress with vibrant flowery print, it was really beautiful. They started to dance to the song, the man was pretty awkward and uncoordinated but they were having fun. I called out to grandma but she couldn't see me, it was just her and that man dancing. she was laughing so hard, I've never seen her so happy before. The song kept playing, I had no idea what the song was but they kept repeating the lyrics "at last...at last" Then suddenly I woke up and there were tears in my eyes but...happy tears?? I quickly googled the lyrics at this song came up https://open.spotify.com/track/4Hhv2vrOTy89HFRcjU3QOx?si=zfYRi2bnRzOXcSvwuly7aA I read the lyrics and I started fucking sobbing because I realized the man was my grandpa that I never got to meet (he died in his 50s) and I went to albums to look at his face and he looked exactly like he did in my "dream" He died around 3 decades ago and my grandma never moved on. she talked to him constantly while he was alive. And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh, yeah, yeah, and you smile, you smile
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last ^anyway yeah those were the lyrics to the song And idk if it was a dream or my mind cooked it up but I felt like my grandma was telling me she's happy now The end Sorry this was long No He was a soldier Anyway forgot this part of the story but remember the floral dress I mentioned? I ran into her room and guess what I saw sitting in her bed? Yeah I've never seen this dress before But it was there Yeah @DaHomieDrew my story up there if u wanna read ^^ SIMBA

Forcing yourself to have a family when you clearly don't want one is only gonna be harmful for you and your family. Mood Truly. As a Chinese woman, I'm expected to bear sons. It sucks. Don't get me wrong, I would love kids of my own. I just hate being asked about when I'm having them at every family gathering. Mood GDIDHFKDJR Mood Dude it's like flipping a switch

Best case scenario you have ADHD and now you are equipped with the knowledge to help See a psychiatrist online Ask for a zoom meeting with one for consultation They should have one if you call up a hospital and ask for the number of a psychiatrist who does online meetings Yes but they will help It's like a regular doctors visit If it's to help you academically I think they'd definitely want to give it a shot I went from summer school in high school to deans Lister in university so it's worth a shot Aren't you about to finish college I think it's worth a try to see a psychiatrist first before you decide https://www.columbiaasia.com/indonesia/specialties/psychiatry

Thank you, next (next) Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, "Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know

I haven't seen that yet, it's on my watch list https://www.idrlabs.com/anger/test.php Take this test bitches Let's see who can beat Viv Heyyyyy Hostile outlook is the highest Hostile Outlook
People who score high on hostile outlook view the world in a cynical, suspicious and mistrustful way. They have an easy time attributing ill intentions to others, and often assume that others are lying or do not have their best interests at heart. People who are characterized by a hostile outlook usually experience a wide range of anger cognitions, but not necessarily anger emotions.

Anger arousal denotes the frequency, magnitude and duration of a person’s angry responses. People who score high on anger arousal are quick to escalate from their normal state to the state of anger. Their anger usually has an affective charge, and they may experience their own anger and the bodily sensations that accompany it as overwhelming.

Those that live in the last two are termed nunò sa punsó (Tagalog for “old man of the mound”). They are either categorized as good or evil depending on their color (white or black, respectively), and are often said to play with children (who are more capable than adults of seeing them). Offending a nunò sa punsó is taboo; people who step on them are believed to be cursed by the angered dwende within. Have any Viet ones? Oooo Owl 🦉 Yeah I've been cursed We cut down trees at home once and I've gotten unexplained fever or flu My grandma said she'd see me playing with an invisible child lmao I was like :catWTF: We do this too My mom's strict about it Hdkddkd do u not have superstitions I believe in it Nsjdjdkd DONT WANT THEM FOLLOWING YOU HOME But also in a mental health sense, it's nice to go somewhere else before going home Sort of like to drop the negative energy somewhere do u guys find that creepy I thought it was reasonable Lol Chinese ones r cool too We do lots of Chinese ones Long noodles
Chinese superstition doesn’t stop at the dinner table either. Ever eaten Chinese noodle and noticed every piece is as long as your arm? That is because the popular belief uncut noodles in soup will increase longevity. If noodles are cut it will ‘cut the longevity’. ^ we serve noodles on birthdays Unlucky 4’s
On the flip side of Chinese superstition, the number four is considered to be unlucky and the number is avoided for vehicles and houses. The reason is that the number four in Chinese has the pronunciation that is similar to the word for ‘death’. My aunt gets SO HEATED when we get hotel rooms with 4s, sometimes hotels in Asia skip the hotel floor all together She also gets mad at 4s on license plates Didnt I tell yall she CHOSE THE DATE MY COUSIN WAS GIVING BIRTH IN a lucky date She's probably gonna kill me when she finds out I'm getting married in July She had my cousin induced OH NO IN 2025 I want it to be around our dating anniversary So we don't have to celebrate twice That shit annoying O god Do u want her to strangle me Fun fact My cousin was late to her child's birth Because she was doing her makeup :--) She sat in the bathroom doing her eyebrows Yep Probably the vainest woman I've met Her child doesn't have her own room BECAUSE GET THIS THE OTHER BEDROOM IS FOR INSTAGRAM :pogfish: The fuckin photoshoot room She also misses all her kid's major milestones bc she's too busy making them wear matching outfits to pose for the gram It's very sad Yea She pays for sponsored posts Imagine making your one year old do this shit Instead of idk playing and watching Disney films Hate clout chaser moms Like your kid isn't an accessory Exactly Tbh family influencers r weird to me Kids can't consent to being on vlogs Six months to one year old is crucial in the developmental stage of a baby In terms of speech and motor skills Oh That's great Forcing kids into vlogs sucks Yea and there are || sickos || out there I don't think so I mean these people make it their livelihood The kids are their actual livelihood Right? It's child labor Lots of people even post their kids meltdowns And personal probsb I think it's ok to have a private Insta or post your kids on Facebook Like for family But to actually monetize your baby is gross Yeah we meant like Making money Hfkdhdjej Making money off your child is gross Which is what my cousin is doing REMEMBER THAT FAM WHO ADOPTED FROM CHINA AND THEN GAVE THE KID BACK Dhkdhr Disgosten She called it Re-homing https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/myka-stauffer-adoption-huxley-youtuber-says-she-placed-son-with-autism-with-other-family/ When the baby wasn't a baby anymore they gave him away "re homing is for a fuckin dog not a human" They got hella money and clout from adopting a special needs baby from China Imagine adopting from China and giving him a fucking name like HUXLEY Retweet HUXLEY THATS A CRIME "He's done enough for the Stauffers. He bought them a McMansion, multiple vacations a year, etc. What did he get in exchange? He got re-homed as if her [sic] were a freaking puppy!" the petition said Right They bought hella shit w the Huxley clout Apparently they'd give Huxley a separate room and they'd all lock him upstairs while the parents and biological kids had "family time" Wouldn't allow him to hang with the other biological kids too It's messed up Adoption is sacred imo It's accepting someone who isn't in your bloodline into your family and it requires a lot of trust and a lot of love Yeah for everyone but mostly the baby The thing is they're still uploading She has over 600k too And a new infant that she made herself Yeah they uploaded still after that rehome announcement Is the ace family still up Hiss They make the kids participate in fabricated plotlines n shit for clout My fam is applying to be a foster home 🙏 hoping we can give a little infant some love and a semblance of a family before she's adopted We'd rather she live here than in a crowded orphanage with a diaper rash and bronchitis We'll teach her to walk and talk and send her to preschool until her papers are ready for her to fly abroad to meet her forever fam Thank you 🥺 It's gonna break our hearts when she leaves but it's gonna be worth it Lots of kids in orphanages suffer from developmental and social delays because theres a 10:1 kid to caretaker ratio So hopefully we can take care of 1 It's not a huuuge accomplishment imo since it's just one child but we want her to have all the attention Same I'm fine with || surrogates if the mom and dad have viable eggs and sperm but the mom has health problems || Like Kim and Kanye Some people can't wrap their heads around || caring for someone else's baby || In the Philippines, they choose babies that look like their parents so that they can adjust well. So if you've got curly hair or dark skin or brown eyes, they take that all into account. This is for local adoptions only ofc. Also you can't pick the child Cherrypicking children like puppies isn't allowed in the Philippines, you get matched by the social worker.

Steakhouse time :tanukiDrums: Yes it's time My stomach is killing me 😫 What did u forget Oh god How long did u have Oh no where did Kyo go Is it sleepy time in the west coast I honestly love both dub and sub cast. I actually got an autograph from Aleks Le !! I'm a huge Demon Slayer fan dhkdbfjd I mean ofc nobody can do it like the original japanese cast but I can appreciate the dub like its own entity. Plus, I'd watch it in both sub & dub anyway. And it's not like they got some random people off the street to do dub, Zach Aguilar and Abby Trott did work for Fire Emblem and Bryce Papenbrook is a veteran in the industry. ok that's it thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Where is Kyo REEEEE We had a scheduled appointment :catHideThePain: What u doing rn drew O shit He an independent boi My dog refused my cuddles today so I'm gonna mope around the house https://tenor.com/view/captain-holt-brooklyn-nine-99-how-dare-you-gif-12239747 I do like both. The original japanese version is great as well. Same thoughts. I got Aleks Le's autograph with a small Zenitsu print Yeah I hate when they try to westernize the original material But afaik they don't do that anymore I like that the dub even calls them Hashira instead of pillar :smiledoge: But yes the dub cast gets so much shit for no reason, usually when a gatekeeping weeb asks you sub or dub, you get shat on for saying dub. Like dub makes you less of a fan Hdkdhfjd Plus the most sacred dub of all, Ghost Stories. Like I've actually been to Japan and Akiba, dickhead. You're not a bigger degenerate weeb than me!!!!!

That shit is amazing Disney wishes they could achieve that level of ride tech True Spiderman is my fave And its decades old!!! I believe older than me Disney could NEVER But I def prefer Disney bc their level of guest services and polish is chefs kiss Like you can NEVER see trash on the floor because someone is there to pick it up Disney food is good but so expensive It's like 14 dollars for a turkey leg Ohmygod Universal staffers r also rude as fuck My cardiologist told me I was ok on any rides as long as they didn't have drops so I asked someone on Harry Potter if their rides had one and he said "What do you think" LIKE I DONT KNOW THATS WHY IM ASKING :catWTF: Anyway yeah I guess they're just underpaid and tired from working in the Florida heat But c'mon man I have a heart murmur I also got hit on by the train conductor at Hogwarts express But like :DancingCockroach: Disney has 3 parks in Asia I believe Japan, Shanghai and HK I don't think they'll expand any further bc they have too many parks in Asia Japan and Singapore!

IT LIVES BENEATH drew which dream did i tell u about cvghj ive had so many of those || stabby || ones oof yeah that happens :/ mustve been so upsetting i have ptsd so my sister says i scream in my sleep and then i laughed bc it reminded me of pimento in b99 ohhh by the fan? oh well i did have a dream that i was a hollywood actress and  there was a girl from the czech republic who claimed to be my biggest fan. she got extensive surgery to look exactly like me, even hired a vocal coach to get her voice exactly the same as mine. anyway in my dream, she came to my mansion in LA and she introduced herself, we were wearing the exact same thing and i was kinda creeped out so i was gonna close the door but she stopped it with her foot. she went "wait, can i be you? i can be your double and i'll attend all the events and movie premieres while you rest at home." and obv i was like NO wtf get out of my house and then she pulled out a || knife || and chased me round the house. my dad called 911 because we ended up locked in a room together and i was wrestling the || knife || out of her hands. the police got the door open and i was holding the knife, this bitch changes her tune and starts bawling claiming I WAS the stalker, not her. everyone believed her i was in disbelief. anyway i went to jail and i looked back at my house from the cop car and she was at the window creepily waving at me. THE END My mom was trying to read the tag on our air freshener and ended up spraying herself in the face Like mother, like daughter:lovechick: How do I get my boyfriend to stop saying Real Hot Girl Shit whenever he does literally anything :catWTF: Gdiehrehdjd it's Meg Thee Stallion's catchphrase Books where they have male MC options: 

Blades of Light and Shadow, It Lives Series, High School Story, Open Heart, Foreign Affairs, Laws of Attraction, Big Sky Country, Endless Summer, Crown & Flame, Most Wanted, Hero There's also Nightbound, Perfect Match, Veil of Secrets, Heist: Monaco, Distant Shores, America's Most Eligible Pretty sure the genderlocked books are like pure romance ones Or motherhood ones I beg to differ, choices has been profiting off forced male love interests for years.  uwu M for Mini and W for Wumbo M is for Mara is my queen 👑 M is for MOM WHY CAN'T I GET A PET FROG I PROMISE ILL TAKE CARE OF IT 🐸 WOOOO Fake?? A ?? Wat I don't think we should throw around heavy terms like this, choices is a game that is mostly played by women so that's why they have more books for women, that doesn't mean they hate men. I do wish they gave us more GOC books with varying body types and hair options And more race options ?? I'm Tim, the default forg pet in The Elementalists Mara no like ping Hot Ok I'm removing the incel troll Goodbye I hope you make contact with a living vagina soon He's gone now Goodbye 👋 I hope he read this Anyway That was a weird experience Because women 100% of the time wants a breakup for just a tiny mistake

It is the 10th most common Vietnamese family name SEE What is it like to have a surname that's longer than 1 syllable Japanese people have long surnames tho Hanagawa, Takahata, Susaki, etc Hot Ooh what part of Asia r u from I notice Koreans, Chinese, viet people all have short surnames Wack Filipinos just have Hispanic surnames because waipipo :kermie_scree: Wanna see how much they changed us?

Also Myra from HSS Is that everyone i think she said it, i remember her saying so i think MC asks who her date is or something why not :0 theyre still characters arent they? uhh fictional villains idk i believe id want lgbtqia+ representation for all characters, villains included. but maybe thats just me? ^ i like dr doof i see more of a gray area with people i mean nobody is all bad or all good like for example, poppy owns a shelter. ? so is this about poppy...or pride? we are talking about pride rn uhhhh shes not in the server bc shes hot shes in the server "hypothetically" because she is queer we arent even planning to have her in the icon bc her sexuality isnt explicitly stated... i dont get why you're focusing on poppy being in the icon when what matters is pride month? ? i mean oookay but these are fictional characters and villains were also considered when making the icon we arent simping for her?? we r literally discussing the pride icon we...arent defending her adam, are you pressed about pride icons or poppy? because i literally just said she wont be on the icon i know but you keep bringing up poppy and our discussion was on pride icons fae was trying to help us find more characters for the TQ(I?)A+ week yep agreed, also i didnt know I was not supposed to be included. like the I in LGBTQIA is it not supposed to be there i had no idea tbh oh well in my pride parade back home they usually have a march but im not so sure oh alright, thanks for the info! for the record though, poppy lies under ambiguous sexuality. she wont be included until explicitly stated. man idk about bi/pan anymore but i just say bi not jenny tho shes a horny bastard GBHJKL TELL ME ALL THE DETAILS

Nah our cavities are drilled And then sprayed with acid And then filled up Drill I've also had 7 tooth fractures The cavity My dad's side is wack Don't marry your cousins people Nooo Ok let me explain Cavities are caused by bacteria Usually cavities are caused by lack of oral hygiene, genetics, or lots of sugar Anyway The cavity can be manifested by a mark on your tooth To remove it, the dentist drills a hole in said tooth and flushes it with acid. They fill it up with pasta. The end. Yes that's the magic tooth stuff No it's like a paste My teeth look great tho I have a killer smile because the pasta be bussin No My teeth have problems I lack a coating thing that makes it vulnerable to bacteria I also lack calcium So my teeth break and shatter Yeah I have lots of shattered teeth Sometimes when me and my dad eat, we pull out teeth lol.

I was a meanie in high school But in my school it was eat or be eaten :frogspinny: NOOOOO I would not. I only bullied those who started shit with me first. :tl1StarsPink: Lmao for real :NM_Squishy: I think the only girls I bullied were the ones who went after my friends!

Cause my other friend is like this and she doesn't have Asperger's Ok so my sister and I are polar opposites right? I'm extroverted, she's introverted. I like stuff that she may not like and vice versa. My sister gets special interests sometimes and they come in phases. Th phase rn is VTubers Idk if u know what those r Fucking AI streamers who are anime girls Idk tbh They're very loud and annoying Anyway I just give her space and whatever. It's not my cup of tea, but she likes it so that's fine. My sister is very insecure about her interests. Like VERY insecure. She gets defensive when you criticize her interests. It legitimately makes her upset. This is the concept I literally cannot grasp. Anyway she watches her vids whatever I don't care Which one And there's this 1 VTuber song I literally CANNOT stand I am fine with anything else but I literally cannot stand that one So I was like "can u not play that" And she went OFF Bitchass like "You think everything I watch is annoying it makes me not wanna watch in front of you" "it makes me feel like a loser with shit taste" Like.... HELLO??? I literally didn't say any of that I just said TURN IT OFF Well my exact words were: Can you mute that, you can literally play any other VTube song just not that one pls And she got mad Like.... :tlFrogKnife: But why ? :0  I mean it's hard for me to grasp. People like different things and that is ok She grew up an outcast ig because she was different Oh yea maybe :mmochathink: Oh but why does that matter? Sorry I don't mean to offend I just don't get that line of thinking. For me, it's like this is what I like and if you don't like it, that's fine.

That's what the dress technically looks like. However, given America's history w Chinese people, uhhhhh kinda weird. I wouldnt call her problematic but it's just weird.

At the very core of it, Pre-Cana is a way for couples to open a dialogue and discuss topics that need to be discussed before getting married: fiances, children, faith, career, etc. These may be topics that you have already discussed, but I think they're ones that couples try to avoid. It's not very romantic to sit down with your husband and decide who is going to balance the checkbook for the rest of your lives. But it's something that you need to decide because if you both hate knowing how much money is in your bank account, or if one of you just spends until you get an overdraft letter to stop you, that's something that can cause a conflict in your marriage. Pre-Cana starts that dialogue for you.

He was originally a woman who became a man but he dresses as a woman for work. It's great, I love how they fuck with gender. Aw man I'm sorry that they do that :/ that sucks Some people are ok with other people's lifestyles but they feel the need to control their children's Yeah exactly Lu Half ass support Oh Adam I meant to ask. If I do have a child that is trans and they want to take hormones and everything and do permanent changes to their body before puberty, is that ok? A lot of people say they should wait until the child is an adult like 18 or something Yeah idk I don't want my kid to face health problems but I don't want them to suffer in a body that isn't theirs That's my biggest worry tbh I have trans relatives so I just wanna be ready I actually learned a lot about the trans community through the drag community so I hope I'm getting the right info. But do some of them do facial surgery to look more masc/fem? What's a colon OH I thought you meant it as a slang term Hdiehdke Ok the actual colon I did see that! Someone had the top part of their head wrapped My fave drag queen who is a trans man (gottmik) got some jaw thingies? https://www.instagram.com/p/CMzvrEqAr1N/?utm_medium=copy_link They got the jaw implants I think I didn't know there were different types of top surgery I want booba reduction Which one r you getting You need someone to drive you home/to the hotel too Must be terrible to be misgendered My great-aunt (he wanted to be called this despite being trans ftm) changed his name to sound more masculine and we all referred to him by that Me? Yes Yeah that must feel absolutely terrible, that's why a lot of kids are suffering from clinical depression. They just want to be supported/acknowledged. :( Aw man I do hope Gen Z raises their kids to be better For sure, I know a lot of people my age who still live with their parents. It saves a ton of money. Preach Wot Asians would never Dhkshrj true Imagine having your boyfriend over and your mom busts in holding your granny panties and she's like "HEY  IS THIS CLEAN, DO I PUT THIS IN YOUR CLOSET" and u can't be mad because u technically live in their house. No boundaries with poc parents O noooo not a republican :angycat: SIR Yikes on bikes Remember those people on Tik Tok who are Christian and they roleplay being jailed because "liberals" What the actual fonk They roleplay being in jail because they believe in Jesus And are straight This pastor even made a Tik Tok telling Christians to stfu because white Christians have it good Thank you Adam OH wait I did have this one question although it's kind of controversial They do look painful Ok soooo I kinda asked a trans acquaintance about this, and they got mad at me soooo 😅😅😅 @faede pls feel free to answer too I kinda want to hear from people who aren't cis Ok sooo there's this YouTuber named NikkiTutorials and she came out as trans Oh sorry I'll be quick! Ok so NikkiTutorials is ftm and they didn't tell their fiancé until they were engaged (apparently)! So I'm just wondering, was it okay to do? Like she's a woman, definitely. But idk.... Idk my trans acquaintance told me I was transphobic for even asking. So I'm sorry if this is offensive I'm rly just clueless MTF My bad They got surgery and puberty blockers So they really passed But yeah I mean...should she have told him earlier? What if he wanted biological kids or something? What if he was transphobic? That kinda stuff Yeah exactly it was touchy for that acquaintance since she passes (until she opens her mouth) and she's been abandoned by dates after they hear her voice. Yeah I mean if it were me, I guess id be a little upset. Not because they "used to be male/female" but because I kind of expect total honesty in a relationship and if they didn't tell me id feel like they didn't trust me? Tho idk if that's selfish Yeah they fully transitioned in their teens And he met her after in her 20s? This is what she looks like Ohh stealth trans is a thing? :0 Interesting True Not all people have the stomach or desire to do it, I get easily upset with a lot of anti-lgbt topics so I am not a heavy activist It's tricky I'd date anyone tbh, I'm bi. I wouldn't mind adopting either. But I guess that's a deal breaker for some people and that's ok too. ah the big five So my sister is playing TRR I hate it here Sister: MC looks like she's trying to let out a silent fart 

Sister: *After Drake is introduced* This guy looks like he smelled my fart She should replace Kat Ebdkhrke "I read that as || cock ||" Sister: (About MC's smiling face) she looks like me when I accept gifts I don't want "Wow I'm a slut, im a tour guide to this bachelor party" I can't believe they let her type his name like that No like the weird capitalization lol Sukdeez and RaTpAtOoTiE forever "that's lame" I didn't catch it in video but 1.5 seconds later she said HARRYDIDYOUPUTYOURNAMEINTHEGOBLETOFFIRE She kissed the prince Man did you think I was the only chaotic one at home Man my sister is crazy Welcome to your trial Today you are here on five counts of public indecency and two counts of criminal trespassing How do you plead @Arzaylea you no longer have a color?

Therefore, if translated word-for-word, the phrase means "your mother that is a whore".[8]

However, most Tagalog speakers dispute this simplistic translation, instead alternately rendering the phrase as "son of a bitch"[9] or as a variation of the word "fuck" Pakshet is just fuck shit in a filipino accent Look it came from American contact Hello drunk I'm dad :shijudge: i am going to bed later scrubs @kyo view my ig story this is a threat When is surrender again Hmmm I had tofu nuggets Who is this he's so cute Frogress Beautiful I had junk food today :-( Not my proudest moment :CuteWiggle: I've been so busy with the baby too Love him Oh damn that's great, the Grammys should nominate more diverse artists I need to pee so bad I CANT IM TOO LAZY :VIP: I'm the UTI queen Mood, my teachers never let me pee I WILL PISS ON THIS FLOOR LINDA Teachers found it disrespectful when I asked to go to the bathroom Weird as fuck One time I drank water from my thermos and got yelled at She was like "did I tell you that you could drink water in my class?!"

Spinal disorders and conditions are taken very seriously by the military. Many of the jobs have stringent physical demands and standards, and having any sort of back issue can be detrimental to your health, and the readiness of the force. However, according to the Tucson recruiting office, as a result of spinal curvature misalignment, your butt can be too big for you to serve. Enough said.

He's permanently smirking I'm looking thru them rn hmmm God I wish I had a good picture to show but I was too shy to ask for a picture dhkshdkejs Yeah I'm starting to wonder if he's a misc character or a minor antagonist No but tbh he can call me anytime Hsjdkdbksjsks jk lsjejjdhsksjdhekjs Hoe hoe hoe Oh well I'll see him one day The sprite I mean But like I could've SWORN The sprite had on a blue chef uniform Almost positive And like the chef uniform had blue lapels Or sth Collar Nope :(( sorry bud It's ok Maybe he was never meant to be found Sorry ray ughhhhhhhhhshsvdjjsjs wait ray dm @Metta METTA I NEED YOU YES Jesus Omg Why did I say chef Hdkehekeje I'm sorry Hsksjdkrje He's actually got queer best friends irl I think his ex became a lesbian and they're still tight He's an oral surgeon he specializes in TMJ BSKSBSKNSMNS Operates on jaws Dislocated jaws And the like Yes actually If your jaw makes a clicking noise he can reset it back He was supposed to do that for me today but he forgot Hskdjkejdksj Hrkejroejrjrj Bro that's the condition he works on You should have that looked at ANjskejeke NO 😭😭😭 https://youtu.be/-iOzHoxsor4 I think I'm getting attached IM NOT IM JUST GETTING a lik A lil Yes IDK what's happening He's just so nice Nice to me What have I done Usually during Seggsytime HEJJEKDBEKSJ Nah he just says WELL he calls me babe and like texts me every day double texts or triple texts Calls me cute etc Not the same thing He adds on additional things Thanks uwu Always asks if I got home safe That kinda stuff :(((( aw ily THATS THE THING WE ONLY JUST MET But I'm getting infatuated We've known each other maybe 10 days He slid into Dem dms I mean we aren't dating Rule 1 was like No feelings AHhshdkejdkejs YET HERE I AM fuck No commitment And rule 3 is no matter what happens we stay friends Hdkehdksjdjdj WHAT HAVE I DONE Anyway today was extra sad for me so I lay on his chest while he rubbed my back and kissed my forehead and it was v nice NO JUST 1 we aren't committed And we are friends still I flirt with him a lot And he seems to reciprocate but I think he's just naturally flirty Like I said that he should introduce me to his doctor colleagues once I'm ready to get back into the dating pool again And he told me all his doctor friends were over forty And then I said okay I guess I'm settling for you And he said why not And then we both laughed But that's it Hmm I really like him as a person He's really caring and considerate and he puts himself before others LU HI Hskddhjs LU I have boy problems Help me momma We're just having fun tbh but we're getting to know each other too Yeah!

She's weird Well that's the thing!! I like him because he is the opposite of Jax 🥺 He's great in his own way Nah she always hated her So he helps out addicts in his spare time and visits rehab centers, he's really really forgiving like, someone stole his package and he shrugged it off and said that the person probably needed it more than he did He's into valo lmaoooo Self explanatory He's not afraid to get into stuff that are traditionally seen as dorky and kiddie because it makes him happy, he really really loves his mom and he pushes himself everyday to impress her. He's actually one of the youngest consulting doctors on the field. Hmmm When I was sad about Jax he let me lie down in his bed and he hugged me and made funny voices until I was okay He's REAAAAAAAAAAAAALLY good in bed hsjsjksjdks WHAT SHE TOLD ME TO NAME THINGS I LIKED Ooh Hmmm Well he's charismatic and funny and is super chivalrous. He loves kids and is a super feminist thanks to being raised by a single mom. He's super organized, smart and graduated early. He takes really good care of his friends and people he cares about. He's passionate about his hobbies. (That's all I could gather in 10 days) but tbh I will shop around I've given myself 1 year to be single And if I still like him after 1 year maybe I'll ask him out WHAT But older men r so cooool And good in bed Hsksdjksks But tbh if they're looking for someone younger it's kind of a weewoo 🥺 Yeah I'll give it a year Before jumping into anything Thanks guys I love yew I'm gonna go doctor shopping Tf Man yeah gotta be careful with older guys too huh He's 33 so 1989 WHAT But they're so hot Gdkdhdjdjd His hours are soooo shit tho God He's bailed on me a lot because idk he had to pick up someone else's shift for god knows why Mmmmm That's sad We do have limited time together He barely sleeps and I worry for him God I notice healthcare professionals live really unhealthy lives no offense like y'all don't sleep And he doesnt have time for homecooked food so everything is instant He also vapes lmao bro???? Ur a doctor Sorry what's a code :0 He says his colleagues are literal chainsmokers He thinks he's healthy for vaping Yeah I heard Wait Lu what's a code sorry Oh no :( Jeez idk if I can stomach that tbh Jesus I would probably cry from the stress Damn you deserve this vacation I can imagine some people have to be restrained too When I was in the ER in the US, I saw a person splash hot coffee on a male nurse and he didn't even flinch. Police asked him if he wanted to press charges and the guy just looked so dead inside he just said "nah" That shit was so wild to me That's a good idea tbh WTFDDDDBEDJDJD What the fuck is that shit I've only seen monkeys at the zoo do that shit Man healthcare is hard I thought he was making up excuses about picking up people's shifts Is that fr Doctors do that shit??
