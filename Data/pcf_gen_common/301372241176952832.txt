Do you have any ideas in mind Pardy is back Hey Fiona Aw yeah people can disappoint sometimes ask him to redo it Where is this @Tyr Oh no Wow I had no idea feenie was that bad I'm sorry you guys have to deal with that I left the original server because I was so uncomfortable with how he treated his members tbh Calling them asshol and stuff Yes before. But I felt uncomfortable so I left because it felt more like his personal server than a choices discussion server. He would get really worked up if you didn't share the same opinions etc Oh my Well I'm glad this server has less drama I'm trying to get more active members But the Reddit page (idk who runs it) says that there's already a discord whenever I try to advertise I think so :( where did you hear about this server btw? I'm glad you joined Oh there was a post calling it out? I had no idea Oh wow I had no idea but I'm glad you're here Doge LMAO what Oh great! Whenever I post to Reddit the admins tell me that there is already an existing server and links to the shitty one ??? What did we do These aren't rumors they're actual experiences by members and I don't think you should be invalidating how badly they were treated by feenie I'm open to your input on this but TBH we've all experienced bad stuff on the feenie server so I don't understand what rumors you're talking about  @Williukea Things aren't rumors anymore when they've been experienced firsthand I'm not saying what the members who grouped up on him were right I think people were wrong on both sides. I wasn't there so I wouldn't know what fully happened but what I'm saying is these are not rumors. They're actual things that happened and they're just sharing their experiences be it positive or negative i did not see that give me a sec exactly generalizing and calling us all mean is not very civil dammit pokecord p!edirect #deleted-channel p!redirect #deleted-channel i understand hes your friend and you're no lapdog. its normal to want to defend frieds but everyone here is allowed to have an opinion thats all im saying. i respect your opinion about our server and ill do my best to improve it will you  be on vc @9k4 aww alright best of luck!!

Back in elementary, they already noticed
My habits that didn't seem very ladylike, because
Instead of Chinese garter, I played teks and jolens
And my group of friends were always the tough boys around
 
When I got to high school, I became friends with bi-
Curious women who were looking for other women
Instead of a makeup kit, I carried around a guitar
And my outfit was always a long-sleeve t-shirt and faded jeans
 
But when I met you, my demeanor changed
I learned to re-bond my hair and fix my eyebrows at least once a month
I don't know what exactly it is about you that made me soften up so suddenly
Who would've thought that it would be a guy to capture a wild tiger like me?
 
Even if I'm a tomboy
My heart will still beat for you
Just one kiss from you and I'm struck
And my ladylikeness comes to life
Like a flower that's blooming
Because you care for it with water and the peaking sun
Of your every day love*
It lights up my life**
 
When the two of us got to college, only then did I give you the sweet 'Yes"
That you worked for for 10 months
Instead of chocolate and typical efforts
You captured me with poems and your cutesy songs
 
That's why when I met you, you knew right away that it was a miracle
I learned to wear high heels and I more often wore red dresses
But you had never hoped before that I would go on to change in order to prove
That there's no hard bread with the hot coffee of your love
 
Even if I'm a tomboy
My heart will still beat for you
Just one kiss from you and I'm struck
And my ladylikeness comes to life
Like a flower that's blooming
Because you care for it with water and the peaking sun
Of your every day love*
It lights up my life** lyrics ^^^ R i g h t they even made it a tv drama yeAH like lesbians cant be converted by cute guys ok yep i was pretty fuckin mad but its so fuckin catchy OOF do u ever like hate a song but its stuck in ur head its a very very catchy song so fml ive been singing it ITS SO CATCHY grr like remember blurred lines that misogynistic song it was stuck in my head truth ITS EVERYDAY BRO nah dude ricegums songs suck too no dude pls spare ur ears ugh right @Lexa  JOIIN üò† Oof Hey guys It's ya boi With a fever Typhoon coming Ayo Yo so many new people Yayy I have the FLU üò∑ I'm your mother Yes of course Isn't Taylor also 14 Ooh I'm 12 JK I'm 21 I'm 23 I'm 24 I'm bootylicious I'm suffering from fever Is it bad to shower when u have a fever Thankies Big mcthankies from mcspankies Lmao You're road This Filipina in a reality show had a thick accent so instead of Rude she said Road And the American guy she was talking to was like wha???

Ninki minjaj A real army understands the meaning behind the pictures. It‚Äôs all about criticizing idol life and there are also political references in the pictures, for example the number 1984, which is the name of a novel which is about perpetual war. If you look closely, you will see a big object which you would normally see behind the back of porcelain dolls to turn it a bit and make the doll speak or play a lil song. If you look even more carefully you will see, in  the closet they‚Äôre tied to something. Still didn‚Äôt get it? They‚Äôre in a closet. They look like dolls. They represent being objectified by the Kpop industry. Fake love reference: ‚Äûtry to erase myself and make me your doll‚Äú everything is linked together. But this is not enough. Let‚Äôs talk about the boxes. The eyes: constantly being watched
The cameras: every move is being judged
The hands: everyone expecting and wanting something from them
The boxes: they‚Äôre captured, there‚Äôs no escape 
The photos ARE MEANT to look ridiculous. They represent a circus.
Another reference (which is highly sensitive): remember when Korean women protested against public hidden cameras, which are used to film women to put them on porn sites? The female clothes which BTS wear and the cameras could be a reference to that. 
Let‚Äôs talk about the beautiful bubble pictures. Have you noticed Jungkook is the only one whose tree is dead? And that he‚Äôs the only one who wears completely black clothes? Remember the ly her pictures? They were lying between flowers. Means, we‚Äôve been in those unreal bubbles which isolates them from the world since ly: her. Do you understand now, that we don‚Äôt stan for our eyes to get pleased, we stan for our minds to get fucked up. If you stan for visuals, unstan. BTS is more than that. We stan for the social criticism they give us. We stan intellectuals, not visuals. Get tf out of this fandom if you can‚Äôt appreciate art and deep meanings.Ôªø This is a BTS copypasta I found Kpop stans can be so toxic ngl Stan twitter is a cesspool Wait what they have lore Lore about wat Wot Oh BTS has a member that looks like the ice age baby That's cute kinda like anime U know what's odd Idols not being allowed to have gfs or bfs That's wack If they're in relationships stans be mad Bro filipino koreaboos are wack Japanese idols are creepy because they're made to look like underage girls They get girls with snaggle teeth because it looks like they're young Some get surgery for their teeth to look like that Usually jpop idols have fans that are older men and that's weeeeird Don't most of em get cosmetic surgery His what now East Asian beauty standards are wack Southeast Asian beauty standards r also wack @‚ô° lilli lol my cousin auditioned w her girl group and everyone liked them except Simon because he said they looked "snooty" Anywaaay she gave up on the girl group and went on to be a West End performer Yea but sucks that Simon called them snooty Wtf about them is snooty they're all women of color Wack https://youtu.be/aO2yuQkHCWU This them What is ukpop What r they Never forgetti the Filipino boy band who got cancelled for their tweet about an island Oof wrong link https://mothership.sg/2019/12/hello-sb19/ We tried explaining that Negros is a name of an island but they were like THAT WIKIPEDIA PAGE LOOKS FAKE and I'm like....

This is the perfect way to irritate your friends. If you want them to get tired of you, fast, then you should try to copy and mimic everything your friend says and does. You can either be totally obvious about it, and just repeat everything your friend says, word for word, or you can be a bit more subtle, and copy your friend's gestures and movements instead. The obvious route will be more annoying, but your friend will tire of you faster. If you mimic everything your friend does, then it'll take longer for your friend to catch on but i mean im obviously really good at everything but i mean im obviously really good at everything gasp
im your friend?
jkjk who isnt my friend me

which was my old Username but i shed that mortal form a long time ago Tattletale on every little thing your sibling does. Another classic way to irritate your sibling is to tell your parents every wrong thing he or she does. It can be really minor, like not washing the dishes when he or she said she would. Do it was often as possible and make your sibling feel like he is constantly being watched by you. If you keep this up, you are likely to irritate your parents, too![9] MOOOOOM HP SAID SHUT UP MOOOOM DREW IS GONNA SACRIFICE HP MOOOOOOM HP SAYS YOU DONT CARE MOOOOM ALTAIR SAID THE F WORD MOOOM HP SAID THE F WORD MOOOOM ALTAIR IS DITCHING US OH FUCK MY MOM IS GONNA SEE MY TATTOO OK TIME TO YEET BOYS _GOD VIV OUT_ Go big or go homo My dog ditched me to sit on my dad's lap Fuckin betrayed Sad She don't love me I'm not caught up on rwby but p sure two of them are in lesbians with each other Yang and Blake or sth Which is p sad because I liked Sun ü§ò Yes Jk no yang has big pp Bigger pp Fuck my boss got mad Bc we brought the dogs to the office üëÄ The exterminator is fumigating the house what am I supposed to do woa @Altair so we are deleting all name roles in favor of #color-role-channel ? sweet Yo u know whose voice reminds me of @Water Puppies 's ??

There, a sadistic remote-controlled bear by the name of Monokuma announces that the students will be forced to live in the school forever, offering only one way to graduate: murder another student and get away with it. When a crime scene is discovered, a "class trial" (Â≠¶Á¥öË£ÅÂà§, gakky≈´ saiban) is held, in which the remaining students must discuss amongst themselves who the murderer is. If they can successfully figure out who murdered the victim, the culprit alone will be executed. However, if they guess incorrectly, the culprit will be able to leave the school and everyone else will be executed. ok who wants to join the game i will put your name into the simulator ok bread is in who else this is like the hunger games sim except its a killing game hello :< ok nvm i guess everyone be busy another time  then okieee so we have bread, lilli, jordan, furi, mango and viv OOO any last minute additions? no? ok we begin o shit ok lemme add u OK THIS IS THE LAST ONE WE START AFTER I ADD HILDA kk Here we go WAIT WTF Why are there 2 Lillis Bdndnbdjsj .....

All of these creatures maintain a code of secrecy, not allowing the human race to be aware of its existence due to lethal altercations throughout history.  Night People are governed by laws. Authoritative bodies such as the Night World Council make sure these laws are followed to prevent humans from knowing the Night World exists. A human who finds out about the Night World or its people should be killed according to these laws.

The Night World allows for the torment, conversion and killing of human beings, within reason and with permission, though for the most part the citizens of the Night World are indifferent to humans. However, there are two consistent cardinal laws: humans cannot be told of the Night World, and it is illegal to fall in love with one.

The novels focus on instances in which these two main laws, punishable by death, are broken. yeah elementalists literally... lifted the plot to twitches the disney movie sun and moon twins separated at birth with twitches plot yes alsooo did some movie steal some shit from TRR?? i saw some screenshots unless those were fake no like they legit had a guy named liam from cordonia i saw some screenshots of that on tumblr Found it Lmao bruh :(( so many ppl in my area r getting the virus yeah üò¶ like rly nearby no bc the philippine government sucks ass lmao yes @DaHomieDrew  üò¶ my grammy is 84 im rly scared for her she lives in my house sigh and i have a sore throat rn sooooo https://tenor.com/view/bettywhite-dab-gif-5044603 nois what r the symptoms anyway my grandma always gets pneumonia Pre-existing illnesses that put patients at higher risk:

They were privileged enough to have their family safe from Marcos. It really makes me sick that Ferdinand Marcos is buried in the same cemetery as my SOLDIER grandfather who actually fought for our country rather than steal from it. Truth ?????

I've seen people enter with courses their parents chose for them and they were fucking miserable. Some even ended up dropping out. Your major should be something that interests you! Yesss My parents made me do pre-med and.... I did not do well and I was sad I shifted to psychology and won awards for my research work!! You thrive when you're having fub Fun So yeah choose a major you love Because it's not work if it's fun ALSO make sure you check ratemyprofessor before signing up to any classes Some profs are .... Difficult Like some are really old and set in their ways and no matter how hard you try, they still give low marks. And that's definitely not your fault So yeah check out your profs Oh god one of my profs HATED me And he was the only prof teaching that subject so of course I had to take it He gave me a 2.0 and I was like u know what I'll take it @CoolCCMystery do u have a major in mind Maybe I could help you find one Ooh! English is great, if you're into literature I hear comparative literature majors make a lot of money.

Culinary is also super fun, my cousin graduated culinary arts. You do need balls of steel though because your profs are Gordon Ramsey levels of intense. Also you'll burn and cut yourself by accident.

Helping kiddos is super fun! You could go into teaching or special education! Special education is super fulfilling :) I'm going to take a postgrad in play therapy. I also have a part time job tutoring kids with autism :) Yeah I teach them English They're sweet, sometimes they're just cranky because they'd rather stay in bed all day. @Raven didn't u wanna do med Pre med was intense but it was p fun ngl I was in pre med for 2 years You could also do different kinds of science courses! @Deleted User no but I think Sloane is computer science major Sloane from perfect match ?? MCs are bums with no jobs tbh Lmao Most of them at least Besides OH MC The rest have jobs but active social lives and good sleep???

He was growing in my garden and I
Pulled him out by his hair like a weed
But like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So I figured this time I might as well let him be
Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend this song reminds me of my sister. she's a really grumpy antisocial weird goblin but i love her. hmm @DaHomieDrew  reminds me of this song https://open.spotify.com/track/3JvrhDOgAt6p7K8mDyZwRd?si=IIiaeUkcSfih2ZsdJwRMYQ HILDA WHY O LAWD maybe for me, it'd be

If you snore loudly and feel tired even after a full night's¬†sleep, you might have¬†sleep apnea. The main types of¬†sleep apnea¬†are: Obstructive¬†sleep apnea, the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax. People of¬†Asian¬†descent tend to have¬†more¬†severe obstructive sleep apnea than Caucasians of similar age and BMI. The findings¬†are¬†especially alarming because the Caucasians in the sample tended to be much¬†more¬†overweight than their¬†Asian¬†counterparts https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/news/20100309/sleep-habits-vary-by-ethnicity-survey-finds Yooo tag urself Wow 71% of black people in the poll prayed before bed Damn And only 18% of asians pray before bed How do people remember to pray I just pass out I never remember trying to fall asleep I just die on my bed for like 4 hours My family makes fun of the way I sleep It's rude as fuck I sleep w my mouth open And sometimes I sleep with my eyes open And then I wake up and there are pictures of me sleeping in the group chat and my family members are doing various poses in them U know Now that I think about it Maybe I do have a sleep disorder People say I convulse in my sleep What's urs BECAUSE IM INNOCENT KYO also my psychiatrist gave me 500mg of Xanax and I still couldn't sleep rip She gave me benadryl but apparently I'm allergic And benadryl is for allergies So I'm allergic to the  anti allergy medicine I did a thing when I was a kid where they hospitalized me to watch me sleep And they attached some electrodes on my head Yeah and they tried making noise And I was still dead asleep My nurse told me I could sleep through the apocalypse It rly is uncomfortable :/ How do u even sleep w those things on your scalp It's gross Sleep disorder gang Helicopter parents r d worst God I'm working from home and I'm supposed to text and call people to coordinate for my project etc And my parents claim I'm not working because "I never see you working" GOD Omg ILITW is god tier Ugh I miss those books @BigHutchHO do u know about that viral video of the Scottish man who was stuck on the roof @BigHutchHO https://youtu.be/HpVhSx0fZwM I died Jdkdhdke I lost it when he said wank stain You know when I see Scottish characters they're usually really angry all the time Is that accurate Question Do u have to pay to keep threep Was threep a diamond choice Or does he just join you I forget Also what's the password It's 7:43 am and I don't wanna think Nani the fuck What's an axiom Do u guys even read lore tablets I don't bother because it's so fucking long and boring I wish they presented it in a way that's less boring Looks like a shitty text story Oh man I'm leaning towards Tyril now he's such a soft babie Also ghost elf lady is hot 10/10 would smash YO WHAT THE HELL FUCKING JUMPSCARE In this chapter It's the elf thing after Tyril reads kayas letter Bro wtf This lady in Michigan went on strike because they closed the hair salon and she wanted to get her hair done What the fuccccck is wrong with America Look at the first few seconds of this vid @azula https://youtu.be/wlBYHk4n4dU Wtf why'd I tag myself Anyway The lady protesting about her hair is in the first few seconds Jesus Dude they're being selfish "The sick people are already being taken care of, we need to get our hair done" To be honest the lockdowns in America aren't even that strict???

Bruh I picked a fight with someone on twitter because they weren't making sense Like at all Some girl tweeted that all the issues in the Philippines were stressing her out and she wanted to move to Canada And he started bashing her and saying she was selfish because there are poor people in the Philippines and she's gonna ditch them Like ???????? If u have an opportunity for a better life, why aren't u allowed to take it???? That is true He said she was selfish because she is moving to have a better life for her and her newborn baby And like... Opportunities don't come to everyone and that's why they're so valuable. Why are you guilt tripping a teen mom for wanting free healthcare for her son ? TRUTH thats just like saying "Why are you eating???

Oh wow I haven't touched Snapchat in years I probably need it no meme tho üòÇ But they shut it down in my local hospital bc someone got covid Hello I'm gonna say it here. If Nanny Affair ever wins server icon, I'm not sure if I'm ok with that since we have minors and the cover is a half naked woman straddling a man I don't know if I should include it at all Yeah At least Witness has clothed people on the cover Exactly especially when the game is 12+ I kinda wanna bring that up with them.. literally my 13 year old cousin plays it I want them to separate the adults only books from the PG-13 ones Like Jesus Can't there be a separate place Exactly! I'm gonna have a word with PB on Facebook. When I heard my little cousin was playing Witness I was floored Oh god That was meant as a threat No they'd be like OH GOD MY EYESSSS Btw I sent choices a message Hi choices. I have a concern regarding your new book cover and your more adult-oriented books in general. I want to preface this by saying I love your game and I've been a long time fan since the beginning. 

I and many other fans have noticed the shift in adult-oriented content. Which is fine, I mean you do you. Facebook moms need to be appeased and all that. However, what concerns me is that there is a considerable amount of minors who play Choices. That being said, I feel like your more "racy" books should be placed in their own section, or at least have an AGE warning. 

My second concern is the cover of The Nanny Affair. I have a thirteen year old cousin who plays the game and her other friends play it too. I am uncomfortable with the very provocative cover being seen by her and the many other underage fans of Choices. The woman is half naked and straddling a man. If possible, could you come up with an alternative cover or at least hide it from children's eyes? 

I love Choices very much and I look forward to your new books. I just hope we make it a safe place for fans of ALL ages. I wish you all the best and hope you all keep safe, especially in this pandemic. They better though, this has to do with children. They could get in trouble with whoever does their game ratings @Jinii Minii I messaged the FB page. Is there another page where I can tell them stuff? Damn They don't reply on Instagram They've only ever replied to me on FB Oh I can't DM them on twt Y'all will see my twitter handle bdksbdkk I'm fine w Facebook Ugh This makes me v uncomfortable Exposing this to kids and all that The warning didn't even state what AGE they should be when reading It just said warning: seks Like ??? YASS COME THRU @Jinii Minii I want my boyfriend I haven't seen him in months yeah but if he plays games all day instead of talking to his girlfriend, DO I REALLY üòÇ I think that's the reason why he bought me a Switch Lite tbh. So I'd play all day and not notice that he's not paying attention to me üòí @Raven what prank Y'all think PB made the kids twins to save money? HAHAH Hdkdbdjkshksbdhsjsgd Omg But nobody talks like that here Someone please do one in a Filipino accent Question Does having drivers make you rich in the US? Oh I think around Asia it's standard to have maids, nannies and drivers Ooh in China, girls bind their feet to show they don't need to walk and their servants carry them. My grandma actually escaped that tradition by moving to the Philippines And now she has a generation of descendants with big feet lmfao I agree, most of the rich people in the Philippines are insensitive and entitled. But even middle class families have at least a maid Yeah I mean minimum wage over here is v cheap And they live with us usually so we provide food, lodging, toiletries, money and days off. Sometimes we help send their kids to school Hdkdvkejje NO not servants We call them helpers I'll admit tho, some people treat their helpers poorly Which breaks my heart really I have so much respect for people in the service industry Ugh my uncle treats his like fucking slaves and it breaks my heart There's no please or thank you It's just like "Open the gate NOW. Are you stupid?? Hurry up." And I'm like holy fuck I make sure I give his maids extra Christmas gifts just for putting up with him Eh he's so nice to people at his "level" But I think the real test of character is how u treat people who work for you My mom grew up poor so I'm not into that rich kid shit Yes he is It sucks because his maids and nannies are the sweetest He has a daughter with special needs and they treat her well Ding ding ding Ye Honestly though, rich people can be gross. I'm glad my mom grew up poor Naw tbh he is more feminine than his wife He's a stay at home dad while his wife brings home the money He doesn't subscribe to toxic masculinity Which is good He never worked a day in his life though, he's a trust fund baby Actually none of my dad's in-laws have ever worked in their life Except for my mom ü•∫ Now she's senior VP of one of the biggest corporations in the country and earns more than my dad so I'm very proud of her She really worked from the bottom Go mom Mom deadass made me believe we were poor Like the first 11 years of my life Which honestly helped a lot because I don't like designer clothes and bags And I'm like the cheapest bitch evet Ever GDKSBFJDJ same My mom carrying a Gucci bag: No, Viv. You can't have a barbie doll. We don't have money. Bdksbdjd My mom's mom was a child born in WW2 and she never finished elementary school. She became a dress maker and she married a soldier So like I guess my mom wanted me to grow up with humility too Ugh the nanny affair is... Actually better than Witness but I can't get over the fact that it's so unprofessional Lmfao I kinda squirm too thinking about how it's an AFFAIR I'd be horrified if my bf was boinking his kids' nanny And of course they make Sofia out to be a bitch so people root for the cheater If he cheated on Sofia he will cheat on MC Plain and simple What makes MC think that Sam respects their relationship when he couldn't even commit to his fiance Ok rant over It's just as someone who's been in a relationship for 7 years it really irks me how irresponsible these two characters are Well, almost 7 years. It'll be our anniversary in July and I doubt I'll even see him :( Wtf No it's not Vsksvdjebd My deepest fantasy is being able to eat without gaining weight I hate FB mom's Moms*** They're so racist and homophobic on the FB group They don't even try to hide it Tbf they actually pay for the game I remember when they revealed Charlie for the DS sneak peek a lot of them were like "EWWW a lesbo??? Where's the boy?" Like shut up charlie is hotter than you'll ever be Susan @Ne-Rwby-On choices has a fan club on FB and it's composed of 40 year old mothers They adore baby bump and other wedding books Like ???? U already have kids and a husband so like plan your own damn wedding or get pregnant idc Idk some people don't even know the FB group exists They're hella racist too When the DS cover came out they rioted because the pirate on the cover wasn't blonde with blue eyes Like stfu Jennifer What do u mean I'm in the group Gdjsjdj Yes @DaHomieDrew I see u And I hate how they're like IF U DONT LIKE BABY BUMP THEN DONT READ IT DUHHHHHHHHHH Don't tell me what to do Geraldine @DaHomieDrew it's usually in d comments Someone posts a pic of the cover/LIs and you get a bunch of angry moms in the comments Also maybe 35% of the people commenting are filipino and I'm not surprised Ugh There are FOUR nations of the fandom Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit and Discord Everything changed when the FB moms attacked FB moms - hate POC and gay characters, love wedding and baby books

Tumblr - LOVE gay characters and shit on generic white LIs 

Reddit - Doesn't really care about that stuff, more focused on theories and lore + PB updates

Discord - YOHO YOHO A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME Thanks I've been in all the nations I must say tho Tumblr has the funniest memes I'm in all of it Tho I lurk on FB and Reddit PB replied Thanks for the feedback, Redacted. Rest assured that we'll share this with the rest of the team. @kyo was my description accurate Of course it's FB They pay Those chumps use iPhones and don't know what APK means Man I hate the Facebook moms Look what they've done to choices Ugh Truth my bro I can't believe they killed it lives Just when I started to become relevant to the plot I being joss Joss queen Make joss and LI People are so rude cancelling Joss like that I was a bully in high school Now I'm not I'm a bully at work jk Viv is Jocelyn and Viv works for Choices were old jokes only OG server members know about Aka Doge, Benji, GB, zee, etc Oof I deadass miss the psych ward now that they shut it down REEEE But yeah, if you noticed I was rarely on the server in 2019, that is why.

May I know if you're looking for anything specific?" And the man looked her dead in the eye and said "you japanese?" And she was like.... No I'm a tour guide the fuck Rightttt And my sister is having an even harder time renewing her visa because lmao Chinese last name This is not a very good time to be Chinese Or Asian Or a POC in general because I hear POCs have the most cases Yeahh I saw that most of the infected are African Americans and Latinos Which sucks That's the data I read from NYC anyway Not sure about other places Dam Ree I think I can start going to work in June But like...

I think she only got to the 5th grade. Yeahhhh Colonization is not pretty If we weren't colonized then we'd be so happy tbh. Women had equal rights with men, no oppressive religion, etc. :WTFthonk: Also lmao to add to what @Altair  said, a 60 year old man was tackled to the ground and beaten by multiple policemen because he was not wearing a mask while watering the plants outside his house Sooooo Yeah u do NOT fuck with filipino police They're trigger happy and can do whatever they want Nah he was sent to the emergency room for fractures But apparently the police want him deported So I guess he's getting booted out No, nobody has command over the police but the president.

If u go outside u die. And even if u don't die u end up killing someone's grandma Hi hyper Also my doctor just told me not to go outside at all because I can't wear a mask :WTFthonk: Nah nah I didn't mean to phrase it as a hasty generalization I mean some Americans Others r p cool I'm ok, I just have a heart problem and I don't get enough oxygen in my body in general So like I can't wear a mask for too long Hdkdhdkdjd My sister studies in the south and she says people are generally nice and polite But eh it rly depends on which area in the south She told me people in Atlanta were generally rly mean to her Some guy saw her and my dad and started filming them like on selfie mode And she was like... "Can I help you?" And the guy was just like "Can you say hi" I have no idea what he's done w that footage but that was weird Also she gets a fair share of racist white parents (she's a school tour guide) but other than that, people in her area r p chill. My dad pulled her out of school tho bc he was afraid of Asian American targeted violence but she told me that usually happens in the east or west coast ü§∑ Idk bskde that's what she said But :0 I really doubt schools will let kids in this year anyway They are projecting that students may return by August or September but that's a little too hopeful Hahaha tbh üòÇ I haven't talked to anyone outside of my family It's driving me insane and everyone I know has been getting a Tik Tok account and I don't wanna be next > like, i hate these people
> like i love them
> but holy shit
Mood Nah they're like MAKING Tik toks of them dancing Also I just discovered POV tiktoks exist and it made me wanna jump off a bridge Some tiktoks r cool ig like the ones w actual original content Plus I can never focus on therapy over zoom because my therapist set her background to a photo of the beach and it distracts the hell out of me And I told her to remove it but she said she didn't know how dhksbdkdnd I miss my boyfriend His hair is SO long now. He hasn't had a haircut in months. It's forced LDR the only interaction I enjoyed today was when my cat brushed up against my leg And like he doesn't do that ever idk why he did that Dude I had a kitten and the vet said it was a girl so I named her bianca 9 months later SHE HAS BALLS We can't even change her name anymore bc she's so used to Bianca @Ne-Rwby-On  I suggest you see a therapist on zoom My cats actually come when I call them by their names Wack They do that little trot thing Hsjshdjsb Cats r brats I have a black cat named Monty A few months ago he got bit in the ass by a neighbor dog I thought he was gonna die BC we couldn't find him anywhere and when we did, he already lost a lot of blood. But we took him to the vet anyway and he got his ass stitched up and now he's fine Lmao He really had a bite mark on his butt I love black cats so much tho, they're so elegant. Orange ones r cool too @Water Puppies  you have two cats right I remember you sending a pic of two cats Oh wow What kind of cats do u have They're really furry My cats r just alley cats Aww Which one is the new one Was he a kitten We have a shit ton of cats back at my university and they'd randomly attack people for no reason Ah nice Kittens are v cute But man cats r assholes My cat woke me up once by showing me his bootyhole Like I just felt his tail on my nose and I woke up and I just saw his bootyhole Tbh tho I say I like dogs better but my new dog is basically a cat She's a brat and she throws tantrums when she wants something and ignores us when we wanna hug her Then when we're busy and she wants attention she will either bark at us or bite us We r simps My dad tried to walk our cat once Idk what he was thinking But the cat was upset and it started clawing at his leg and that was the end of that Oh god the cat was so upset It refused to look at him for a week Didn't they suspect that his appearance was made by a body double I don't understand how they'd benefit from hiding his death His sister is a literal clone who's just as ruthless Also @kyo I hope u find one!! I think some do sessions over zoom. Jesus it's 31C @Weiss  wow my doctor just scans it to me and I print it out üòÜ @kyo  i was like that the first month of quarantine. i only had like 2-4 hr naps. @Altair when is the meeting again fghjk ayt @BigHutchHO  how is it Yay @BigHutchHO  hope you'll be ok!!!

It makes me so sad to see people in power abuse others like this. No no I'm talking about George floyd Yeah it's all over the news. Even over on this side of the world. Yeah They were fired but I think murder charges should be given out The Philippines Yep Definitely. They should rot in jail. It's so disturbing. I have African-American relatives in the US (in-laws) and I feel for them, I really do. They're absolutely terrified of police I can't imagine fearing for my life whenever I see people who are supposed to protect me It's so unfair I don't think he got beaten, he was choked. The officer put his weight on him Yeah People were screaming at the cop to get off him Yeah They were telling at the cop yes Even a firefighter told the cop to back off and check for the pulse Sigh Why do it be like that Ye Incompetent as fuck Ah, I hate that Karen White people pretending to be hurt when literally the black person is standing right next to them and hasn't touched them at all Even I'll acknowledge that as an East Asian, we are not as discriminated against by the police because we have fairer skin tones and that's messed up. Dog was taken by a rescue too It's really colorism It fucking sucks Did you hear about Karamo from Queer Eye They did a prank on him while he was driving and he nearly quit the show Police Idk they thought it would be funny and the production crew knew all about it https://www.bustle.com/p/tan-france-almost-quit-queer-eye-you-actually-watched-the-moment-play-out-without-knowing-it-9034664 "I whipped out my phone so fast to start recording [the incident]," Van Ness¬†recalled to¬†Entertainment Weekly,¬†"and I did not know we were getting pulled over. I was super-duper uncomfortable." After Brown got out of the car, the "set-up" was revealed, but he and France ‚Äî who is British-Pakastani and the only other person of color on the show ‚Äî¬†were furious. It's not a good prank Yep And the white boomers who protested lockdown didn't get the tear gas I wonder why Right? So many people are convinced that this doesn't happen anymore but it does every day Yeah, I hear British police are much less of a threat Yeah. No guns and less instances of brutality. Yeah... American cops are yikes I remember a cop coming up to me when I was in the US and I fucking cried because I was so scared True there still are incidents All over the world really There's this Netflix movie called American Son that everyone should see. @Andromeda pls put the R word on spoilers But yeah I heard about that Man even south and Southeast asians aren't that safe. It really has to do with the color of your skin. Yep. Pretty much. I'm in that gray area between pale and tan so I never really know what I'm gonna get @literal legend.  mood Southeast Asian and East Asian I don't even know if I would be considered dark skinned in the west I'm considered dark over here in Asia TRUE @literal legend. And yeah Chinese people are racist Wait, Americans/Europeans I'm gonna show you a picture of me can you tell me if I'm considered pale or tan in your country ? Thank you! The beads are Chinese good luck charms So yeah would I be considered dark where you're at Ah yeah when I was in the UK there were very little East Asian people Some teenagers picked on my family In the tube :/ They were patting our heads and laughing at us They thought we couldn't speak English I had enough and I said "Touch me again and I'll break your fucking fingers" And they ran off It's alright. My dad got most of the teasing since he's 100% Chinese and looks like he can't speak English. My dad said "They're doing this because we are colored" and that was really sad to hear Tbh my family is fucking terrified of white people They don't say anything when white people are rude Because 
1. They're physically bigger and stronger 
2. Police will listen to them, not us Oh god I had someone say Nihao to me in the Philippines I nearly whooped his ass It sucks being mixed in general. I'm not accepted in either race. Chinese think I'm too filipino, Filipinos think I'm too Chinese Like WHERE DO I GO THEN Gang gang üëä Omg Truth Salt and pepper as seasoning Man why are white people so tall My dad is 5'4 My mom and sister and I are 5'2 Ugh that's not always the case Omg I took a white friend out for Asian food and he asked if it was spicy and I was like "nah" And he was fucking dying he said it was so spicy Like ....no it isn't The menu said it was no spice but idk I don't even have a great tolerance for spice tbh I absolutely love South Asian food but I die on the inside because it's so spicy Korean and Indian food are like the spiciest I absolutely love Shahi Paneer, tikka Masala & butter chicken Ugh it's so good üò© and even their vegetarian dishes?? Like they can get bland vegetables and turn them into flavorful dishes Right? Ugh I love it so much. Curry is my favorite food in general. Japanese, Indian, Thai All great Truth!!! I hate how people think of Asian food as dumplings and rice there's so much more!!! I grew up next to Indian neighbors and omg they had the best food and they were so fucking nice. The mom even gave me a henna tattoo pen that are used by brides. Right? She showed me the ones she had when she got married it was beautiful They were Hindu, they had statues all over the house. They absolutely loved how I appreciated their culture since most east asians discriminate against them. I honestly find Indian culture to be beautiful down to their religions and architecture and food. What a colorful place What's up Rice usually What about you? Is there anything other than rice??? OH I would eat Naan too but it's so hard to find over here :( They always serve it with rice where I'm at Yeah! I have tried roti with curry before though and omg it's life changing. True! They usually have frozen/instant ones that aren't good :( You can't be Asian and not own a rice cooker When I was in the US for a month I cried because I missed rice Like the soft white rice ü•∫ Right? It's so weird and dry and thin I like thicc rice Omg controversial opinion but I hate thick noodles I don't lik chewing my noodles The swirl ones?

ah i interpreted "rolling out vip" as giving it to EVERYONE for free, i misunderstood itg. yeah but id rather have less than 200 and have it full of inactives makes us more susceptible to raids and spam and whatnot they'll be fair im tired of rules being too subjective from mod to mod. these new set of rules will give solid examples so that it isn't up to the mod's opinion or pov. if it infringes the rules, you get punished. if it doesn't, then no punishment will be enacted. fghuio HP THATS THE LAST PING I PROMISE noooo sxcdfgh it's self-assignable he has to assign it to himself yes but :pleb: i am good admin AND I OOP @Water Puppies  yes, hot pocket?

Despite the ban, two Winnie the Pooh-themed rides appear in¬†Disneyland Shanghai.[62] When someone pisses me off on PubG I just sing the Winnie the Pooh theme song in Mandarin Then he gets booted from the game Lmao Btw @MaralinaSakura I have question about the UK Do ppl actually like/care about the royal family My friend from the UK hates them so much and he's glad (one of them??)

Their names are racist (‚ÄúSi‚Äù and ‚ÄúAm‚Äù), their design is racist (those teeth), their voices are racist (that broken English and accent), and the music is racist (that gong). Their role in the plot is also racist: these Asian absolutely trash Lady‚Äôs home, and frame her for the whole thing. They‚Äôre outright villains. Lmao I remember watching it as a kid and I was like wow what the fuck @Strife Usually Asian jokes are used with Siamese cats Disney was HELLA racist I think the most racist ones were directed at African Americans and Native Americans Because OOF have u seen Peter pan @Strife wasup Oh my mom is asleep next to me But we can dm Man Also Disney screwed over a relative of mine Like he did majority of the work for one of the films and he did not receive credit He only got recognized in the 2010s iirc Yeah Look him up, his name is Tyrus Wong. He was a brilliant man So now you know why Bambi's background art looks like Chinese paintings Bc it rly is Chinese paintings He died on New Year's Eve. I was so sad :-( True He was a great man He spent retirement making kites One of the kites Ah Did u not see the racist native American song That shit was so hard to watch https://youtu.be/f7yE8TKUB_M Nah it was straight up racist I watched it again and I was like üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è Yeah it rly is I can't even sit through the entire thing I cringe too hard @–≤–µ—Ä–∞  more racist way (skin color) I saw it when I was 5 or something Yeahhh It's real bad I didn't notice the racism as a kid (except for the Siamese ones) My dad taught me at a very young age that if someone makes fun of you by exaggerating your features or making fun of your language, you punch them in the throat.

Most of us are minorities OH Where were they even from American squad? That's a very weird statement this server is mostly minorities. POC, LGBT, and more. Weird I think it wouldn't hurt to include male and nb MCs Many choices fans are actually gender nonconforming Right? Except for that 1 token character they have so they can say they're inclusive Truly I wanted choices to include pronouns Aisha is MTF right I didn't play the book I wouldn't mind having an NB LI but Facebook moms would be angry I remember Facebook moms were hella fucking racist because they used a black female LI to market NB And they were like WHY IS SHE WOMAN WHY ISNT SHE BLONDE WOMAN A :mmNo: Yes yes yes Just like how || racists and neo Nazis || were fans of Rick and Morty so they made it a point to make fun of them and beat them up on the show RPDR COLLAB YAS What They added lea Michele Lmao That didn't age well I'll tell u that Hey @Deleted User Lea Michele is a shithead Nah dude She racist as hell And she bullied the poc actors on Glee She a shithead https://i.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/entertainment-top-stories/121744305/lea-micheles-apology-backfires-more-actors-accuse-her-of-bullying She's an asshole Huh I sent an article Lea is horrible I wouldn't even fuck especially after she told a black actress she would take a shit in her wig That's just no > If u think about it, she plays the role of a neurotic bitch too wellüòÇ

It was so good, they both stayed in the competition. It was an elimination round. Omg priy It's LEGENDARY I remember watching this live and screaming https://www.facebook.com/2307038339618652/videos/512889762579375/?extid=cGCNKvPlxjJieCC6 @Deleted User YoURE WELcome I died It slays me every time RIGHT they only do that to the very best RIGHT ugh I watch that video once a week and i just crie every time We NEED an Indian queen on the show I swear, I'd love to see the fabulous looks they'd turn out ü•∫ No the two queens you saw were not trans! Drag queens are basically men (usually gay men) who dress like women and perform on stage These are the 2 you saw out of drag But yes! There are trans people who do drag. Usually MTF. RuPaul made drag mainstream in Hollywood so he has a show now where other drag queens compete. And if you ask how they hide their You Know What, oh boy... you're gonna have to brace yourself. @Deleted User Yep! But drag queen = a man who dresses and performs as a woman professionally Drag race is so fucking chaotic, so many memes too Are they cis men irl MMM I guess but traditionally, drag queens perform at night clubs and stuff! There are more drag queens on tv but that's a new thing considering how Hollywood was (and still is) homophobic Drag race is so fucking chaotic https://youtu.be/XlQpM7JRoHQ Tag urself staff edition Trinity talking seriously is @kyo running the server 

Shea kack-kack-powing on the floor is Viv and her knowledge of discord 

Valentina screaming while Trinity removes her boob tape is @red hot silly pepper 

Two queens cringing in the background are @Weiss & @Strife > In India, we used to have *Ram leela* which is basically like a skit on Ramayana every year during dussera. There, men used to act as women bc it was inapropriate for women to act in those skits

I clearly have a type MHmm Ah fuck Forgot to play new QB Is it any good Wait hol up Need a question answered on #queen-b Bruh I'm so heated #choices-chat But yeah @DaHomieDrew as I was saying, I feel like East/Southeast Asians are pretty "lucky" compared to folks with darker skin. White people don't see Asians as a threat and yes, although we experience racism every day, I don't think it compares to that of African Americans and Latinx > Well, Asia is usually praised a lot for its work and production, plus they are famed a lot for beauty :nicothinking:
@MaralinaSakura I hate that this is the case because it crosses over to fetishization It's gross U see teenage white girls calling grown ass Asian men their "uwu baby senpai" it's fuckin wack And Asian women are ...a whole ass tag on p&rnhub I feel like it's extra extra weird with asians. Especially since we are portrayed as submissive, baby-like, cute, harmless Like bruh I'm 23 I'm not ur baby Exactly I haven't worn a school uniform in like 5 years Jesus God I hate it I know shit tons of asians that go to jail for murder tell him to talk to them :WTFthonk: ALSO I have a bone to pick with East asians Especially with their treatment of Southeast/South Asians > ALSO I have a bone to pick with East asians
 me as the spiderman meme Idk man I feel like people lift up East asians (Chinese, japanese, Korean) And they shit on the darker skinned asians (Vietnamese, Filipino, Malaysian, etc) Zzz maybe if u didn't wreck our country we would be just as successful @westerners > because they have a rep for being technologically and socially advanced while the rest of them "have some catching up to do"
@DaHomieDrew I was 5 months ago years old when I found out I have Vietnamese roots Im half East Asian, half southeast Asian but I have a darker(??) Complexion Id say I'm in the middle of yellow and brown Meh I just know I'm too light to be accepted by Filipinos and too dark to be accepted by the Chinese Truly Gotta be pale, skinny, pointy nose, have white people eyelids God, do they ever do that thing where they make a game out of guessing what "kind of Asian" you are I fuckin hate that Also hate how whenever I ask someone for directions they try to converse with me in broken Chinese like

"My brother is dating an Asian haha Nihao that means hi" > as someone who went to a majority white elementary school, i've only ever been pointed at by obnoxious Caucasian kids claiming that im Chinese. its gotten to the point where i got tired of correcting them
@DaHomieDrew hfkdhfkdhdkd THEY THINK THEY KNOW BETTER THAN U I am Chinese but I don't wanna speak to them in Chinese tf They're so amused by asians speaking native tongues but they hate it when Latinx people speak Spanish Where is the logic in that Oh lawd yeah Foreign guest comes into my house, points at my Yorkie and asks if it's my pet or dinner > so that makes me a math genius?
@DaHomieDrew I'm dyslexic to numbers RIght Like NO THATS NOT MY DINNER THATS MY BABY TF Wahh thank you üò≠ I'm super pale because I have unfortunately caught the virus > What the heck is I and A

Rusty was a huge part of your life He knew he had given you the support you needed all those years and now it's time for him to rest üíñ My dog stayed with me throughout my childhood. I was 10 and she died when I was 22. I didn't have a lot of friends growing up so she was my best friend. In college, I came out of my shell and made lots of friends. I think that's when my dog realized that it was ok, I was in good hands and she could go.

Cousin advice What @Deleted User Sorry ok here it is As you may know I've been sick for a month Oh no it's ok I can post it here Anyway yeah I've been sick and while I've been sick, my aunt passed away. She was a single mom with a grown up son Her son (my cousin) is blowing up my fukn phone asking me for money But 
1. I just started at my job and I don't have money
2. I paid upwards of 500usd on the memorial service 3. You're 30 and I just graduated college So like... Was I an asshole for saying no > Why
@Deleted User wym Oh because he has none, he spends it all on vaping and buying electronics. BUT his mom just died so I feel bad :hawyee: But idk he made me feel like shit after And get this, I found out my mom had sent him money days before he asked me. That means he spent all that in a couple of days. :( I guess Idk my aunt would've wanted her son to be caref for I mean I'll make sure he doesn't starve of course but Jesus he's 30 and asking a 20 something year old for money > How can you help him when you think you can barley afford to help yourself rn?
@mango.exe that's the tea periodt Thanks bb @mango.exe Oh @Deleted User @Deleted User I have a dumb question I have a Bangladeshi team mate on pubg, does he speak the same language as you guys?

They usually don't mind w pfps. @Deleted User what do you mean exactly Sorry, didn't understand your phrasing > Oh, really?? I know that you should always ask Japanese artists because they could get DMCAs or legal trouble because of copyright
@MaralinaSakura really?? Usually when I make it my pfp I credit them or give them a follow. Then again, idk if I've used any japanese artists. @Deleted User  yeah, I don't think anyone likes drama! I think as long as everyone follows the rules, they'll be fine. @MaralinaSakura these r my faves First one is from Pixiv by a Chinese artist iirc Chinese people are masters of bootleg and pirating shit so brksjdhdjd Uhh yeah, I think so! General is fine @Deleted User @MaralinaSakura second one I believe is by an artist named YukiSakura No, I play Choices exclusively. Mainly because I have the mod.

I wish you the best of luck @Brohepsi For what it's worth, my friend who is transitioning had his eggs frozen in case he wanted kids in the future. Did u know people have surgery to remove their ribs for cosmetic purposes Saw a documentary on a human barbie who wanted to look like barbie so she removed her last two ribs So he could woohoo his own hoo-ha Holy fuck British jin scares me Also he had surgery to slant his eyes and that's racist as fuck https://youtu.be/f_MgAeIkGTQ Noah fence but people like him are the reason why I have an aversion to Kpop I feel like a lot of the fans are creepy and have 0 boundaries And fetishize these grown ass men As an East Asian, I rly find those crazy stans creepy. It's like they use Korean culture as an aesthetic and they dehumanize these idols by infantilizing them. But that's just me Like no, he's not your baby boy or whatever, he's a man in his 20s. I hate that they're reducing these talented singers/dancers to baby boy uwu > It's the same with Asian women and ||porn||
@Brohepsi truly Like I'm fine with Kpop, not my cup of tea but I won't deny their talent. It's just the weird fan girls that really put me off. I see white women speaking broken Korean on twitter and it's just :LMFAOdead: True Fan girls/boys who claim ownership over these idols are the creepiest for real I don't like how girls are portrayed in anime in general Passive, annoying, needy Glad anime is starting to show realistic women Gskshdkebd Boing boing Anime is starting to make fun of that tho I like that they're making girls more goofy and funny in modern anime I think @BigHutchHO would like this anime https://youtu.be/3tQPjBZ7-P8 Reminds me of the kind of humor he likes I have a female friend in japan Most women in japan are pretty bashful and sweet Oh god üòÇ I love that anime it's so fucking stupid @BigHutchHO and his friend Olivia, probably.

Very gentle and quiet and affectionate. We have no idea what happened but I feel like this is a ruse. If my house catches on fire and my family goes missing, you'll know it's Kyo the dog. Today he walked up to me and politely asked to be petted (he didn't even shatter my eardrums) What a weird dog Too good :mmNo: I see right through him Robert Pattinson has covid Oof His kids are young Ree Why did they have people over Here's hoping they're mild cases Covid sucks ass Hmm Thinking of more pitches for pb 50 shades but instead of BDSM it's Christian gray treating his secretary nicely in exchange for fair compensation Yes Oh @Purplesim  :( @Purplesim  you still in Mindanao?

@Purplesim oh yeah she's fucking beautiful @Strife HELP I need a translator :--( https://twitter.com/Sibbil_?s=09 Oh fuck does it say commissions closed RaAaaAAA Thanks boss No I was broke Me too That's the only plus Oh Idk I just hate the quality of episode stories They don't even try + all sounds like Wattpad bs When did Braidwood manor come out Ah Thought they took inspiration from the Hill House show on Netflix But PB was first apparently Weird cause the poster for Hill House looks like Braidwoods book cover too Ahh man I miss hss Hmm Omg I completely forgot, I only played class act book 1 Preeetty sure I got that childhood friend Rory Ay putang ina It's almost the middle of September üëÅÔ∏è I'll probably post the poll in a few days Oof I hate u 2020 Thank u next I think I'll have to skip grad school this year... üò© I'm what they call a covid long hauler My joints are all swollen and I still have no sense of taste (but covid is gone thankfully) I can't believe I have arthritis at 23 How dare u @2020 I was about to enroll! But I think I will sit this one out Ah trying to get my masters in clinical psychology But 2020 is ass and it won't let me study Oooh Best of luck max üòâ Oof boss I'm old I've never seen boss freak out about grad school > Undergrad definitely isn't like it is in Choices lmao
@Maxroberts99 oh lawd definitely not, wish I had the hot roommates and the expensive ass dorm room But college is just .... Ha ha ha Have this 11 second song about college https://youtu.be/YMcGLQ-RZ44 That was me all throughout > GE is what makes undergrad so unfun
@Altair ah we only did that for the first 2 years Last 2 were just major subjects related to your course God I remember college algebra My dyscalculic ass O god good luck Oog Ooh I had history I don't remember what the fuck I learned though Oh fuck Good thing I had it in the afternoon My morning classes were science classes and I fuckin REEEE What's your major max > THE ONLY SESSION THAT WAS AVAILABLE WAS 10-11
@Altair that's not so early!! don't classes start at 7:30 Ah English! Sounds fun All my classes started 7:30 I nodded off in all of them Oh I remember I was supposed to be a creative writing major You can teach! My friends who graduated with a BA in english are teachers now Their kids keep doing Tik Tok dances Ooh Hmm, I have another friend who works for a magazine. Yeaa You could be an ESL tutor Ohh you'd need extra years to complete that right My cousin graduated with hotel restaurant management Major in culinary arts She used to be the most sensitive person ever but holy fuck her profs were meaner than Gordon Ramsay and now she has balls of steel Ugh I can't imagine being in customer service I would probably go to jail for whooping a Karen's ass Mandarin Jk don't It's a trap Yeah I'd lose my patience for sure Plus so many people are entitled as fuck and I can't imagine having to eat their ass for a paycheck True You could pick up a minor to supplement your English degree Ooh My boyfriend is in law school I keep asking him how it is but he just keeps sending this photo in response So uh Is it hard in the US In the Philippines, the entrance exams are easy and you get in as long as you pass. Staying in however is a different story 20% of the class drops out in the first week :LMFAOdead: Kind of a smart tactic tbh, they collect your enrollment money and then they yeet you into the sun. I'm gonna be a child psychologist!! I think that would be fun Love working w kids > But the odds of getting into that are slim to none
@Maxroberts99 yeah you need an "in" in the Industry > im prolly gonna be doing drug/mental health counseling of some kind

Like he could be rock or water or slime I'd love to be jello Idk what kinda power would I have Based on your impressions of me Kyo would have telekenisis Like eleven Like Eleven's powers I could see Kyo as a dimension hopper Which element would I control I can see Kyo dimension hopping Rae probably healing or talking to the dead > what would i do tho
@kyo hop to dimensions where you can explore new worlds and open portals for ppl You can go anywhere!!

Yes??? But she says "nah it'll be fine, if I give her the room that'll be the death of my Instagram" WHY did you have a baby No it isn't She has a full-time job as a female executive and she's paid well Instagram is her hobby She even pays 10k php a month to promote her page That's 200usd So annoying that she doesn't understand how a child's brain works and yet she had a child anyway üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è Also she makes her kid hella hungry because she takes extra long to prepare her _√¶sthetic_ baby food She has lots of children's books but she uses them to pose with her kid and pretends that she's reading to her but she rly isn't it's just for pics Like to me, it's p fucked up but idk if it's fucked up by other people's standards y'know?

OoF Also got in trouble for field trip because I convinced everyone our cabin was haunted Wtf is that allowed Attendance is mandatory in my college Same with mine Anyway the field trip story is a good one. We stayed in a haunted monastery and I told some classmates that I saw a headless man in our cabin. I told them he knocks on the walls every 3am So yknow I picked a bed by the wall and waited til 3 Then scratched at the walls, knocked and stuff Before you know it there were 30 screaming girls running around the monastery :elmofire: IM A CHANGED MAN NOW I don't pull that shit anymore Because idk when you turn 18 there's something called jail I would not like to go there What kinda food We always had Shawarma and Takoyaki stalls I miss Takoyaki üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è Oooh same Omg are we in the same school jk I miss school RAAAAA what are you studying max Wut Oh accounting I thought you meant almost accountant as you dropped it and studied sth else Because by that logic I'm an almost premed student Max you're from Argentina right üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è FORGIVE ME my memory sucks ass Oooo My husband was born in Chile No he doesn't know we are married He lives in the US now HIS NAME IS JOSE PEDRO BALMACEDA PASCAL AND I LOVE HIM And he's twice my age But that's ok ITS NOT A PRANK WE ARE IN LOBE He just doesn't know it yet Haha Rando question But if your parents were at the dinner table with Principal Jennings while he was tearing into the kids would they have said something I'm sure my dad would've My mom would try to distract everyone I guess by saying something like "WHAT A LOVELY MEAL" What would ur mom have said I mean he called MC a hoe My dad too but he's 5'4 so Lmao My mom would probably loudly change the subject Or if he called me a hoe, she'd throw hands for sure.

When my grandma died, I cried all day until I was exhausted and passed out. Suddenly I had a "dream?" I was flying out of my recliner (where I was napping) and then into the clouds. I heard this really old song playing and it sounded like it was playing on a really old radio or something. The clouds were pink, like pastel pink and I looked down to see my grandma but maybe 20 years younger. She was walking towards a man in a military uniform, he looked about 40 or 50. She was in a black dress with vibrant flowery print, it was really beautiful. They started to dance to the song, the man was pretty awkward and uncoordinated but they were having fun. I called out to grandma but she couldn't see me, it was just her and that man dancing. she was laughing so hard, I've never seen her so happy before. The song kept playing, I had no idea what the song was but they kept repeating the lyrics "at last...at last" Then suddenly I woke up and there were tears in my eyes but...happy tears?? I quickly googled the lyrics at this song came up https://open.spotify.com/track/4Hhv2vrOTy89HFRcjU3QOx?si=zfYRi2bnRzOXcSvwuly7aA I read the lyrics and I started fucking sobbing because I realized the man was my grandpa that I never got to meet (he died in his 50s) and I went to albums to look at his face and he looked exactly like he did in my "dream" He died around 3 decades ago and my grandma never moved on. she talked to him constantly while he was alive. And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh, yeah, yeah, and you smile, you smile
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last ^anyway yeah those were the lyrics to the song And idk if it was a dream or my mind cooked it up but I felt like my grandma was telling me she's happy now The end Sorry this was long No He was a soldier Anyway forgot this part of the story but remember the floral dress I mentioned? I ran into her room and guess what I saw sitting in her bed? Yeah I've never seen this dress before But it was there Yeah @DaHomieDrew my story up there if u wanna read ^^ SIMBA

Best case scenario you have ADHD and now you are equipped with the knowledge to help See a psychiatrist online Ask for a zoom meeting with one for consultation They should have one if you call up a hospital and ask for the number of a psychiatrist who does online meetings Yes but they will help It's like a regular doctors visit If it's to help you academically I think they'd definitely want to give it a shot I went from summer school in high school to deans Lister in university so it's worth a shot Aren't you about to finish college I think it's worth a try to see a psychiatrist first before you decide https://www.columbiaasia.com/indonesia/specialties/psychiatry

I haven't seen that yet, it's on my watch list https://www.idrlabs.com/anger/test.php Take this test bitches Let's see who can beat Viv Heyyyyy Hostile outlook is the highest Hostile Outlook
People who score high on hostile outlook view the world in a cynical, suspicious and mistrustful way. They have an easy time attributing ill intentions to others, and often assume that others are lying or do not have their best interests at heart. People who are characterized by a hostile outlook usually experience a wide range of anger cognitions, but not necessarily anger emotions. NXJDFHDOODF HIGHER THAN VIV WE HAVE A WINRAR u can be a little pikon drew :blatherspanic: pikon

Anger arousal denotes the frequency, magnitude and duration of a person‚Äôs angry responses. People who score high on anger arousal are quick to escalate from their normal state to the state of anger. Their anger usually has an affective charge, and they may experience their own anger and the bodily sensations that accompany it as overwhelming.

fire - shaolin kung fu/muay thai

The culture of the Water Tribes, as well as their location in the polar regions of the world, is primarily based on the real-life Arctic cultures such as the Inuit and Yupik. Its cultural elements also borrowed that of Chinese and East Asian tradition. Elements of their society also draw from many other indigenous cultures such as Native Americans and Pacific Islanders. **Earth Kingdom**
The architecture, clothing, and culture of the Earth Kingdom seem to be based primarily on China and its neighboring states. The many tribes and towns throughout the Earth Kingdom can also resemble other cultures **Fire Nation**
The culture of the Fire Nation is primarily inspired by East, South, and Southeast Asia. Some of its culture also draw inspiration from the Mesoamerican civilization. While its geography is drawn from volcanic islands including Iceland, Hawaii, and the Polynesian Islands. **Air Nomads**
The Air Nomads are based primarily on Tibetan and some Nepalese culture, the Shaolin Monks, and Sri Lankan Buddhism. Other influences are drawn from Hinduism - notably, the seven chakras. but if you were to choose, what kind of bender would u be i kinda love fire but i also like blood bending so :clown: i do see drew as earth zutara > O SHIT LAWS IS OUT :YEET: is it OH faces they rly gave the asian girl a white face huh guess im playin latina Hi, hi!

Those that live in the last two are termed nun√≤ sa puns√≥ (Tagalog for ‚Äúold man of the mound‚Äù). They are either categorized as good or evil depending on their color (white or black, respectively), and are often said to play with children (who are more capable than adults of seeing them). Offending a nun√≤ sa puns√≥ is taboo; people who step on them are believed to be cursed by the angered dwende within. Have any Viet ones? Oooo Owl ü¶â Yeah I've been cursed We cut down trees at home once and I've gotten unexplained fever or flu My grandma said she'd see me playing with an invisible child lmao I was like :catWTF: We do this too My mom's strict about it Hdkddkd do u not have superstitions I believe in it Nsjdjdkd DONT WANT THEM FOLLOWING YOU HOME But also in a mental health sense, it's nice to go somewhere else before going home Sort of like to drop the negative energy somewhere do u guys find that creepy I thought it was reasonable Lol Chinese ones r cool too We do lots of Chinese ones Long noodles
Chinese superstition doesn‚Äôt stop at the dinner table either. Ever eaten Chinese noodle and noticed every piece is as long as your arm? That is because the popular belief uncut noodles in soup will increase longevity. If noodles are cut it will ‚Äòcut the longevity‚Äô. ^ we serve noodles on birthdays Unlucky 4‚Äôs
On the flip side of Chinese superstition, the number four is considered to be unlucky and the number is avoided for vehicles and houses. The reason is that the number four in Chinese has the pronunciation that is similar to the word for ‚Äòdeath‚Äô.

He bought them a McMansion, multiple vacations a year, etc. What did he get in exchange? He got re-homed as if her [sic] were a freaking puppy!" the petition said Right They bought hella shit w the Huxley clout Apparently they'd give Huxley a separate room and they'd all lock him upstairs while the parents and biological kids had "family time" Wouldn't allow him to hang with the other biological kids too It's messed up Adoption is sacred imo It's accepting someone who isn't in your bloodline into your family and it requires a lot of trust and a lot of love Yeah for everyone but mostly the baby The thing is they're still uploading She has over 600k too And a new infant that she made herself Yeah they uploaded still after that rehome announcement Is the ace family still up Hiss They make the kids participate in fabricated plotlines n shit for clout My fam is applying to be a foster home üôè hoping we can give a little infant some love and a semblance of a family before she's adopted We'd rather she live here than in a crowded orphanage with a diaper rash and bronchitis We'll teach her to walk and talk and send her to preschool until her papers are ready for her to fly abroad to meet her forever fam Thank you ü•∫ It's gonna break our hearts when she leaves but it's gonna be worth it Lots of kids in orphanages suffer from developmental and social delays because theres a 10:1 kid to caretaker ratio So hopefully we can take care of 1 It's not a huuuge accomplishment imo since it's just one child but we want her to have all the attention Same I'm fine with || surrogates if the mom and dad have viable eggs and sperm but the mom has health problems || Like Kim and Kanye Some people can't wrap their heads around || caring for someone else's baby || In the Philippines, they choose babies that look like their parents so that they can adjust well. So if you've got curly hair or dark skin or brown eyes, they take that all into account. This is for local adoptions only ofc. Also you can't pick the child Cherrypicking children like puppies isn't allowed in the Philippines, you get matched by the social worker.

I actually got an autograph from Aleks Le !! I'm a huge Demon Slayer fan dhkdbfjd I mean ofc nobody can do it like the original japanese cast but I can appreciate the dub like its own entity. Plus, I'd watch it in both sub & dub anyway. And it's not like they got some random people off the street to do dub, Zach Aguilar and Abby Trott did work for Fire Emblem and Bryce Papenbrook is a veteran in the industry. ok that's it thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Where is Kyo REEEEE We had a scheduled appointment :catHideThePain: What u doing rn drew O shit He an independent boi My dog refused my cuddles today so I'm gonna mope around the house https://tenor.com/view/captain-holt-brooklyn-nine-99-how-dare-you-gif-12239747 I do like both. The original japanese version is great as well. Same thoughts. I got Aleks Le's autograph with a small Zenitsu print Yeah I hate when they try to westernize the original material But afaik they don't do that anymore I like that the dub even calls them Hashira instead of pillar :smiledoge: But yes the dub cast gets so much shit for no reason, usually when a gatekeeping weeb asks you sub or dub, you get shat on for saying dub. Like dub makes you less of a fan Hdkdhfjd Plus the most sacred dub of all, Ghost Stories. Like I've actually been to Japan and Akiba, dickhead. You're not a bigger degenerate weeb than me!!!!! Hdkdhdkdj EXACTLY god I hate gatekeepers In any fandom oh god same Never interact w the haikyuu fandom Gridbrje They're VERY weird bro At least the ones I've interacted with Has anyone been to both Disney and universal World is too big for my little legs Like HOW do people walk the entire park Disney World is 25000 acres Reeeee Kid Rae Is jacked Rae do u happen to know what time Kyo gets off work :mmochathink: Do u guys like universal studios more than Disney btw :catWTF: I feel like universal doesn't maintain their rides as much as Disney does but they do have a better ride system Like have y'all been on spiderman or Harry Potter?

IT LIVES BENEATH drew which dream did i tell u about cvghj ive had so many of those || stabby || ones oof yeah that happens :/ mustve been so upsetting i have ptsd so my sister says i scream in my sleep and then i laughed bc it reminded me of pimento in b99 ohhh by the fan? oh well i did have a dream that i was a hollywood actress and  there was a girl from the czech republic who claimed to be my biggest fan. she got extensive surgery to look exactly like me, even hired a vocal coach to get her voice exactly the same as mine. anyway in my dream, she came to my mansion in LA and she introduced herself, we were wearing the exact same thing and i was kinda creeped out so i was gonna close the door but she stopped it with her foot. she went "wait, can i be you? i can be your double and i'll attend all the events and movie premieres while you rest at home." and obv i was like NO wtf get out of my house and then she pulled out a || knife || and chased me round the house. my dad called 911 because we ended up locked in a room together and i was wrestling the || knife || out of her hands. the police got the door open and i was holding the knife, this bitch changes her tune and starts bawling claiming I WAS the stalker, not her. everyone believed her i was in disbelief. anyway i went to jail and i looked back at my house from the cop car and she was at the window creepily waving at me.

Blades of Light and Shadow, It Lives Series, High School Story, Open Heart, Foreign Affairs, Laws of Attraction, Big Sky Country, Endless Summer, Crown & Flame, Most Wanted, Hero There's also Nightbound, Perfect Match, Veil of Secrets, Heist: Monaco, Distant Shores, America's Most Eligible Pretty sure the genderlocked books are like pure romance ones Or motherhood ones I beg to differ, choices has been profiting off forced male love interests for years.  uwu M for Mini and W for Wumbo M is for Mara is my queen üëë M is for MOM WHY CAN'T I GET A PET FROG I PROMISE ILL TAKE CARE OF IT üê∏ WOOOO Fake?? A ?? Wat I don't think we should throw around heavy terms like this, choices is a game that is mostly played by women so that's why they have more books for women, that doesn't mean they hate men. I do wish they gave us more GOC books with varying body types and hair options And more race options ?? I'm Tim, the default forg pet in The Elementalists Mara no like ping Hot Ok I'm removing the incel troll Goodbye I hope you make contact with a living vagina soon He's gone now Goodbye üëã I hope he read this Anyway That was a weird experience Because women 100% of the time wants a breakup for just a tiny mistake

They fill it up with pasta. The end. Yes that's the magic tooth stuff No it's like a paste My teeth look great tho I have a killer smile because the pasta be bussin No My teeth have problems I lack a coating thing that makes it vulnerable to bacteria I also lack calcium So my teeth break and shatter Yeah I have lots of shattered teeth Sometimes when me and my dad eat, we pull out teeth lol.

Cause my other friend is like this and she doesn't have Asperger's Ok so my sister and I are polar opposites right? I'm extroverted, she's introverted. I like stuff that she may not like and vice versa. My sister gets special interests sometimes and they come in phases. Th phase rn is VTubers Idk if u know what those r Fucking AI streamers who are anime girls Idk tbh They're very loud and annoying Anyway I just give her space and whatever. It's not my cup of tea, but she likes it so that's fine. My sister is very insecure about her interests. Like VERY insecure. She gets defensive when you criticize her interests. It legitimately makes her upset. This is the concept I literally cannot grasp. Anyway she watches her vids whatever I don't care Which one And there's this 1 VTuber song I literally CANNOT stand I am fine with anything else but I literally cannot stand that one So I was like "can u not play that" And she went OFF Bitchass like "You think everything I watch is annoying it makes me not wanna watch in front of you" "it makes me feel like a loser with shit taste" Like.... HELLO??? I literally didn't say any of that I just said TURN IT OFF Well my exact words were: Can you mute that, you can literally play any other VTube song just not that one pls And she got mad Like.... :tlFrogKnife: But why ? :0  I mean it's hard for me to grasp. People like different things and that is ok She grew up an outcast ig because she was different Oh yea maybe :mmochathink: Oh but why does that matter? Sorry I don't mean to offend I just don't get that line of thinking. For me, it's like this is what I like and if you don't like it, that's fine. Sorry this was for @DaHomieDrew Well, she's always been like this about her interests :( For as long as I can remember OOOOOoh now that I think about it she was bullied for liking cartoons and anime in school You are a smart kyo Wow we did it *Dora dance* But I still don't get how people be like thar If people don't like what you like, that's ok.

At the very core of it, Pre-Cana is a way for couples to open a dialogue and discuss topics that need to be discussed before getting married: fiances, children, faith, career, etc. These may be topics that you have already discussed, but I think they're ones that couples try to avoid. It's not very romantic to sit down with your husband and decide who is going to balance the checkbook for the rest of your lives. But it's something that you need to decide because if you both hate knowing how much money is in your bank account, or if one of you just spends until you get an overdraft letter to stop you, that's something that can cause a conflict in your marriage. Pre-Cana starts that dialogue for you. (Catholic thingy you need to do before a wedding) also you have to always say YES to wanting to having kids or you dont pass lmao bc apparently god said go forth and multiply probs a filipino catholic thing because divorce is illegal here babytrapped for life i stopped after high school :AAAAAA: god i cant with filipino catholics guys r you old enough to remember all the hsm movies pls say yes' i know lu is bc 1997 gang yes hsm1-3 GHNM, NOOO i memorize all the songs from all the movies but im realizing a lot of people here are 2000s babies YES NOW jk Sharpay Evans supremacy EVERYONE SHAT ON ME FOR LIKING SHARPAY BUT SHE WAS THE TRUE HERO OF HSM @Angelaa angela knows all about my sharpay worship i saw her and thought holy shit, shes the baddest bitch ever and i will be that bad of a bitch one day H E Y :AAAAAA: same SHE HAD SEXUAL TENSION W GABRIELLA SHE MOST DEF DID in her I Want It All fantasy, gabriella was in a maid outfit... kinky DID U NOT SEE THIS SCENE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDINDrUSWJE WHERE DID U GET THIS zac and vanessa mustve had a rly traumatic breakup for them to not wanna be around each other at the 10th anniversary premiere think it was a rumor bc they dated for 5 yrs after in interviews though ashley tisdale said talking about that relationship was painful for the both of them and told the press to fuck off and to stop asking the cast members about it because they are friends with both people she has a baby now a new mom she released a new album which was p good game? :0 how does that work mo cap? ahhh like good ol rami ashley was also in a netflix show about lesbians christmas lesbians lit go ashley fun fact i named my childhood dog ashley bc i loved sharpay so much :DogsOfDiscord_2_Cheekss: drop ur fav hsm song now SAME yES https://open.spotify.com/track/3SMxd9vNy41n9Xk4UFw36S?si=ac67b6308c5344c7 this my fav fun fact they played can i have this dance at our prom fvbnm, YES im down rn but there are people watching sth :0 yes hi @CinnamonBun welcome!! :stitcheslick: Feel free to grab some #roles and a color at #color-role-channel :tlDogWeee: Wow going to do TRF now finally got through TRH3 Oh god, maybe he needs some xannies or something to calm down I'm so bored, anyone down for a movie? :babyyodasip: Hmm like What would u guys wanna watch :6419_frog_rotate: Frozen omg No hate to u but I literally hated that film Hdodhdk My sister loved it though What genres do u like b oh fae likes horror Have y'all seen Spirited Away Now that's a masterpiece I also loved Baby Driver but unfortunately Ansel Elgort is in it :0 do y'all wanna watch any of that Hmm I'd say spirited away doesn't have a main romance theme Baby driver kinda does Hmmmm I'm thinking of movies with minimal romance I FOUND A LIST On an ace site Dgiehdkehdk Spirited Away is on it Silence of the lambs (another one of my faves) Brave Early Harry Potter films but let's not give JK Rowling the views @Metta @Belbercike @DaHomieDrew thoughts?

Hnghhh I really wish they spread the releases out over the week I wonder how long until they start making the regular amount of books again I used to be excited as hell We used to have like 4 releases over the week or something The pandemi lovato really derailed their timeline apparently Well since the QB Q&A was done from home, I think they're all still working from home :pogfish: I just want more books Are they running out of ideas Let's send them a Google doc so they stop making awful books gdkshfkdf Oh god u have NO idea how many times I've spammed them about the zombie book With the It Lives/ES points system I think I was a freshman in college when I started e-mailing them about it They'd just say "thanks Viv we will pass it on to the team" :tlrFrogKnife: You better Hi Lu My queen SUSY BAKA Task force Karen I'm sure rae was 2 pounds right That's like a teacup chihuahua Jimmy neutron I was 4lbs What's the size of a normal Asian baby @Arzaylea Hdkehdkdbd That's very normal Why Oh yeah I forget you don't work in the maternity ward I just assume Lu works everywhere like a super nurse I was late Still 4lbs though They sent me an eviction notice Fun fact! For my sister's birth my mom's water broke at a movie theatre She was laughing so hard that it burst or whateva She still sat there and finished the movie because mommy is not wasteful She said "you better wait your turn I paid 10 dollars for this movie" My sister's umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck Lots of doctors say that's a big cause of autism and she does have Asperger's But she's very high-functioning so I'm not sure if that's a thing or just fake news Though all my friends w Asperger's were born with their umbilical cords around their necks! Weird coincidence Let's hear it :0 Radiation does affect sperm Oh unrelated but one of my favorite drag queens is a trans man. He was originally a woman who became a man but he dresses as a woman for work. It's great, I love how they fuck with gender. Aw man I'm sorry that they do that :/ that sucks Some people are ok with other people's lifestyles but they feel the need to control their children's Yeah exactly Lu Half ass support Oh Adam I meant to ask. If I do have a child that is trans and they want to take hormones and everything and do permanent changes to their body before puberty, is that ok? A lot of people say they should wait until the child is an adult like 18 or something Yeah idk I don't want my kid to face health problems but I don't want them to suffer in a body that isn't theirs That's my biggest worry tbh I have trans relatives so I just wanna be ready I actually learned a lot about the trans community through the drag community so I hope I'm getting the right info. But do some of them do facial surgery to look more masc/fem? What's a colon OH I thought you meant it as a slang term Hdiehdke Ok the actual colon I did see that! Someone had the top part of their head wrapped My fave drag queen who is a trans man (gottmik) got some jaw thingies? https://www.instagram.com/p/CMzvrEqAr1N/?utm_medium=copy_link They got the jaw implants I think I didn't know there were different types of top surgery I want booba reduction Which one r you getting You need someone to drive you home/to the hotel too Must be terrible to be misgendered My great-aunt (he wanted to be called this despite being trans ftm) changed his name to sound more masculine and we all referred to him by that Me? Yes Yeah that must feel absolutely terrible, that's why a lot of kids are suffering from clinical depression. They just want to be supported/acknowledged. :( Aw man I do hope Gen Z raises their kids to be better For sure, I know a lot of people my age who still live with their parents. It saves a ton of money. Preach Wot Asians would never Dhkshrj true Imagine having your boyfriend over and your mom busts in holding your granny panties and she's like "HEY  IS THIS CLEAN, DO I PUT THIS IN YOUR CLOSET" and u can't be mad because u technically live in their house. No boundaries with poc parents O noooo not a republican :angycat: SIR Yikes on bikes Remember those people on Tik Tok who are Christian and they roleplay being jailed because "liberals" What the actual fonk They roleplay being in jail because they believe in Jesus And are straight This pastor even made a Tik Tok telling Christians to stfu because white Christians have it good Thank you Adam OH wait I did have this one question although it's kind of controversial They do look painful Ok soooo I kinda asked a trans acquaintance about this, and they got mad at me soooo üòÖüòÖüòÖ @faede pls feel free to answer too I kinda want to hear from people who aren't cis Ok sooo there's this YouTuber named NikkiTutorials and she came out as trans Oh sorry I'll be quick! Ok so NikkiTutorials is ftm and they didn't tell their fianc√© until they were engaged (apparently)! So I'm just wondering, was it okay to do? Like she's a woman, definitely. But idk.... Idk my trans acquaintance told me I was transphobic for even asking. So I'm sorry if this is offensive I'm rly just clueless MTF My bad They got surgery and puberty blockers So they really passed But yeah I mean...should she have told him earlier? What if he wanted biological kids or something? What if he was transphobic? That kinda stuff Yeah exactly it was touchy for that acquaintance since she passes (until she opens her mouth) and she's been abandoned by dates after they hear her voice. Yeah I mean if it were me, I guess id be a little upset. Not because they "used to be male/female" but because I kind of expect total honesty in a relationship and if they didn't tell me id feel like they didn't trust me? Tho idk if that's selfish Yeah they fully transitioned in their teens And he met her after in her 20s? This is what she looks like Ohh stealth trans is a thing? :0 Interesting True Not all people have the stomach or desire to do it, I get easily upset with a lot of anti-lgbt topics so I am not a heavy activist It's tricky I'd date anyone tbh, I'm bi. I wouldn't mind adopting either. But I guess that's a deal breaker for some people and that's ok too. ah the big five So my sister is playing TRR I hate it here Sister: MC looks like she's trying to let out a silent fart 

Sister: *After Drake is introduced* This guy looks like he smelled my fart She should replace Kat Ebdkhrke "I read that as || cock ||" Sister: (About MC's smiling face) she looks like me when I accept gifts I don't want "Wow I'm a slut, im a tour guide to this bachelor party" I can't believe they let her type his name like that No like the weird capitalization lol Sukdeez and RaTpAtOoTiE forever "that's lame" I didn't catch it in video but 1.5 seconds later she said HARRYDIDYOUPUTYOURNAMEINTHEGOBLETOFFIRE She kissed the prince Man did you think I was the only chaotic one at home Man my sister is crazy Welcome to your trial Today you are here on five counts of public indecency and two counts of criminal trespassing How do you plead @Arzaylea you no longer have a color?

China is big money but he prioritized the human rights of his Chinese brothers and sisters over anything else. What a mad lad Indeed Oh yeah CCP also banned kpop Because of its depictions of "girly men" Hkehdkeje They implemented the ban after a BTS member's bday and their Chinese Facebook had so many posts about him Small pp energy Threatened by a Kpop man?

Therefore, if translated word-for-word, the phrase means "your mother that is a whore".[8]

However, most Tagalog speakers dispute this simplistic translation, instead alternately rendering the phrase as "son of a bitch"[9]¬†or as a variation of the word "fuck" Pakshet is just fuck shit in a filipino accent Look it came from American contact Hello drunk I'm dad :shijudge: i am going to bed later scrubs @kyo view my ig story this is a threat When is surrender again Hmmm I had tofu nuggets Who is this he's so cute Frogress Beautiful I had junk food today :-( Not my proudest moment :CuteWiggle: I've been so busy with the baby too Love him Oh damn that's great, the Grammys should nominate more diverse artists I need to pee so bad I CANT IM TOO LAZY :VIP: I'm the UTI queen Mood, my teachers never let me pee I WILL PISS ON THIS FLOOR LINDA Teachers found it disrespectful when I asked to go to the bathroom Weird as fuck One time I drank water from my thermos and got yelled at She was like "did I tell you that you could drink water in my class?!"

Spinal disorders and conditions are taken very seriously by the military. Many of the jobs have stringent physical demands and standards, and having any sort of back issue can be detrimental to your health, and the readiness of the force. However, according to the Tucson recruiting office, as a result of spinal curvature misalignment, your butt can be too big for you to serve. Enough said.

He's permanently smirking I'm looking thru them rn hmmm God I wish I had a good picture to show but I was too shy to ask for a picture dhkshdkejs Yeah I'm starting to wonder if he's a misc character or a minor antagonist No but tbh he can call me anytime Hsjdkdbksjsks jk lsjejjdhsksjdhekjs Hoe hoe hoe Oh well I'll see him one day The sprite I mean But like I could've SWORN The sprite had on a blue chef uniform Almost positive And like the chef uniform had blue lapels Or sth Collar Nope :(( sorry bud It's ok Maybe he was never meant to be found Sorry ray ughhhhhhhhhshsvdjjsjs wait ray dm @Metta METTA I NEED YOU YES Jesus Omg Why did I say chef Hdkehekeje I'm sorry Hsksjdkrje He's actually got queer best friends irl I think his ex became a lesbian and they're still tight He's an oral surgeon he specializes in TMJ BSKSBSKNSMNS Operates on jaws Dislocated jaws And the like Yes actually If your jaw makes a clicking noise he can reset it back He was supposed to do that for me today but he forgot Hskdjkejdksj Hrkejroejrjrj Bro that's the condition he works on You should have that looked at ANjskejeke NO üò≠üò≠üò≠ https://youtu.be/-iOzHoxsor4 I think I'm getting attached IM NOT IM JUST GETTING a lik A lil Yes IDK what's happening He's just so nice Nice to me What have I done Usually during Seggsytime HEJJEKDBEKSJ Nah he just says WELL he calls me babe and like texts me every day double texts or triple texts Calls me cute etc Not the same thing He adds on additional things Thanks uwu Always asks if I got home safe That kinda stuff :(((( aw ily THATS THE THING WE ONLY JUST MET But I'm getting infatuated We've known each other maybe 10 days He slid into Dem dms I mean we aren't dating Rule 1 was like No feelings AHhshdkejdkejs YET HERE I AM fuck No commitment And rule 3 is no matter what happens we stay friends Hdkehdksjdjdj WHAT HAVE I DONE Anyway today was extra sad for me so I lay on his chest while he rubbed my back and kissed my forehead and it was v nice NO JUST 1 we aren't committed And we are friends still I flirt with him a lot And he seems to reciprocate but I think he's just naturally flirty Like I said that he should introduce me to his doctor colleagues once I'm ready to get back into the dating pool again And he told me all his doctor friends were over forty And then I said okay I guess I'm settling for you And he said why not And then we both laughed But that's it Hmm I really like him as a person He's really caring and considerate and he puts himself before others LU HI Hskddhjs LU I have boy problems Help me momma We're just having fun tbh but we're getting to know each other too Yeah! He says he always wants to cheer me up Because he thinks I'm a good person Idk The thing is we aren't dating :(((( We're friends w benefits and I'm stupid and I got kinda infatuated Hdkshdksjdknsjsjdk LU Ok so he and I both got out of loooong ass relationships so we don't wanna be in another one rn but also at the same time we rly enjoy each other's company so idkkkkkk Hmmm yeah he's 33 so he can't be that dumb HEUSJSJDJ Yeah I need to figure out whether I have genuine feelings or if these are residual Jax feelings huh TLDR: Viv and Jax r split up, Viv meets 33 year old surgeon who recently split from his fiance of 9 years, they are now fwb, Viv is clown because she said she wouldn't get attached but then now she's sorta getting attached What's the diff between companionship and rebounding She didn't like that he was friends with his ex who is lesbian ??? She's weird Well that's the thing!! I like him because he is the opposite of Jax ü•∫ He's great in his own way Nah she always hated her So he helps out addicts in his spare time and visits rehab centers, he's really really forgiving like, someone stole his package and he shrugged it off and said that the person probably needed it more than he did He's into valo lmaoooo Self explanatory He's not afraid to get into stuff that are traditionally seen as dorky and kiddie because it makes him happy, he really really loves his mom and he pushes himself everyday to impress her. He's actually one of the youngest consulting doctors on the field. Hmmm When I was sad about Jax he let me lie down in his bed and he hugged me and made funny voices until I was okay He's REAAAAAAAAAAAAALLY good in bed hsjsjksjdks WHAT SHE TOLD ME TO NAME THINGS I LIKED Ooh Hmmm Well he's charismatic and funny and is super chivalrous. He loves kids and is a super feminist thanks to being raised by a single mom. He's super organized, smart and graduated early. He takes really good care of his friends and people he cares about. He's passionate about his hobbies. (That's all I could gather in 10 days) but tbh I will shop around I've given myself 1 year to be single And if I still like him after 1 year maybe I'll ask him out WHAT But older men r so cooool And good in bed Hsksdjksks But tbh if they're looking for someone younger it's kind of a weewoo ü•∫ Yeah I'll give it a year Before jumping into anything Thanks guys I love yew I'm gonna go doctor shopping Tf Man yeah gotta be careful with older guys too huh He's 33 so 1989 WHAT But they're so hot Gdkdhdjdjd His hours are soooo shit tho God He's bailed on me a lot because idk he had to pick up someone else's shift for god knows why Mmmmm That's sad We do have limited time together He barely sleeps and I worry for him God I notice healthcare professionals live really unhealthy lives no offense like y'all don't sleep And he doesnt have time for homecooked food so everything is instant He also vapes lmao bro???? Ur a doctor Sorry what's a code :0 He says his colleagues are literal chainsmokers He thinks he's healthy for vaping Yeah I heard Wait Lu what's a code sorry Oh no :( Jeez idk if I can stomach that tbh Jesus I would probably cry from the stress Damn you deserve this vacation I can imagine some people have to be restrained too When I was in the ER in the US, I saw a person splash hot coffee on a male nurse and he didn't even flinch. Police asked him if he wanted to press charges and the guy just looked so dead inside he just said "nah" That shit was so wild to me That's a good idea tbh WTFDDDDBEDJDJD What the fuck is that shit I've only seen monkeys at the zoo do that shit Man healthcare is hard I thought he was making up excuses about picking up people's shifts Is that fr Doctors do that shit??
