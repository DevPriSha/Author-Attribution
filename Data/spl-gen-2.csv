What I'm gathering from the storefront update is that there should be some new categories(?)/visual tags(?) on certain books.

**Editor's Pick**
* BOLAS
**Español**
* TRR1 (Spanish version, duh)
**F or M** (nothing yet)
**Popular**
* BaBu1
* BaBu2
* OH2
* TRR2
* TRR3
* TRH1
* TRH2
* TRH3
**LGBTQ+** (nothing yet)
**Mature** (Ages 17+ tag also removed)
* QB
* TNA
* WN
**Top 10**
* AME1
* BB1
* DD1
* HSS1
* OH1
* TF1
* TRR1
**Trending**
* MTFL

3. One of the LIs is a villian that you know from the start is a villian.
4. IDK about the setting, I just want a story where you can actually be a villain. You can go for the good LI(s), or the bad LI(s), and MC can even betray them at the end. Imagine romancing the villain then having an option to kill them/turn them in bwcause morals won over. Or *actually* joining the dark side at the end and leaving the good LI. Or being bad/good consistantly. ""Morality"" options actually matter. And this is why it'd probably better be a standalone because building and managing these relationship dynamics and MC's morals might be too much and even conflicting with the plot over 3 books, IDK.","","👏 (2),⭐ (2)"

Also, who you end up with in BB has absolutely nothing to do with the ILY. It depends on your closest LI. You could choose Kamilah as the closest, never once pick a romantic option (and BTW picking just one already means you're romancing them because it's jsut a true/false value and you'll get the extra dialogues everywhere), then tell it to Lily and Adrian and end up with Jax just because you take that one last scene (if he ||survives|| that is). And it also doesn't matter if you kiss someone when you decline the last scene.
Not all fragments -> no scene.
All fragments, no diamond scene, no kiss ->  closest LI (~~because fuck aces, yes I'm salty even though I romanced Kamilah, and no, I don't believe BB was that romance-focused if you didn't CHOOSE so~~).

You flip through the books, which feature a variety of colorful characters, stopping on one in the middle...

It's kind of creepy looking.

Kids ain't scared of much. This was my favorite when I first learned to read.

You sure you won't get scared?
Not when I've got you here to protect me.
{His} arms tighten around you, and {he} gives you a soft smile.
It's a book about the different creatures that live in the woods. Trees that come to life, shadows that can follow you home.
I used to imagine what I would do if I ever met one of the monsters I'd read about.
Nothing creepy about that.
Maybe it was. I found it a relaxing way to escape though...

It's no longer TE and it's a long answer so I'll just do it here. (Which still may not be the approriate channel because I still don't know how they work. xd)

It's not in the files in the APK. Well, some of the assets are (scripts never tho).
They are on a server and the app likely makes ""calls"" to the server and downloads the script and whatever assets it needs for it whenever a chapter is launched. Or when you view a book if we're talking cover art.
But if you know the URL/path to the file, you can make the same ""call"" in a browser if you just type it in. And that is how you can see assets/scripts prematurely.

The ""script"" (or more like a binary protocol buffer that contains data on the script, assets, closet, etc in the chapter) has several parts
* it starts with description (sometimes estimated read and title too), version if there are more (e.g. when they correct a typo it's gonna be v2 of the chapter)
* assets that appear in the chapter linked with path and an in-game filename (these are the assets that will be downloaded if you start the chapter in the app)
* assets linked the same way but those that may only appear in future chapters (these won't be downloaded with said chapter)
* a part where it assigns the handle names to the portraits that will appear in-game
* some lines that seem to be the general settings, closet, loading MC and other customizable faces, pronouns, etc
* the actual script itself
* the ""name"" of the diamond scenes with their costs
* a part where they assign the names and descriptions to assets that will appear in the closet including potential cost and the chalter they're (first) offered in (that is how we know all diamond outfits when the first chapter is out)
* a part where you can see the individual closet sections and in what order they'll be there, also the sprite order in the ""tutorials"" for MC selection","",""

Even Dave and Sam’s tragic backstories helped build up their personalities which I’m perfectly fine with.

You want to get advice from someone you frown upon to take a gap year? Anyways, my dad gives my number and calls me to inform that my uncle or cousin would call me seeking guidance, just a heads up. And my uncle and aunt are the type of people who'd stalk other kids on social media while their kids write poems on heartbreak and betrayal. So, I sort of scolded my dad because I know once they have my number, they'd think it's free real estate and call/message me anytime for the silliest of things. There's a reason I tend to stay away from them. And on call, my dad said he's sorry and he won't give my number without my permission. I thought he understood.

- “don’t talk if you don’t read” is valid. I don’t see it as a way to stop conversations, but we can all agree people like to just be super negative and share that negativity as in facts.  

What I think people mean by this is to give the book a shot, wasn’t for you? Cool. Share why without being disrespectful. Going to just diamond mind? Cool, share if there’s anything that made it a little interesting. Constant hate is just exhausting for everyone.  

- “cancelled books are cancelled, so move on” can be expressed better. For me, I think it’s the comparison’s that are annoying. I know others agree. We get it, you liked those books and wanted to have a series out of them- I enjoyed some of them myself but I won’t just go around and say “we got TNA9 but only 1 DS” cause it’s not fair to those who liked both or either.   

We can be upset because of the lost potentials but also support PB for making hard decisions. Writers don’t want their books to be a standalone, but they gotta do what is best for them, and we can be sad it came to that and continue giving feedback through their surveys and on the monthly newsletter when they ask what genre we want to see next, tell them! Vote! you prob will get it, even if you have to wait a while.","","⭐ (6)"
"607327540893188144","Arzaylea#9943","01-Dec-21 08:55 AM","- “sex sells, etc” is not a shield but fact. Society decided sexy is all the way in. Books on these topics will be on shelves, magazines with covers on how to spice it up will be sold, blah blah blah.  

I have three thoughts on this:
 1) Sexy books is not for everyone. You know what you’re tolerant of, you know what you like, so if you know that Surrender/TNA/Witness is not going to be something you enjoy, that’s so fine. Ridiculing the book because of the mature themes is not. I don’t see someone discussing BOLAS saying “wow this is for nerds, can’t believe you fantasy lovers think this is amazing” but there’s people who will speak on the more hyper-sexual books on how disgusting they are, how horny people are ruining the app- or the dreaded “fb moms.” It’s a bad look. So this goes back to my first point, don’t go out of you way to be extra negative. Stay away from the book if it’s not for you or if you want to give it a shot, go ahead. If you learn then why it’s not good, just say why. There’s always a better way to express yourself that doesn’t have to put down others.  

2) The sexy books being of lesser quality talk is just frustrating. If someone wanted to read about meeting someone and boning them in the next scene that follows, they can go to other apps which provide it quick and easy. PB does a pretty good job at fleshing out emotions, building up relationships and then the scenes itself (we all can name some disastrous moments so we can all agree they can do soooooo much better). Just cause it has sex in more chapters doesn’t mean it’s lesser quality because it’s just not easy writing a good sex scene.","","⭐ (6)"
"607327540893188144","Arzaylea#9943","01-Dec-21 08:55 AM","3) I’ve said this before and I’ll just share it again… I don’t get how some people like sex scenes in SW, TRR series, BOLAS, PM or QB but then think PB is going down the drain with recent books that just have more sex scenes. The books still have a plot, whether you think it’s a good one or not is up to debate, but sex has been around since day one. Some books didn’t have it, which is great, but we literally got to hookup in most of the OG books so why is there a problem with more sex scenes now? Just say it’s the book you don’t like and leave the sex out of it. Say that you want to see more of *blank* and leave out the part of I want less of *blank*.","","this (4),⭐ (7)"
