Hey y'all yee a little overwhelmed by the amount of people who joined my server but we'll figure it out ? we just wish to coexist as a place for people to vent about characters and stories and such @Metta bro you're the one who suggested the name yes it is @MaralinaSakura thanks for posting the server in the old spoilerland Because we can’t comment in announcement @𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙚𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠 you are precious and I will continue kicking assess for you @𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙚𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠 of course but I will step in if you need someone Protector of those who need it Ooooooof i'm tired but i don't want to sleep also yes Quinn , Charlie, Nia, and Sonia are baby this is what happens when you gotta get up at 7 she deserved better i do like that they gave Charlie and Edward more proportionate screen time Oliver got left out though it's good for once the white blonde male LI wasn't forced considering the track record ya i honestly liked Edward but my male MC's heart belonged to Charlie it was somewhat hetero based on my MC but bisexual right here Quinn Kelly is amazing Sonia Alves is a badass Nia is a precious bean Imogen deserved better parents also @MaralinaSakura if you want to be french about the rules about the BaBU2 suffering reviews, the technical words are "Les Règles" that sounds more fun if you enjoy a book where  pregnancy is the center yet the character remains bump-less the whole book My flair is solely based on books being released Though If I changed that Quinn, bianca, and Sonia would forever be on mine I get videos of TikTok in my Instagram search feed and a lot of the time young teens are doing very inappropriate dances in them and I’m just wondering why TikTok exists.

You know what, as an atheist, an anti christ propoganda wouldn’t change my views Also it’s insane It’s like at this point Whatever to the adverse side effects (non-body harm wise anyways) I just wanna be free from this bullshit There’s either been an increase in NSFW posts lately (on the Reddit) Or they’re showing up now that I’ve confirmed I’m 18+ On the Reddit Not here It’s uncomfortable Even with the NSFW People’s titles are just ... I think it blurs it for me too but Or is at least small I usually check choices Reddit on my phone Ooh that will flex Help I don’t use the app But I’ll look Thanks for the assist @𝙁𝙞𝙧𝙚𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠 I just set it to blur i hate that they're going for mature crowds especially when the stories have little plot my friend told me he stopped playing TNA and i was like thank goodness teens shouldn 't play smut on choices knowing or not QB is OK they fucked with Zoey and I'm still pissed especially when people use that as an opportunity to trash Zoey i miss 2018 choices i thought 2020 would be better than 2019 with choices but it's been stupid pregnancy story blades dream OH fuckery Wetness The stupid Nanny Mean Girls/Gossip Girl ripoff and MTFL only two of which have been okay thus far blades was amazing queen b is oka my two forced hetero romances mind you i still plan to romance the bad boy because Noah has some flavor but' ava romancers deserve all the love technically Sonia, Quinn, etc are more likable than Noah for me but ranks decently in LI's yea that person who got banned from this server like a week ago was a staunch mason fan no worries hayley and she left a huge ass rant about mason in the MTFL channel on Choices After Dark and some other shit complaining about the channels because they "Favored" an LI blatantly said they disliked Sonia on the Sonia appreciation channel for shits and giggles, then edited to look good @Rayvenrock the messages should still be on CAD they ended up leaving but we were monitoring and gave them a warning should be one of the first few messages on the MTFL channel and the third message on TH:M also in general if it hasn't been deleted sincde they left i'll send you an invite i'm the admin/owner of hte server sent it to both of y'all Cate?

I liked make Alex and female Taylor It was a French dude Yeah Yea That was so weird I do like that they started their own record label Though it seems a bit unrealistic Ryland I was like It’s not Raleigh OMG YES Like Replace the red with white And it’s literally Roland Ryland I think so It was randomized when you choose both male and female I’ve had female Alex when I wanted male Female Ryland Yeah to the 13 year old thing The premium stories are all kinda crap Except for the episode originals up til like prom night Ink was good I used Jules Hair Constantly Until limelight I don’t even remember Yea I think end of season 2 Season 3 is the successful record label thing I think I play it only for quality stories that still exist from users Yup I married Alex People wanted Ryland to be redeemed Yup Also PTF isn’t playable anymore Update info Yup Also PLL and Clueless There was supposed to be a clueless sequel Yup There’s actually a parody story Which combines all three art styles “Pregnant by my twin’s high school student gang leader father” I think it’s called The Dolan twins actually like did a playthrough of the one for him Fun fact I never finished the Cameron Dallas story They probably didn’t have the resources for accuracy with limelight Ink * I love the hairstyles but the weird thing with paywalling some and not others was wack Paywalling meaning that they including some of the best in only premium or only regular True They should mesh all the hairstyles into one template A regular user actually developed lipstick colors for Ink that worked with darker skin tones She’s cool Andrea Elle is really good used that shift escape trick to mark all my servers as read i don't think it's been that way like ever This new font is just wrong I miss the all caps 🥺 It feels those edits Judgemental aunts are sucky Im tired of hearing how much fairer I look since they last saw me or how much weight I’ve lost One time my great aunt told me I’m looking healthy Which is Indian speak for gaining weight Hostels are a really good solution for that independence factor Though I think dorm life versus hostel life is different Priya is a queen for a reason They’re cool I miss my dorm Though my roomie wasn’t the greatest I mean she was nice but she had her bf over all the time And her bf is mildly annoying But he was a nice guy Today is a great day to stan Queen Firework very true today we honor the Queen Firework i as well Life update I unpacked two boxes Of No Dorm room stuff My friend had to pack it for me as I don’t live in the state And she was initially going to keep it in her house until I came up for fall quarter But then I couldn’t So she shipped it all last Wednesday i don't know why i haven't done this before but i'm listening to the freaky friday broadway soundtrack i've heard the 2018 movie soundtrack enough times in my disney playlist as expected, the broadway soundtrack is much better but also similar singing even though only one actress, the mom character, returns this is ridonculous My biggest regrets on CLub penguin Not tipping the iceberg Not getting all the puffles Not getting to be fire water and ice ninja Idk what the acronym can also imply but good choice I think I know which Sad that the beautiful club penguin acronym can now be associated negatively yeah i realized that i didn;t want to bring it up further thanks forgiving me that reminder though that definitely sounded very wrong out of contextr i remember sharing my password with my friend i changed it literally as soon as i got home though I did Tbf I was 8 Hi gals, gents, and everyone in between/none of the above!

Oh Jassi? you can do  a thing to check your browser history or what episode you're like partially through oofles kk signing off now conference is starting!!!! I posted a pretty straight forward complaint about the last OH2 chapter on the book club post Lot of likes Made me wonder if any of y’all were likers I was going to have a chicken bake My mom made omelette Not when there’s veggies (Like spinach? Idk) And pieces of eggshell It was overpowering No real ifes Idea But felt like too much They’re aight But they are SO BLAND ... I don’t eat fish Personal I know it’s a bit ironic because I eat pretty much a whole lot other meat But it just feels morally wrong to eat something like fish, that every fish I don’t eat is a fish that doesn’t die I have liked the taste of fish when I’ve had it but I actively choose not to eat it Are you pesketarian? Because I don’t think that refraining from fish means being vegan... Ok J’espère... I genuinely don’t understand the point of capes in choices outfits Like the dress is so beautiful already (or butt ugly) And you throw in a cape He’s a clone But has white hair Still confused me i wonder if their chapter update posts are programmed to be posted the second the last chapter of the day is released Oof Lack of literally ANY INFO about the UMB So I’m guessing BD and MM in November The other two books in December That’s usually how it works Whatever this book was isn’t releasing this year The one in later this year (Last month’s) To hate Another vip book which is supernatural Baby Dump 2 being likely in November I think the political and mystery will be the same It’s a shitty time Go queen firework Getting tests done It’s good I’m tired I wish I could go back to when I was in junior year of hs, new to choices Literally everything was well done and so novel just annoyed at the lack of *anything* jackie deserves better MC isn't a therapist OH1 had an actual storyline there i've cooled down now i expected a solidification of storyline but there's the Ethan's mom thing, Jackie's panacea issues, Panacea, the broke storyline, and Esme's situation Yasss Trying this thing where I snark on episode stories for inconsistency/poor writing This one story has the WOC/POC as the creeps/antagonists And Caucasian characters as the protagonists (The episode paid stories) My brother’s hot friend I’m only playing it because I have unlimited reads for the next five hours on that story Plus gonna get so many gems The user made stories are damn good tho I’ve found some authors who write quality content Only story I’ve seen so far with accuracy in the pronouns. Only one pronoun issue and that was on a free choice Nvm there were two back to back Now So did the wife just not have a bump at all, or was she one of the cases where you have little to no bump until you near the end I think that the polls are based on what they’ve already written (since books are planned out and written up to a year in advance) and they use the results to gauge when the books should be released. YES As a baker I’d love that One of my favorite things about baking is that I’ve done so much of it that I can talk about the technicalities at length Cali squad should meet up and have a baking session Yessssss That would honestly be really fun Me and spirits will be captains You can have Metta on your team I’m like 90% I’d argue with him about spoilerland rankings I’ll bring my baking equipment You want to be on a team that’s focused or a team of banter Because I get *competitive* Jaz, Bee, Yunqi, Black Scepter, y’all gotta choose your sides No firework wants to judge All Cali squad members must compete Unless we can fly out firework out here it would be hard for her to take your spot I’m not 21 so this ain’t happening You can have cider and soda and hot Cheetos There will be corruption involved I guarantee it That’s a bad trope A homophobe realizing they’re gay after actively ||assaulting|| or bullying the other gay character Idk But if it happens that way It’s just a bad trope Homophobic politicians are pretty vocal about their agenda If y’all are into The Good Place, I’m doing a fic on AO3 combining the characters from one of my favorite shows and TGP I said I’d stop writing fics for the other show but inspiration struck Spoiler alert: ||everyone is dead|| I will! Yes We’ll do a zoom call when the Cali squad gets together I want a woman head chef She should be the “forced LI” We need a woman forced LI Yea A non GOC forced female LI any forced LI thats GOC is written as male usually Ya Remember the Paolo fiasco I just realized there are multiple Paulo’s Paulo’s The one who’s from TNA Who was a sexist pig and asked Sam if they agreed even if they were female Adam we absolutely have to have a baking discussion I’m thinking of making red velvet cake soon This cake had ganache Thanks’ ! The trick is to put about 1 3/4 cup to a pound (2 cups) of semi sweet chocolate in a bowl Bowl^ Then heat up about a cup or so of heavy cream until it’s about boiling Pour it over the chocolate, wait for it to fully set in (about 10 mins) Then whisk it together Then leave it at room temp but covered for two hours Hope it helps! You don’t necessarily have to hand whisk muffins, they can be done with a stand mixer, but fold in ingredients once the dry and wet are mixed together When you realize most of your mood swing behavior yesterday can be explained by hardcore PMSing :/ it was worse because I didn't get mine last month so when it gets late like this I usually cramp I straight up split a croissant in half filled up half with a good number of semisweet chocolate chips inside and warmed it so i had a make your own chocolate croissant it was good the calories actually help because they burn off in the period apparently the need to eat a bunch of calories is from that also chocolate is a godsend Sloane QUEEN i love those adorkable queens It is relatively toxic Best way to deal with rejection? Be prepared for any possible outcome I will be using TGP replacements for curse words until I don’t feel like it Im planning on making one Louisa may Alcott Spinster = lesbian confirmed woah we went from casual users to me being a mod interesting times ya time isn't behaving linearly these days wooooooo :Dopeysurprised: Can we get a boba munchlax Is it the 1001 thing Oh it’s the antithesis? Being gay makes it okay Doesn’t matter If it’s ugly :niapanic: Well If a server is new and has only one message This technically wouldn’t be false Changed my Instagram icon I will be keeping my icon as this as long as I can Mhm Something that helps, reacting with emojis as a separate comment I’ve decided that for the next book, I’m going to choose my LI on personality and not appearance Unless the personalities are interchangeable, then I’m going on appearance Ya, I think so Mara I forgot which book was up next lol We Stan cats in this server And your cat pic is so cute thealia! Nice I’m guessing the outdated phone is safer to download it on because it’s not being used for anything current Hey Drew, pls spoiler tag your comment, some of those things aren’t things people should be reading if it triggers them The use of that emoji and Mara’s frog emoji is always a tone it down or else feeling Yikes Who the fork is that guy Ah RP or another I saved the picture Mara It’s not the emote Woah Dead with 100+ people It’s like CAD which is quite dead with 40 Hold up what’s JEE Ahh :Dopeysurprised: Oops Sorry y’all Ahh Yay Double threat triple :Dopeyhappy: Okay that’s the last one y’all But it was fun You could block him theoretically Oof.... That boy seems the type to straight up make a server and invite you just to ask his qs Yeah That is not the way to get someone’s attention How the Tho* Merci beaucoup mon ami LOL You pictured me as Bianca? You’re also the epitome of chaos Happy lesbian day’ !! One of my college friends has to read the communist manifesto for her class (reminded me of spirits linking it in their last TRR script :Dopeysad:) but she’s also planning on finishing reading the story I sent her So I told her, and I can’t believe I ever would say this To go finish the communist manifesto Frogs Bartie So people associate me with Kiara I see Also we should move the bot talk to choices land GO MARA GO PRIYA WE STAN Dankeeee Lmao this haha soon ya i remember being excited about it I want Seattle to be the location of the next book Mushrooms are strangely good Chocolate tres leches! someone with an understanding of proving predicate statements pls help me Go UK!

It accidentally ended when I sent this But North America oof I’ve realized that even if I like a fic author, if I try to get more interested in their works, there’s always a pattern and it’s tiresome at a point Like there’s this Harry Potter fic author who’s had this one story I liked but reading the rest of her works I noticed that in each story Hermione behaves stupidly, Harry calls her out for it extremely coldly, they get married, and Ron’s written as trash I get his character traits weren’t great but he was still a good person Yayyyyy!! Danke Mira HQ, North America, Two Imposters, Code: ZSICQQ come join~ coolio! awesome if you know anyone else who plays share the code info pls thx! yikes someone's a creep i was trying to see if i can ban the|| toe sucker|| metta you playing? that was creepy and mildly uncomfortable well they left now coca leef i'm glad i used my discord name lol in the greenhouse lime green cyan sus damnit i thought they were i think it's blue YAS we won yeah i was pissed i can't believe people voted you out or that i was sus I lost my temper eventually at Chez Glad that person left That’s actually unfun Hide and seek Among us is more fun Like They thought because they said so That’s what was going to happen Do you know any of the members who played initially I made it clear though That if they wanted to play HAS, switch servers Ah Do they go by the same name in those servers Ah I mean in the servers on discord Ah I hope I didn’t offend any of them It was frustrating to see people try to take control of my game Ah If cyan left because I said it and not because they were pushing the HaS thing It’s chill Whoever chez was got on my last nerve I can’t type fast on my phone So it was hard to defend myself Blue was a dick And they weren’t even an imposter I saw you with me but no one believed you Why’d they keep blaming you if they weren’t?

Using Voice Chat/#no-mic-chat Metta you didn't play last time @( ˶ᵔ༝ᵔ˶) milquetoast ♡ down to play? awesome head over to #🔇no-mic-chat i'll create one for whatever reason my flair on the sub has Benji (Gag) and sick Raf and idk why holy crap that's sick someone changed Zoey's flair sprite to Benji i put a post on the sub about it like wtf but why *Zoey* yea but Gaius is Gaius Benji is traumatic okay so apparently the QB sprites are all Benji but still traumatic I deleted it i went on Fb for the first time in a few hours and this is the first thing i see holy crap Whoever says that next will have to stream an episode on VC aw :/ why are you like this i permit you all to temporarily spam to get that off the screen kaleen don't post that again pls i'm going to remove it for the sanctity of my peace of mind and arachnophobes i'd say spoilertag but it's a bit too creepy perhaps it would've been more appropriate...October 31 They actually don’t do much story wise Still cute tho whoever's down for a game of Among Us, the code and server is in no-mic-chat Huh Wack Oh it’s still Friday insiders is out y'all ooh the political book is foreign affairs and the supernatural book is wolf bride ...and that's literally everything they apparently said it was a GOC story ...it doesn't sound like one i hope the political one is, though Random thought -> they didn't mention the return of MTFL Best thing to wake up to Pennsylvania thanks for believing in the guy born there! Just a random thought Do you guys think that playing freemium games where you don't spend actual money (hence having to decide on when to spend the currencies you get for free versus save up) helps when making spending decisions in real life situations? anyone who understands C++ pls help I’m trying to implement a BFS it's fine What is the most memorable MC name you've chosen, and why? (Did it mean something that fit the theme of the book, did another character have the same name, did it mean something to you) One of my old play files of choices - Aurora (NB), Arden (PTR), Apolla DuBaer (TE), Andromeda Pendragon (RCD), Andi (AME), Arina (ACOR), Amelia Renaldi (TRR), Alana (BP), Amara Miller (D&D), Anna Percy (OH), Araminta (ROE) I had a whole A theme That's really cool Arzaylea! Yeah i tried to stick with a name scheme for the siblings, but kept Violet, the Aunt, and the LI's names the same So for the A names: Amanda (Jess), Araminta (Katie), Aramis (Alex), Aramet (Nicole), Aracelli (Violet) ooh nice If I had a relatable Indian MC, I’d name her that way Yea trh is up and edited I just saw a choices ad that uses a weird face But is literally TNA finally getting butter in stick form instead of those pound cube things will make measuring it out much easier have there been any book descriptions uploaded ya that came out on wednesday ugh great is RT's next chapter going to be heavy I’ve been getting some really sexist ads lately for games Like this woman who is a bit disheveled asks a guy out And he’s like “are you kidding?” And shows her this “more attractive” woman So she decides that “I will change myself” And then it’s a makeover Ok this one started with that And with no explanation Transitioned into house renovating Lol so apparently that dude is the ex that cheated on her in the game If the black haired guy is in the ad he’s a loyal one Yeah cuz I think that guy is the LI Their artwork in the actual game is nice Yay! Li hairs can be wayyyy better than the mc’s So I’d be chill Also with reused diamond hair There were so many good hairstyles in TF and TRR, Reuse them PB Not this far city Where Like the message Starboard must be down Yea I’m down Yes Aight Lmk Among us is being mean and I’m not able to join rn 🥺 It keeps disconnecting me from the server Is it just me, or is PB overcompensating for the insane diamond scene amount in witness By being barebones with diamond scenes in chapters as of late Like there’s an outfit and a diamond scene That’s all Also TRH recently I still don’t understand why Pb thought it was a good idea to put another book on Friday Like it’s just Wednesday and Friday in the schedule now Why It’s got at least 4 more chapters 5* It was 2018 was the age of experimenting where they had books almost daily They shouldve It was already cursed Pls don’t star messages that talk about NSFW content like ||porn|| Also Arzaylea please spoilertag Underage server members shouldnt see that stuff in normal channels What? Yes That’s what I meant When I think I’ve gotten the message right and I forget the apostrophe 🤦‍♀️ Thanks! The day an Indian character had my name I will screenshot it And keep it to myself My dad’s name has been used for a character before Which is...weird Ooh?? For what book Not really Cool beans Yea I didn’t want to ask you what your name was so I asked you the series Since there’s *quite* a few names in each book in choices Unless your name was in witness because there’s like 7 characters Omg I feel bad for choices players named Cassian Amelia is also the name of both I think the nana And violet’s daughter in ROE Drew you also share a name with Andy Kang Sort Sorta Omg as long as you don’t share a name with Cody from ILITW That guy was a creep That everyone thought his sprite was reused for Garrett for whatever reason See you got a good association too So there appears to be a TRR-esque episode story It’s called faking mr. right Even has the body up art style of TRR and choices in general I’m reading it for the diamonds I’ll let y’all know how bad it is But they talk about competition Royalty Marriage And the country is called Ruscovia I named her Olivia Nevrakis lol We’re heading to Vegas for her best friend’s wedding And her friend who’s getting married is Violet and the other is Rachel OMFG SHE LIVES IN NH NY* Remind y’all of someplace? Thanks! The Princess is “Leona” I think it’s Leon if you choose to date men I’ll find it out when they mess up the pronouns/name for a diamond choice anyway She’s even blonde like white Liam omg She’s got an arranged marriage proposal for Princess Fiona Ok I love this outfit I don’t think this is wedding appropriate... Why they’re pushing this blue I’m Olivia Nevrakis, My hair is as red as the blood of the people I slay I date girls why is my ex a boy It’s not her house, it’s the cage Surprised this wasn’t a diamond choice Cafe I’m ducking into women in this story bitch stop pushing Brody So this is the prince Literally named Mhm I’m love reacting Lives We’re seeing how alike this is to TRR I’m into both I replayed just to see what the name of the prince is set to But my main game is Princess named Leona For whatever reason no matter your sexuality you dated a guy named Brody for a while We stan this grammatical errors Character named Ash... hmmm In a bachelorette party In Vegas.... This is wayyy too short One of the Princess’ men Also I’m really annoyed that the LI’s friends are solely men regardless of story Feels like the Statue of Liberty They really enjoy this marrying a random stranger in chapter 1 in Vegas trope Episode wtf Yet again Getting married BEFORE revealing royal status First time I agree with the free choice Run out of there b 5 so far 12 in total I bet This is “Princess Fiona” Nah I’m still reading RT’s chapter lol But the descriptions are interesting I stan the milkshakes Yeah I’m not working on either of those til next week I’ve got finals to worry about rn Thanks!! Thanks! 100% He rules Wait why did you spoiler tag coffee Mara jumped in quickly to get something so the bot was  triggered for some reason That moment when this blog post is more informative than the insiders email... Is that your MC’s name? It’s like they were trying to find a compromise And failed I guess it makes sense that they changed it to accommodate the accents but still be the uppercase format Maybe coding limits? I’m thinking of like USUM In Pokémon where they pushed the 3DS to the absolute limit PROFESSOR SWAN? YOU THERE PROFESSOR SWAN? She really wants you to know she got that PhD I wonder how much Pendergast tuition is I feel like this is a question that should have been answered Especially when MC transferred Since hartfeld is a pretty costly school Beat the elite 4 + champion! Yes! I spent a couple of hours grinding today Then said screw it and went in Pretty much handled the entire Elite four + Champ with feralligatr And used other mons as cannon fodder for healing So the rest of that TRR-esque story is out ...I chose a female At l least the kids are actual siblings in game Who’s cevin Sprite wise Dm me this link Made my first mostly cooked dessert! Included pudding from scratch Will send pics tmrw! Why are we jingling bel It’s jingle *bells* So I wanted to make a joke that also perfectly captures the situation Wanna more positive second server, come to CAD First server is of course spoilerland ...bel I didn’t even realize you changed the name OMG apparently Lindsay from STD She’s Bengali The last name sounded familiar and someone on the sub was like Bengali rep! So I doublechecked and Basu -> Bipasha Basu No one really talks about that I love Lindsay So @Metta came to the realization today that you can get married at your wedding in AME3 i think it's actually something you can apply to real life even irl you can get married at your wedding Idk why but I thought it was from a different ethnicity entirely I basically was pronouncing it differently in my head Oof Totodile ftw Metta world peace So Brendan in Emerald is just as dickheaded as Blue and silver And he is MAJORLY softened in ORAS for example After you beat flannery in Oras He offers to go with you to Petalburg In Emerald He mentions Norman And says (and I quote” Unlike you, {May}, your dad looks like he’s really tough I do believe with all my heart That red and blue are boyfriends And by SM/USUM they’re husbands honeymooning on alola So i finally read through the billionaire bachelors for the gems on episode And they kept referring to the black card option (if you reject the bachelor at the end) And because the LIs propose and you choose between them I wondered if we were actually gonna get that option We end up doing so in the last chapter And I took the black card option Especially since I’d never interacted with the guy as an LI until he was thrown in at the end But I disliked the one I’d paired up with for most of the story (Black card is the unlimited credit card, you get to spend the billionaire’s money) Honestly just be like I’mma head out https://tenor.com/view/ight-imma-head-out-spongebob-imma-head-out-ima-head-out-gif-14902967 I remember there used to be a channel where you’d be “muted’ And you couldn’t access anything until you apologized for your behavior So I’m guessing it’s like If you did something really bad? Im guessing it’s accessed only by admins And muted role It’s interesting They’re probably practicing their mock trial skills Maybe just to be more dramatic The three strike system is valid unless they pull some bad shit Yea Lu don’t do it But if they figure out it’s you Also silent lurkers They could spill I can assure y’all that we don’t have one here If there’s any issues we contact through DM Yet some of ‘em badmouthed us there Witness mc wouldn’t be worth Redfield’s time, lbh Hartfeld is the least problematic TE in VOS Duffy would’ve been found out in five minutes thanks to Atlas Sufficient distraction Plus, Max would definitely be attracted to all the OH LIs Maxwell and raf would be a bad pairing Baz and Max, though... Maddie and June We’re spitting better ideas Than 90% of choices books this year Guys we should totally create spoilerland crossovers Where we create stories together Based on choices Without the graphic art probably Unless someone’s willing to be the artist Like a graphic novel Or a choose your own adventure book à la Club Penguin That was epic The crossovers at the end of th:m Hero 😢 Soniaaaaaaa She truly is My Soniya Iykyk If you had to choose between sending Landry or Ansel to jail Who would you choose I’m glad he was written out after the softball game HIGH DRIVE RIGHT FIELD IT IS RIGHT AT DR. LANDRY OLSEN’S FACE Seriously hearing kruk/kuip announce homers is the BEST And declan Also Jon Miller I didn’t cuz diamond spending If it’s been a year+ It’s okay I would take another book of TRH If we got all the characters together I would pay PB Because *collarbones* Okay So out of all of you Who owns A Leather jacket I got one and it looks good with everything My dress jacket goes well with everything Including my kung fu clothes We were gonna go up to SF but then our traveling car had engine issues I have I had crappy period times And my dad got a whole ass box of the sandwiches I was dying from cramps during online tutoring If you’re ever in Newark Go to samrat Amazing chicken In California We’ve established my cali squad status I don’t live there https://tenor.com/view/cool-b99-brooklyn-nine-nine-andy-samberg-detective-jake-peralta-gif-11062927 It was fun img Omg Move to San Leandro I think they weren’t able to continue it because of Pb Someone got pissy about the big deal that was made over his leave 9k4 ES is popular with those people I’m living it through AME ES was completely unique Hero made them look like real people in a more cartoon style Quinn’s CG during handfasting 🥺 The gambles of old PB 🥺 Lmao this guy is flossing Lbh I would 100% be down for Bryce lahela Still got two hours! I will host a VC party every so often where people can jam out to holiday songs Sing as off-key to “all I want for Christmas is you” as you want AND I Don’t want a lot for Christmas Anyone who wants to sing all I want for Christmas is you Go join VC On Friday Anytime Friday really As long as it’s after 11 AM PST Why would I ever wake up at 8 AM On purpose I wake up at 8 AM Randomly Awww So in the Cali squad We have an accountant A CS major/aspiring author Student Please continue On Drew, Yunqi. Black scepter We can probably pull off being qualified to join PB At least convince them to make an internship position I need summer internship Gotta have a job qualification Metta can work the numbers Are you a uni student What’s your interest geared towards I’m sure Metta’s numbers prowess can help get PB out of a financial low Ooh cool! You’ll make the animals in the stories incorporated well And treated well by story plot Jazz can help bring the young aspect to Choices Where high schoolers actually act their age Lu will rewrite OH3 Ok I Know this isn’t the way it actually is But OH gives me the impression that all regular doctors like MC, Jackie, sienna, etc do is diagnose and pass them off to specific professionals But that’s also really just because they’re residents But that’s quite literally how they’re written in the book I have an uncle who’s a doctor and I know he does more than that I do think that OH should’ve written them better To respect the medical professionals that have been saving the world Also I’m curious as to the major differences between clinic doctors (like the PAMF doctors) And hospital doctors Palo alto medical foundation It’s where I have my physicals and other checkups It’s not a hospital that’s for sure It’s mainly for pediatric and physician appointments And they have radiology and a lab Also a surgical center I have heart wants what it wants in my head rn Idk Ooh All the books which share MC sprites with LH and HFTH Cole and Max would definitely date for a hot second Hana would be nudged out of her shell by Serena Who would end up with Olivia, having such headstrong personalities Horatio is more like Max I think in quirkiness But Cole is better suited Ben and Liam Drake and Mark Metta, Pri, and I are kind of doing a three way versus of Pokemon fire red that Pri and I randomized And I’ve been naming Pokémon after choices characters Pri’s been naming characters after discord peeps Bee, Jess, Bel, you’re all mons in pri’s game Yee Metta took a day off And Pri and I both hit the end-ish of the game Individually I won! You are articuno So...this happened Not sure, Pri mentioned in passing but hasn’t clarified There’s certain phrases in English writing that get me annoyed when reading them “Slips into a smirk” “Dips <food> into <some runny food or drink>• Person clucks It’s like a Mark of disapproval or something? It just leaves a sour taste in my mouth I don’t normally buy the premium hairs but it was CUTE It’s just a sensory thing I actually really love Miranda’s hair and I’m mad that MC doesn’t get that option The rockstar’s manager is trash LMAO THEY didn’t set it right These stories always involve such an asshole reporter Also her name, Lisa Sleeter is an obvious parody on Rita Skeeter It’s the Christmas premium story Just came out today All I want for Christmas Thanks 😊 I haven’t made them in so long Do it! Metta has a valid post on Reddit Go check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/k5nu7u/charlie_thompson_our_favorite_little_sister/ one of the comments is my favorite All the pro-Charlie peeps are hitting up your post metta...did they take down your post I don’t see it in the regular feed Wait I see it Lu we’re twins I think that it was originally a competition between Metta and I for the better nickname Disaster bi’s get disaster bi’s only No discrimination against disaster gays And apparently I’m not disaster https://aminoapps.com/c/choicesamino/page/blog/blades-of-light-and-shadow-quiz/1JXE_Bkoi6uYdEv28JlBE8Jg2XBGQ2GLoW Metta no spam Lol it was me who sent the Blades quiz Just quick thing, please turn off mentions if replying to me, thank you! It’s okay! It will show the blue @ on, just press it to turn it off I know you’re joking but that’s a lil rude We do gentle reminders in this server household I’m the server’s young, little bit naggy, mom Nah you’re the cousin who’s a little bit new but has got the spirit of it all You’re the...disaster gay uncle that everyone calls uncle despite not being related? Metta’s the grandpa Nah he’s just old Always reminiscing  about the good old days When the limos you went to prom in had CD players Will occasionally yell RIP KOBE in the middle of a family dinner I swear Half the time Metta heads offline He comes back to me roasting him Nah I ain’t putting that much effort in If it’s not a paid job Lu was If someone pays for my VIP subscription I will provide quality commentary Those things feel very sus I like the layout tbh I genuinely missed the books being full thumbnails and not that little dogeared thing OOH As THE BP COVER IS NOW THE SAME The RCD logo is...meh They’re all weirdly larger Is he not allowed to be Hispanic and have blue eyes? The difference in OH background colors is pretty prominent The white in book 2 is much whiter Just as the book got whiter with the Ethan forced romancing I know that Middle Eastern people can be blue eyed (thinking of Leila from A Thousand Splendid Suns) and though not sure about blue eyes but there’s several green eyed Indians Random effing change I paid 19 DIAMONDS FOR NICE HAIR And it gets changed to THIS BS Apparently in the original, free story it also changed because of bugs so it BETTER be fixed Fun fact, i saw the same sweater in dash and Lilly I feel like they just use the bitchiest dialogue to get people to pay diamonds Bel thanks for the updates! Sorry I’m on a hair tirade Episode They really want us to live the tired ass barista outfit life Finally my hair is back This is the one episode premium story these days with no closet options That you can actually change your hair Wonder if they thought they could get away With using charli d’amelio Ugh Really annoyed that every chapter starts with the free hairstyle I *love* the beehive bun, I do, but this is just BS Unless it’s one of those stories they’re testing and will rerelease later on It is Beehive is my style tho I really hated this “best friend” Honestly predicted this She sounds like JENNINGS LMAO I’m just gonna imagine her as Jim Jennings We’re supposed to pay diamonds to wear it Otherwise she wears it One diamond outfit I’m NOT buying Girl get you and your ugly ass eyebrows away from me Right now 5 chapters But they go up to 12 Right? You know, i really want Episode to have ONE story where the gf that ends up being broken up with is a sweetie pie That ends up being like a best friend Rather than a bitch Don’t gaslight, bitch None of these LIs are conventionally interesting Basically a Christmas story where your now rockstar ex comes back to your small town to shoot a documentary That’s all I get from this Idek It’ll probably be behind a diamond scene I won’t pay for Also She trying to fight her gf I just want ONE Episode premium GOC story Where the female version of the LI Isn’t only best friends with men Like the male Hmm now I wanna know which it was This is this story’s version of the ROD sweater outfit I *think* it was a story focused on the woman LI or something Right Sounds like the kissing booth Toxic story The second movie featured an LI that is cast aside but is a much better option for the MC Honestly I’d rather date a coffee shop owner than an actress Who would want to live in the spotlight all the time ? Here’s the plot twist That will lead to the LI throwing a benefit concert To save the coffee shop That is *literally* the plot of Christmas in the Smokies Who cares if libraries are tiny No they were just repeating the rude comment made by the camera guy in their head apparently this random dress from three years ago was still in the shop on Main Street Finally, non-barista outfit i think so Ew But WOA I actually love the TRR cover The ads are all smutty So I feel like they’re drawing in those attracted by the ads I’m so glad that HSS and Hollywood U ended before they could turn them into this Though they make MC look like Belle from Beauty and the Beast Remember when PB kinda redeemed itself for 2019 with a bunch of Christmas books last year Ya’ !

We had originally planned to launch it this year, but due to stretched resources and the prioritization of our team members' health, we made the decision to release this mysterious book in 2021. But don’t take it from us... take it from Andrew, the Book Lead!

“I’ve loved working on mystery Books for Choices since the days of Most Wanted, and I think fans of the genre are going to love this one. In Crimes of Passion, a truly terrifying serial killer stalks New York City, and it’ll take a pair of very unlikely partners to bring him down! You can expect spooky thrills, exciting action, plenty of crime scene investigation, and that special wonderful blend of snarky slow-burn that you only get with two partners bickering over a crime scene.” - Andrew this sounds like MW but with more romance FUCK Blades of Light and Shadow, Book 2: As Blades Book Lead Andrew mentioned in our Blades Q&A, you meet new villains, explore fantastic locations, gain new skills... and even add some new members to your party! Because of the large amount of resources Blades requires, we estimate it won't be released until 2022. It'll be a quest worth waiting for, so as always, thank you for your support. New books in the works: While we’ve had to push back some of our 2020 books, the good news is, that just means an even fuller, more exciting slate for next year! We’ve already teased the book about solving crimes... but how about a Book where you argue them in court? In this brand new title, you’ll compete for status in one of New York’s most high-end law firms, navigating controversial cases, outwitting scheming rivals... and discovering just how steamy the laws of attraction can really be!

As a special holiday treat, we’ll also mention one other Book we’re working on... one that falls in one of our most-requested genres ever. Let’s just say it involves making tough choices for a rugged group of survivors... in a world where the dead have begun to rise!

And finally, because many people have asked: we will have multiple books where you’ll be able to select your gender. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE BOOKS WE WANT like hero the stuff they talk about sounds promising TBH the mystery book sounds like crimes of passion is MW2 but they're actually incorporating romance ya it's likely not going to be COP = MW2 but it legit sounds like MW2 the plot is basically MW it's not fair btw their end of the year blogpost was literally content-less like who cares about the year in review we want to get info closure it is, if they promote literally only that at the start TF has the most reads in general though their acting like they're the ones in privileg like we've been begging them for good content GOC full fleshed LIs lack of smut this year has been PB's smuttiest year they have no right to act this uppity we're so cool for giving 2 female LIs to 3 male LIs instead of a 1 to 3 ration ratio FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS ONE you can choose their pronouns i wonder if any of PB's employees uses a fake account to pretend to be a fb mom and they say shit like fb moms tend to say to see how many people agree i legitimately don't put anything past them considering how much more conservative the reddit has gotten i feel like Pb sent some of the fb moms the link to the reddit page told them to go ham i made jokes about the whole UMB remaining a mystery and voila metta got me my most upvotes AND my first gold thanks chaos ~~It was also his meme~~ he ran out of posts allowed so I posted it remember that one guy who was adamant about Bertrand being innocent and talked shit about Maxwell i legit didn't even prep for the ACT essay and i got an 8 which...was out of 12 but still no :MunchlaxMunch: i want to see this now he should just play every savannah diamond scene but he hates her?

Wait... Babe WELCOME BACK, SPIRITS!! spirits is the one who created the Cali Squad group chat y'all it's fabulous for Spirits to be back but please do not spam emotes :CharmanderHi: Is perfectly acceptable as a reaction to their message or ya know, a regular "welcome!" it may take a few minutes for starboard to pop it up carlbot's doing his best I’m being mommed by my family friend’s parent cuz I’m heading back to college no she's telling me all the ayurvedic stuff Yesss that’s awesome Adam! Yay!!! Enjoy all the diamond scenes 😀 Np My friend, ladies and gentleman No it’s apparently a trailer for some game called doom eternal It’s a demon through the protagonist’s eyes Idk but that’s probably contingent on if you saved the game on an account If you don’t buy the premium outfit in MM Go check #🤝mismatch no you literally show up in your undies So considering PB decided to make three books with canon connections to the choices-verse movies in this chapter, let’s dive in. I believe that MTFL, with pretty much no references to older books other than in movies, exists in a parallel universe to the rest of choices. Now here’s the point of contention. Bachelorette Party features Hero as a comic book (or am I think of RCD?) But hero coexists with Endless Summer Endless Summer exists in the same universe as TF series, which ties back to everything Including TE, which also ties to BP with Ryder’s character Thus, BP exists in a separate universe from both the main choices verse and the MTFL universe, where a Hartfeld and Pendergast does exist but never had the storylines associated with TE and TF But were popular enough to have a series made of characters who graduated from the place (TF, VOS) And every parallel universe in choices means that the central plots exist as movies, tv shows, comics, and books Which means there’s a universe where TC&TF actually happened, resulting in a modern day cordonia where magic is all over the place and they don’t rely on balls and apples for peace. Thank you for attending my Ted Talk. So literally nothing in January if you had VIP I’m guessing kyra’s just not gonna be part of the story We’re gonna have fifteen over the top references to the fact that Aurora is being friendzoned  by Pb every chapter It’s good, it’s just every player that had VIP knows how the story goes So with MTFL ending The only stories we’re gonna have until feb are BABU and Foreign affairs I’m not discouraging you aw hmm i wonder what the word finale mean s it might have something to do with "the final book in the series" not sure though ~~also me and metta decided to fill out the subreddit mod application~~ which means that if by some lightning striking a person or a person winning the lottery that one of us gets it we're gonna have to not shit talk the subreddit ~~Not that we'd disallow talking about its mess on SPL anyway~~ me and lu would be the new chaotic mods we cut down the 500 posts saying the same thing all the posts that shit talk an innocent person we will kick ass and take names exactment i wanted to see the best defenders on SPL go off on reddit also when people talk about the lack of LGBTQ+ rep or the way JBH tends to culturally appropriate books for it to not be downvoted to hell and not back i mean there's a lot of stuff to be done but yeah we'd let the Bartie memes in It’s actually kinda cute WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY i'm reading all the first chapters it's so fun without paying for diamond choices Cuteeeeeeeeee Paige you’re too server baby for tats Mhhhhm Damn dude Wait you’re her crush or she’s your crush Good To Know Weird The only person who I’ll make fun of for his pierced ears is my cousin who did it within like the first month of college My cousin ain’t it He’s flannel bbq boy No that’s from Pitch perfect https://tenor.com/view/pitch-perfect-rebel-wilson-fat-amy-lesbi-honest-gif-4754285 Aight So I’ve cancelled my subscription to vip Still shows me vip keys It’s been almost a day since it was supposed to expire Aww damn 🥺 I’ve read most of them y'all did that fast also Emi still have the whole VIP shenanigan Rip my vip yup ... are you on the book club channel?? :hmm: Though great when I ask her to watch Masterchef at 11 pm PST, not so much when it actually means she can’t sleep Make sure there’s a woman LI tho Make it password protected or something Or some way to keep fb moms out So I looked up what Ossetra caviar was in google for hero And I got this ad today I mean I guess since my Gmail is connected on my laptop it makes sense All of our ultra fans have a higher color role Lu you’re an editor now So you will flex as well Weirddddddddd I might have to fix it https://www.buzzfeed.com/lov3lylea/how-well-do-you-know-the-choices-books-and-charact-5wxxqgm6m1 Already spotted something wrong MC’s dad in D&D isn’t from Grovershire Mc is Brie Larson be trending on Twitter because on a video she said that what she’d be doing at 10 years old is looking up how to know if you’re gay on Twitter is peak energy It was a question someone sent in Y’all Bradshaw and Isabella’s last name is Achilles And they’re pretty much undefeated except for one thing Lyra and Isaac Their *Achilles heel* whoever wants to listen to the HSS OG song join jukebox Me, getting ready to meet my bro so he can drop off my shampoo, goes down around the time he should arrive to find out he’s been in his hotel in the phone with his rental car place the whole time At least I got some breakfast from the student center I gues Congrats Lu! Regardless of how you do, you showed them how fabulous you are We did We were all in shock that nia lost i still remember how chaotic the choices sub and servers got after that chapter was released I’m in class still 😢 Metta you’re a mod so you’re supposed to be that guy and and it’s fine They can talk about it without free forming on spoilers like without the tags Ooh thank goodness https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/kzbvet/2020_rchoices_community_survey_results_2_of_4_lis/ Inchresting ...mods are wack Sometimes There’s a difference between a redeemable LI and a person who’s given hookup scenes but is a shitty person all around who’s family issues justify nothing There are characters who deserved a redemption arc but never got one There are characters who deserved a redemption arc and got one There are characters who didnt deserve a redemption arc and got one And then there’s poppy min-nakamura Savannah’s backstory was hushed and hyped so much that her running away because she got pregnant was a cop-out If she’d just told Bertrand she was pregnant I get that Savannah was young then Though she acts like she’s 45 And dresses like it too She has some damn nice dresses But they refuse to let her wear them She at least got to wear dresses that aren’t her pink outfit Her in AVSP deserved better than Bryce I only accept the head canon that if you don’t marry Liam or drake drake and Liam marry Yeah we could’ve Especially when both Olivia and Hana could have the surrogacy storyline Though in trh the LIs are pretty one dimensional He’s a break dancing sex machine Tbf they’re all into sex Drake becomes Christian grey in the last diamond scene of TRH3 They should’ve had him on a cover Isn’t aerin dead They made a post for what happened with drew but they stayed quiet when the moms went apeshit God the fact that Lin Phaan whatever decided to directly call you out in her story (The spoilers woman) I was disgusted Caution: contains 90% heteronormativity with a shoved in female LI at the end so we can say there’s “representation” That woman is into all the Caucasian males Including the forced LIs “Take that (insert Drew’s name), you big bully ✊” Exact quote^ Right? She’s obsessed with some actor named Marco Linfan Or Nathan One of the two I tried to be neutral about her but then she decided to be that way As long as you don’t bash any characters that aren’t antagonists Well that entire category of discrimination is the worst you can be So you hate people who fear spiders? (Arachnophobe) We say stupid shit but we got each other’s backs That’s what spoilerland is (Stupid shit in good humor not as in shitty opinions) humor is loved METTA WE HAD THE SAME THOUGHT think alike i remember reading this one fic writer who amongst other things i've noticed as problematic, had the characters get indian food for the hell of it (i think they order up food like you can eat it individually instead of it being family meals) and just the way she kept writing on echaracter one i was like No also this other writer for the same fandom who's writing is *intensely* problematic cultural appropriation some other shit i don't even want to talk about even with spoiler tags and there's like 50+ works for the fandom but they're all basically the exact same content wise i called her out once on the cultural appropriation and she muted me this being one author Wait there’s an Indian Cassian? I need a sprite pic The male sprite doesn’t really look Indian but I can see why the female one is marked as such God I’m guilty of choosing Hispanic sprites the most I avoid using white sprites unless I think they’re the best drawn If there’s an Indian MC I choose her no question Off the top of my head Caleb, Zekei, Raf, James, Katherine, And Jackie (MM) may be the only black LIs I’ve picked Oh and Zoey They also make even POC LIs whiter if they’re in the cover Remember when both Robin and Sofia were whitewashed in the CH CG Wait no The other one With the tied up hair y'all i need two spell names 1 to restore items to a perfectly functional state and another to restore perfect orderliness I don't want to look up anything latin I came up with a couple, it’s all good I’m not entirely sure Her name is ambiguous and her last name ain’t a thug. Thing I hated that she’s the only one who’s not given a last name Damn I thought me, lu and Metta were the best I thought you said seductively and I was like wait what Man it really started with Meta Bias is shit Especially if they don’t prove their bias worthy Uh I fight people on the choices sub too No Your last comment was also 39 days ago Hi!

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is its vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin, vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently voracious violation of vivition. The only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.

The proper way to take a tequila shot: lick the salt, take the shot, suck on the lime
how to enjoy an alcoholic drink on fire: extinguish the flame with your hand first
the only drinks to ever be drunk: Champagne, Sparkling wine, Sparkling/Apple cider, sparkling water, _whiskey_, mint julep
how to enjoy yourself apparently anywhere: play the "life story" game how could i forget the drink only second tier to whiskey? woe be'est me! i'm being dramatic what the actual fuck pb needs to stop idolizing white/white passing characters while treating POCs like shit in stories OH is one of the *most* diverse casts in the entire game but they throw away *all* of that when making the story center around *one* caucasian character who isn't a bad person but is wayy too forced it's almost like PB forgets that not everyone wants him yeah but they've portrayed multiple storylines involving POC women being treated like the enemy with one white boy who should 've left the story after the softball games i wasn't arguing for or against, just adding another general issue maybe it's not about the POC thing but they specifically choose to make it be especially since it makes 0 sense for harper to be on the diagnostic team you make good points btw 😄 i *wish* there was concrete proof that it isn't racially motivated but a lot of characters done dirty have been POC, namely Black, as of late and female and harper *loves* being a surgeon i admire her willingly choosing to give up a position of power to do what she loves and it makes *no sense* for her to change it metta it's fine yup but her sole goal simply seems to be diagnostics here well surgical seems to be a full time position i don't think you can just do surgeries "on the sides" caseloads are different from surgery it's why there's a whole extra year of residency for surgical residents you're going to have the scheduled surgeries and then you're going to have the emergency ones often times long, may need follow ups, never a set thing i once had a scheduled surgery meant to be for 45 minuts minutes it went on for 3 hours+ these things are unpredictable they did the same shit with zoey kiara even june...kinda they said we sidelined this character for an entire book let's throw her back in coulda given her a mentor role with Bryce but *no* her only storyline in book 2 was showing aurora that she's more than just her niece tbf, sidetracking is me within five mins of doing anything but its abnormal in a high stakes environment Good thing it’s still day in Merica they really love making whiskey the go to drink mark my words, i will find out just how worthy a whiskey is when i turn 21 those are definitely reasons to have this is that...lance from pokemon yayyyy https://tenor.com/view/captain-america-i-understood-that-reference-look-back-gif-14556485 wait what's the bar name ? in OH\ you had a...campus...bar? i like the virgin version of a strawberry margarita it's essentially a strawberry slushie the closest thing we havve to a college bar is kombucha on tap at our Bistro you become a decent drink at that place/ ? your pre-edit message LMAO Ethan Ramsay definitely went to UCI probably not i think so the residents in OH went to the Ivy's fun fact, Ivy is actually a signification of the athletic division it belongs to Like the nighthawks and stingrays Like bruh The Yankees and Red Sox exist You already used Giants and Rockies But if they wanted to really use a rivalry to make sense of the Wearing the rival shirt, you use giants playing the Dodgers me, not liking potatoes those are the only ones i tolerate fries confuse yeah but they had them as professional teams maybe? there seemed to be a crowd yeah but they were yankee/sox ugly rivalry how 'bout dem apples? cordonia's national motto oof stay safe you got this oh god tik tok the choices fandoms:

Oh nooooo I fully made up this one for a story so if they use this name they’re stealing my property This made me realize how many Asian female LIs are pale skinned which is honestly sad Like some of the only non-fair skinned Asian LIs are Ayna, Teja, and Shreya, who are all Indian Basically, unless they’re Indian, PB has a tendency to make all their Asian LIs extremely pale Yeah? Her last name is Desai Teja is short for Tejaswini, which is also Indian Mumbai has mafias? Still ^ idk really anything about the underground world An Ah Interesting This is true Ava M is top left In the screenshot Still pretty pale tho Hana is I think the only one I can think of who’s non-Indian and not fairer skinned, but she’s also mixed race Is Hana’s mom Asian?

    The zombie book is officially titled Wake the Dead.

    you're looking to test your skills at a different profession, try
    Laws of Attraction! It's been almost a year since we made our representation post which included goals for what we at Pixelberry are striving to achieve. A lot has changed in that time. Later this month, keep an eye out for our blog post detailing what our studio has been working on since then.

Party Mode TWENTY-ONE @Metta I had tequila for my first drink 💜💜💜 Thanks!! It was pretty good I’m gonna have a Jell-O shot in a bit I’ve already had half a pina colada and some beer But like a few hours ago Yes I’ve been sipping on water for like ten mins Fosho Back at my place I’m gonna eat some leftover fries and drink more water Thanks y’all 💜💜 thanks!! i can't read marathi but i knew exactly what it said Lol Thank you! Hi thank you It’s still my birthday Thanks queens I’ve officially gotten drunk drunk Thanks to queer/bar Where I saw a drag show And a straight person got kicked out, hit a security person, and kicked the door hard enough to shatter if yeah we were far enough away from the action but we like checked up on the security guards and all it was a wild night but honestly that queer bar was freaking excellent thanks 😄 Love when men are condescending aholes So I ran for President for the club I was vp for this year Lost to the guy with NO leadership experience, who was trained by the president from last year And that guy made the club leetcode focused, which made it hella boring And I wanted to bring back social elements to the club with my presidency Bc I had literally no say as vp this year I have ss of this convo I had with the president But he was being a condescending ass Honestly feels rigged The presidents this year were also trained by last year’s pres The pres last year basically ran the club this year it's ok the club is just flawed af the female oriented version is a lot better because its welcoming to everyone i'm already in the other one it's more of an org than a club though it's way more casual but i like it that way 🙂 not really? my club doesn't exactly have an advisor and no one cares enough thanks adam 😄 i've just got one more year and i don't need to participate in my old club anyways (it's the CS Club at my school for more context) yeah i basically said my truth and he's shut up since:
Pres:
Also as vp you could've still gave your thoughts and advice to the president and still had the same effect
me — Today at 7:38 PM
but honestly i feel like i never had any real duties as VP this year and i just don't want a repeat of that didn't want to send ss because that would dox him more from the original context:
Pres
Yeah so he applied originally and then took himself off the ballet, but I told him because (new pres) was the only one that applied for VP he would get it if you declined
You declined so I offered it to him because he was on the ballot originally and would have automatically won if he kept it on
me — Today at 7:34 PM
no i get that, i just assumed it would be whoever ran for secretary that would get VP because they were actually voted for
pres — Today at 7:34 PM
Secretary is a different position then VP
If they wanted VP they should've applied because they would've gotten it lol
(new VP) was just iffy on it because he thought he would be busy but I talked to him about it and he changed his mind
but honestly I thought you were gonna take VP ^keep in mind this man knows i already was VP this year Basically the new vp was not on the ballot when voting i miss having the energy to do that i sleep at midnight nowadays Congrats Mara! Me https://tenor.com/view/violet-willy-wanka-gif-5139605 Me every time I hear verruca Oof Oof Lu’s just built different https://tenor.com/view/tea-and-biscuits-gif-24227124 Ayo I wish we had brand name places Our school is catered by this company called Chartwells and their food is ass What are food options like at uni’s over there We have a “grill” named after our mascot Worlds worst chicken tenders Naurrrr y'all chill with the botspam #🤖bots-and-pets-uwu s'il vous plaît @Metta kio's calling for you I feel like I’ve seen zomato do that before somewhere It’s representative of pri’s love for Olivia, from her head zo-ma-toes That pun did not work .ud Zomato https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zomato The company I’m interning for is also a unicorn Basically a private startup with over $1 billion I only work for gay companies, obviously #🎥media-not-related-to-choices Hot cocoa 💜💜 My favorite drink Happy birthday @faede!

I honestly thought that’s what it stood for lmao But it sounded so regular They lied probs Thank goodness Still hate that it exists It would be so cool if it was MW2 Since it’s focused on cult and murders Throwback to when Hero 2 was coming in 2020 🥺 Can we come to PB and give them some help with the art Or how they managed a similar art style for ES for THREE BOOKS Yup Fuck romance This was the first week where I paid no diamonds None I’m nearly at 200 now Congrats cool kids ! :furballhappy: You are Already upvoted you I am *hyped* for your MTFL review I did the threesome that was fun though short i can't believe it was part of the s*ck n' bl*w scene, without an extra amount of diamonds not really *ever* done in choices Benji should stay the FORK out of QB They should have included a more specific warning for the chapter He is a traumatic character And shouldn’t step *foot* into book 2 No Fork is TGP’s filter replacement for Fuck So no No spoken Spoon Pb needs to forking stop Mhm ? Damn Also don’t ping Mara, she’ll see it On her own I don’t think so but the person notified would appreciate that you took the time to rectify it. A server I’m in notifies everyone for every stream, and it’s quite annoying to see that mention notification Daily Just let them know that you had pinged them but didn’t realize that it can be an issue Life 2.0 was good because of the casual friends with benefits thing Story got confusing though I guess after everything with Demi they took it down Mhm technically it was EA before PB separated, but yes
I actually wish EA kept those apps on the store i think the company, Mansingh Transglobal (Which is in ROE and ES) originated from COD right Owen was a cool dude Woah I just saw this, you still playing? Ok I won’t be able to message tho other than in the game Just to lyk Crap same code right Pri Black got me Like wtf Y’all couldn’t have waited for me WAIT FOR ME WHEN YOU’RE DONE WITH THIS GAME Yunqi lmk when the game ends I can’t because I’m unable to simultaneously use discord and play Yunqi can you Use Europe and 2 imposters And then let us know the code 10 And sells Skeld* Me too, I just sleep Yee Pri stop killing me next time Yeah that’s what I said in announcements If sounds like though that it’s ||one sided because apparently the dude was told to just stand there with no reaction and the guy who confessed is going to hell|| yesterday definitely seemed *very* eventful yet it all happened last night it has to have been in the original times for it to be a classic or at least have been out for two years i'd be down to replay TC&TF What character? No I mean for TC&TF I know who victor is Hamza from PM, who was made a Hispanic character in RT (not whitewashing but we don't get much rep on S. Asian/Middle Eastern characters) Lena from ACOR, who though used with her proper sprite, is a total nutjob in the reused sprites He’s figured out with his bi-ness tho Oh yea I was Team Zig But I shipped him with Aaron They were very cute Aragon wouldn’t really fit zig’s name Im cutting this thread off No And don’t spam emotes Because Bartie was mentioned twice :CharmanderHi: Separate channel! We’ll post updates soon Happy birthday! So trr mc would definitely say this when with Hana _ _ Ok y’all do not spam istg Probs ooh? where does that show it for you Ohh It like had to refocus itself so I’m guessing maybe they’re putting in effort her E This feels off The question Mark situation should have a gap right? Between the ¿ and the name? Holy crap they changed maxwell’s name But left drake and hana’s right Why would they change JUST Max’s name Like Olivia’s is the same too I don’t really know the dialogue but I’m going based on a hunch of what I remember from the actual book Looks like diamond outfits don’t carry over Oof My Max is treated to this? Guys did you not know That the entirety of the California squad Works at PB? Why do you think we so casually discuss infiltrating @Metta is their accountant Somehow Metta you might wanna bring that up to them and not on the server Real talk tho, if PB was on this server, there’d likely be some contempt at the whole “scripts” thing We’re not the only ones that do the script stuff Just we’re the ones that do this for a community on discord Because we care for y’all And we want a healthy conversation server to discuss it all We let our frustrations out here But classy We don’t actively bully PB Because we’re better than that I actually can’t with this book A toxic ex kidnaps you And is aided by the queen And diamond choice Dude just divorce her She doesn’t get to apologize and be forgiven Honestly this is such BS Wrong gender, hun “Princess Fiona “ 🎶I wanna hot cup of cocoa with a marshmallow or two🎶 MW sam definitely has a crush on Cassandra She *definitely* appreciated sam in that premium outfit LARA gala Probably the dinner one too How were all your exams? Im good! Done with finals and all so enjoying my break It was stressful But it’s over now 1. Kenna Rys 2. Two male, two female - Maxwell, Raydan, Val, Sonia 3. Azura, Everett, Anton 4. Trilogy, action packed, they resolve modern cordonia’s issues Not sure how that’s a comedy... Perhaps because It’s comedic That it’s considered a proper romance I would go to a hotel Check in Just to eat waffles At their continental breakfast Rather than buy that diamond choice I got the update Nothing regarding categories Cliffington Construction company ceo Also had the same house thanks Emi! please take your time with files stuff! I thought Metta picked the profile pic he did for the hell of it Honestly I thought he liked TRH book 1 the best Especially the walker ranch chapters Kamilah? ACOR Outfits were great Plus Lena was the one valid version of her sprite What I don’t understand is how the five kingdoms/cordonia went from Magic and blades align To magic in scarcity, deception, and partying To Apples And balls That’s why I said background I think it’s still regarded as canon tho Since the people are real In the game I’m sure the real Kenna was badass So hartfeld gets a lot of revenue just for that name drop Isn’t Nathan related to the starlings v Stirrings You guys do know the script is up in #🍎the-apple-obsessed-monarchy right It’s now edited so that only 18+ peeps can use it The book is not safe for kids If you are above the age of 18 and have not been give me the time, use #📮discord-suggestions-and-requests and request for it They really love NYC for a company that exists in California SF was three years ago It’s pm always East coat Coast Or cordonia Give us a California book PB That isn’t stereotyped Another one That’s not a mainstream city Mc needs to go to T4 in Dublin You don’t want to know lol what he said We aren’t trashing the east coast We’re just tired of all the love it gets from Pb I want MC to go to MSJHS Have t4 Complain at the work environment it's legit what MSJHS Is the environment is highly competitive which makes it extremely toxic and there's a t4 near mhm it was part of the summer book and nantucket in Witsdhifkadja Lu I will spoil the winner of a season for you ah yes during the "travels" of BB2 or 3 also PM2 just being all over the place THE WINNER IS IVY FISHER I Introduced her to masterchef and we're watching season 8 together but she's watching the first few seasons so i said i'd spoil the winner of the season but i didn't say what season and for what show it actually shouldn't be taking NSFW chat stars wtf Wait where is marigold from Oh And her face is used for WHite RT MC’s mom Thank you omg!! RT was a good story We love when two sisters rise up against the capitalist society They rose against the tides of oppression Normally they will be more honest They keep saying ROD is in the works First action Getting Mona out of jail It really speaks to the whole thing with IG versus Diacord Where we see all these requests for TNA2 I guess they had to make both LIs a problem Because making one the savior would make it easier Like I said I like isobel but appearance wise I don’t think any of them are LI worthy I hope this is a free option ~~Or did she come back a while ago~~ Damn nova’s been quite for a while Hmm I hope the slowly more active members stay active To meet Pri and her chaos @Priyudi wanna join the chaotic crew Pri you better stay off of spoilerland to study No It’s still distracting ~~Also no one noticed the server name change anyway~~ It won’t be helpful And sign you up for hashcode ~~now there’s a new chaos~~ The admins have lined up their chaos Tatsu is weird That’s the mc free wedding dress for BaBu2 Deciding Mc’s final person is apparently deciding their lifelong commitment Apparently that dress hugs her curves (the premium one) ~~The only message we deleted was Time for Teletubbies!~~ Still not sure how you can pull the top off and then the bottom off of a one piece swimsuit... It made sense with the two piece But they really wanted to make us feel bad for not buying an outfit Ahhhh ~~I forgot that existed~~ We’ve got two OG chaos fam members back ~~we’re only missing one authoritative figure~~ Authoritative = administration You scrolled so far up firework You definitely saw it Priya wth Ugh the Sofia posts got second in my category The vote is rigged I’m positive half the shit makes no sense for normal choices people The people in my category had a high number of upvotes I was up there but not by a few hundred So no matter how blechy the posts were that won (The witness weird drawing, the Sofia edits, and the gossip girl/the T thing) They still had more upvotes than me People ranked favorite continuing books as OH2, TRH3, and third TRH2? Even the trash storytelling that was TRH3 was more developed than OH2 Also Emi, how was your explanation an unpopular opinion? You were legit stating the facts Three chapters when the entirety of the book before and after was mediocre does not redeem a book The Sofia post won in at least two categories gdi bel I don’t have a leather jacket in On And ofc one of the mods who was nominated won a category She didn’t give off her badass vibes with that redesign They softened the smile He no longer wears the katana while shirtless 🥺 I think in BB3 he doesn’t really either What *didnt* you do is the question Honestly gore ain’t great the only books it makes sense in is the books regarding mystery and such I mean Who wouldn’t (If you were into women) If not you don’t need to simp Did you tell them about the 500 knives she carries And his “stern yet sexy eyebrows” The randomest posts get me leveled up Hold up Blood Is red? This is blasphemy And immortal blood is golden Which autocorrected to Biden but I fixed it Priya? Wrf Wtf Oooh Can you stream this ||so|| I wonder if you can manipulate the code to start at a random chapter ||for fun|| Come to VC Pri TE:WP and my phone, pretty likely tbh but also my calculator though that's more in front of me nothing tangible, other than hss being pb's first game and TF being choice's first story Np Remember when that happens in LH I know the right answer but it’s fun to pick the wrong ones Also the ones where you flirt with anyone and everyone Priya My only memory of vine? What’s 9 plus 10? 21! You stupid Also DAMN DANIEL #🎥media-not-related-to-choices pls #🎥media-not-related-to-choices Love you Pri in a very platonic way ~~At least the fandom had nova for a while~~ That’s why she had full outfits That aren’t that one I’m sure that Pb knows more than they let on There’s a chance they know about spl too But we don’t let the info get out of the server I’m sure my 500 replays of blades to get the best scores before the book finished contributed to its sequel (Because I spent many diamonds and kept replaying so I played the scenes) I am not going to let go of specific, LI only scenes because they matter to me. I am not going to play games within games to get choices to change because of some analytic. Remember that this is *just* a game. And it’s not going to harm you to take a break or *only* read good books. The weight of a good quality book is on no one’s shoulders. If it was, Blades would have changed the game. Okay BIG FUN FACT this is NOT THE CHANNEL for this discussion This channel is for spoilers, not for spoiling the game’s analytics. Emi. You’re gaslighting. Don’t make people feel bad for how they play. You say you’re not but that is *exactly* what you are doing. This server is NOT the audience you need to go off on. There’s just a lot that happened here Also I had no idea side stories didn’t count Someone get me coffee please It’s there but it’s too far away from my bed Highly appreciated worst angry faces in choices Tyler and James also he isn't an ass to people imo, the best antagonist was Anton Severus you could actually feel the betrayal he was like Duffy but gave less hints the most obvious one: "If you can breathe, you can stand, and if you can stand, you can fight" if they ended TRR there, it would've been a high note book 1 was pretty tame, with the  antagonists being the fellow competitors and sort of Tariq book 2, you see that Constantine is the biggest villain, but it still isn't a major thing with the direct assassination attempts of book 3, it shows you from the get go that this is escalated, but fits in with the slowly progressively antagonistic theme TRH's villains were all so predictable TRR redeemed some villains by making them allies and dismissed others hence the channel name I’m a Maybug @Priyudi :marafrogemoji: Everyone was replying to you I had to tell them you’re not there anymore And now you’re on Choices LGBTQIA+ Yeah, Bee’s I’ll message it to you There was never any arguing If it was just one person It would be situational But it happens in *all* his books I bet if Morgan was red headed she’d go through it in WB too Also, we’re not specifically pointing to women And neither is the post It says *grudge* against *gingers* You did Also Probably We’re pointing towards his trend And general way of women getting bad situations In his writing Also Brian’s a douche and if you really paid attention that’s not what the conversation was about Yes, we shouldn’t accuse anyone of misogyny unless they’re blatant We’re just speaking of a pattern Pri this isn’t tea spilling zone lmao truth so....................... check my memes #🐺twilight-but-team-jacob They said Theres only one Jen allowed at Pb There’s only 2 jens allowed at Pb One writes toxic males The other writes never ending sagas What did he work on? What the Yeah I haven’t seen the scripts either That she does But I figure that she’s more about getting content to her followers as soon as possible She likely cares more about giving people the file pictures rather than the scripts We take time Which I think is a good thing Ah Inchresting Watermarking is so ridiculous Like A. It’s not fan made content B. It’s not *your* content I only tolerate her account because  I can see the full body sprites Her obsession with Marco Linfan is rather creepy They had HSS in the wrong place then I fixed it I think bee’s editing will reveal more once it’s done Kio, prayer circle -> #🙏choices-prayer-circle Maybe she blocked? She blocked me but jokes on her I have a second account DJ KHALED Well MLF has some bad takes The point is that they’re not good people And yes That account is going too far But it’s not that bad if you're going to be homophobic you don't deserve appreciation she's presented somewhat problematic opinions in the past we keep our spoilers as unbiased as we can if she can do the same, kudos to her ooh also Kio what's your profile pic that's very cool hmm maybe if i want to commission something for my wattpad profile picture i'm using my old one temporarily the purple one with the glasses yeah this one ooh i see wait what is the cost? i see https://instagram.com/plejaades?igshid=16j9t0gfvjfty No problems i think they used ES's bg for it The moment we knew mw2 won’t exist When they used Sam’s hair Also for the twin’s aunt in class act Every sprite except for one has the same outfit And then one has the BB default blue jacket outfit I think they just used Hispanic WEH mom I think they have a very strict editing thing The wiki I’ve heard They also say “Teja is Indian for X while Desai is Sanskrit for X” Use the actual language WIKIA #emi Bulbapedia is the superior wiki Also Zeldapedia Like that huge Harry Potter website that was like the HP encyclopedia But Rowling sued them for some reason Probs something else They like spam the recent release as the bg Like foreign affairs distracts me https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harry_Potter_Lexicon They chose an unfortunate POC Pic* It’s way too close to a negative acronym Also something - apparently indigenous people want to reclaim the term Indian (my friend was talking about it, don’t quote me) Which I think is important to reclaim your own identity and all But as an actual Indian American it is already a problem when that’s how indigenous people are described (and is confusing) and the two other terms help bring a distinction Like it’s gotten to the point where there was a post where someone said “don’t call yourself Indian if you’re not indigenous!” And someone had to reply with the map of India ...I still think that automatically Like this one character in Zoey’s extraordinary playlist Who is the same state ethnically as me in India  and he calls the POCs at the company BIPOC but as one word and I keep thinking he said as bi people of color because he gives bi vibes oh that wasn't necessarily a bad thing his character is slightly extra and potentiall bi that's really cool OMG haha my cousin's on again/off again gf is more responsive than *he* is and like i'm the one he's most communicative with that is definitely interesting THAT SONG IS A BOP yep they look sculpted but not the good kind ' why make one sprite so oily? both are cool but carter isn't a realistic drawn sprite so the body doesn;t fully work Does my wattpad writing experience count I’ll have you know I have 27k+ reads on my first completed story your favorite band broke up? Zoey had like 2 diamond scene And no hookup in the last chapter They probably rely on Andrew shvartz to make decisions He approves every bad decision And then when someone suggests ginger female LIs have a good time He’s like NAH Except how Nia’s storyline went, BOLAs ruled Also Imtura almost being nonexistent i thought it was like a clasp Yes but it can slide around God choices fans can be assholes If you’re going to critique something do it on a post explicitly made by PB, Jesus i'm curious what it was this time maybe the wedding post from before Could be But they’ve known about her for a while i've always said she needs to get out of the fandom for her own sake because insta fandom is not healthy Lmao I predicted that she’d be back overnight Hey, do you think you can remove the image? You can still see the motion even with the spoilertag and it’s still a bit nauseating, thanks! I took AP CSA in senior year We learned Jack Shit about protons And protos It’s their default response What was said before hand Because maybe you beat them to saying anything Maybe specify the word It also could be something to message Pb about directly The in app thing is for like UI stuff wowwww the character designs for this are *chef's kiss* i can't wait to watch it Depends on the editor’s time, can be anywhere from the day the description released to the day before it comes out Is AME the only book where a male MC can get married? They chose such a non traditional outfit too for the male I forgot about the hand fasting lol I would want to avoid traditional Indian wedding ceremony if I could but uh The main part is ok enough Yeah tbh they’re very long I’ve talked to my parents about it (who also had a smaller wedding) and they asked me if there was any part I would keep And I was like “the actual marrying part with the divider and then seeing each other and all” part Also I get bored during pujas which is most of the ceremony Plus I don’t believe in god Mehendi ceremony is fun I mean like all the wedding day ceremonies maharastrian kurta >>>> the man looks https://tenor.com/view/scheming-evil-plan-evil-patrick-star-gif-5437636 evil ah are lungis and dhotis similar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kWLyInyjOE .img dhoti https://discord.com/channels/447426832371810305/470610936495996928/846100648428175371 https://4.imimg.com/data4/QJ/VD/ANDROID-39308597/product-500x500.jpeg I do Can Drew truly keep a secret tho that shall be tested 🤔 Metta organized the troops God why is the host an actual TV Feels nice to see the ongoing and upcoming section with multiple channels once again Dayum Since when did choices have TOS?
