I liked make Alex and female Taylor It was a French dude Yeah Yea That was so weird I do like that they started their own record label Though it seems a bit unrealistic Ryland I was like Its not Raleigh OMG YES Like Replace the red with white And its literally Roland Ryland I think so It was randomized when you choose both male and female Ive had female Alex when I wanted male Female Ryland Yeah to the 13 year old thing The premium stories are all kinda crap Except for the episode originals up til like prom night Ink was good I used Jules Hair Constantly Until limelight I dont even remember Yea I think end of season 2 Season 3 is the successful record label thing I think I play it only for quality stories that still exist from users Yup I married Alex People wanted Ryland to be redeemed Yup Also PTF isnt playable anymore Update info Yup Also PLL and Clueless There was supposed to be a clueless sequel Yup Theres actually a parody story Which combines all three art styles Pregnant by my twins high school student gang leader father I think its called The Dolan twins actually like did a playthrough of the one for him Fun fact I never finished the Cameron Dallas story They probably didnt have the resources for accuracy with limelight Ink * I love the hairstyles but the weird thing with paywalling some and not others was wack Paywalling meaning that they including some of the best in only premium or only regular True They should mesh all the hairstyles into one template A regular user actually developed lipstick colors for Ink that worked with darker skin tones Shes cool Andrea Elle is really good used that shift escape trick to mark all my servers as read i don't think it's been that way like ever This new font is just wrong I miss the all caps  It feels those edits Judgemental aunts are sucky Im tired of hearing how much fairer I look since they last saw me or how much weight Ive lost One time my great aunt told me Im looking healthy Which is Indian speak for gaining weight Hostels are a really good solution for that independence factor Though I think dorm life versus hostel life is different Priya is a queen for a reason Theyre cool I miss my dorm Though my roomie wasnt the greatest I mean she was nice but she had her bf over all the time And her bf is mildly annoying But he was a nice guy Today is a great day to stan Queen Firework very true today we honor the Queen Firework i as well Life update I unpacked two boxes Of No Dorm room stuff My friend had to pack it for me as I dont live in the state And she was initially going to keep it in her house until I came up for fall quarter But then I couldnt So she shipped it all last Wednesday i don't know why i haven't done this before but i'm listening to the freaky friday broadway soundtrack i've heard the 2018 movie soundtrack enough times in my disney playlist as expected, the broadway soundtrack is much better but also similar singing even though only one actress, the mom character, returns this is ridonculous My biggest regrets on CLub penguin Not tipping the iceberg Not getting all the puffles Not getting to be fire water and ice ninja Idk what the acronym can also imply but good choice I think I know which Sad that the beautiful club penguin acronym can now be associated negatively yeah i realized that i didn;t want to bring it up further thanks forgiving me that reminder though that definitely sounded very wrong out of contextr i remember sharing my password with my friend i changed it literally as soon as i got home though I did Tbf I was 8 Hi gals, gents, and everyone in between/none of the above!

Oh Jassi? you can do  a thing to check your browser history or what episode you're like partially through oofles kk signing off now conference is starting!!!! I posted a pretty straight forward complaint about the last OH2 chapter on the book club post Lot of likes Made me wonder if any of yall were likers I was going to have a chicken bake My mom made omelette Not when theres veggies (Like spinach? Idk) And pieces of eggshell It was overpowering No real ifes Idea But felt like too much Theyre aight But they are SO BLAND ... I dont eat fish Personal I know its a bit ironic because I eat pretty much a whole lot other meat But it just feels morally wrong to eat something like fish, that every fish I dont eat is a fish that doesnt die I have liked the taste of fish when Ive had it but I actively choose not to eat it Are you pesketarian? Because I dont think that refraining from fish means being vegan... Ok Jespre... I genuinely dont understand the point of capes in choices outfits Like the dress is so beautiful already (or butt ugly) And you throw in a cape Hes a clone But has white hair Still confused me i wonder if their chapter update posts are programmed to be posted the second the last chapter of the day is released Oof Lack of literally ANY INFO about the UMB So Im guessing BD and MM in November The other two books in December Thats usually how it works Whatever this book was isnt releasing this year The one in later this year (Last months) To hate Another vip book which is supernatural Baby Dump 2 being likely in November I think the political and mystery will be the same Its a shitty time Go queen firework Getting tests done Its good Im tired I wish I could go back to when I was in junior year of hs, new to choices Literally everything was well done and so novel just annoyed at the lack of *anything* jackie deserves better MC isn't a therapist OH1 had an actual storyline there i've cooled down now i expected a solidification of storyline but there's the Ethan's mom thing, Jackie's panacea issues, Panacea, the broke storyline, and Esme's situation Yasss Trying this thing where I snark on episode stories for inconsistency/poor writing This one story has the WOC/POC as the creeps/antagonists And Caucasian characters as the protagonists (The episode paid stories) My brothers hot friend Im only playing it because I have unlimited reads for the next five hours on that story Plus gonna get so many gems The user made stories are damn good tho Ive found some authors who write quality content Only story Ive seen so far with accuracy in the pronouns. Only one pronoun issue and that was on a free choice Nvm there were two back to back Now So did the wife just not have a bump at all, or was she one of the cases where you have little to no bump until you near the end I think that the polls are based on what theyve already written (since books are planned out and written up to a year in advance) and they use the results to gauge when the books should be released. YES As a baker Id love that One of my favorite things about baking is that Ive done so much of it that I can talk about the technicalities at length Cali squad should meet up and have a baking session Yessssss That would honestly be really fun Me and spirits will be captains You can have Metta on your team Im like 90% Id argue with him about spoilerland rankings Ill bring my baking equipment You want to be on a team thats focused or a team of banter Because I get *competitive* Jaz, Bee, Yunqi, Black Scepter, yall gotta choose your sides No firework wants to judge All Cali squad members must compete Unless we can fly out firework out here it would be hard for her to take your spot Im not 21 so this aint happening You can have cider and soda and hot Cheetos There will be corruption involved I guarantee it Thats a bad trope A homophobe realizing theyre gay after actively ||assaulting|| or bullying the other gay character Idk But if it happens that way Its just a bad trope Homophobic politicians are pretty vocal about their agenda If yall are into The Good Place, Im doing a fic on AO3 combining the characters from one of my favorite shows and TGP I said Id stop writing fics for the other show but inspiration struck Spoiler alert: ||everyone is dead|| I will! Yes Well do a zoom call when the Cali squad gets together I want a woman head chef She should be the forced LI We need a woman forced LI Yea A non GOC forced female LI any forced LI thats GOC is written as male usually Ya Remember the Paolo fiasco I just realized there are multiple Paulos Paulos The one whos from TNA Who was a sexist pig and asked Sam if they agreed even if they were female Adam we absolutely have to have a baking discussion Im thinking of making red velvet cake soon This cake had ganache Thanks ! The trick is to put about 1 3/4 cup to a pound (2 cups) of semi sweet chocolate in a bowl Bowl^ Then heat up about a cup or so of heavy cream until its about boiling Pour it over the chocolate, wait for it to fully set in (about 10 mins) Then whisk it together Then leave it at room temp but covered for two hours Hope it helps! You dont necessarily have to hand whisk muffins, they can be done with a stand mixer, but fold in ingredients once the dry and wet are mixed together When you realize most of your mood swing behavior yesterday can be explained by hardcore PMSing :/ it was worse because I didn't get mine last month so when it gets late like this I usually cramp I straight up split a croissant in half filled up half with a good number of semisweet chocolate chips inside and warmed it so i had a make your own chocolate croissant it was good the calories actually help because they burn off in the period apparently the need to eat a bunch of calories is from that also chocolate is a godsend Sloane QUEEN i love those adorkable queens It is relatively toxic Best way to deal with rejection?

It accidentally ended when I sent this But North America oof Ive realized that even if I like a fic author, if I try to get more interested in their works, theres always a pattern and its tiresome at a point Like theres this Harry Potter fic author whos had this one story I liked but reading the rest of her works I noticed that in each story Hermione behaves stupidly, Harry calls her out for it extremely coldly, they get married, and Rons written as trash I get his character traits werent great but he was still a good person Yayyyyy!!

Using Voice Chat/#no-mic-chat Metta you didn't play last time @( ) milquetoast  down to play? awesome head over to #no-mic-chat i'll create one for whatever reason my flair on the sub has Benji (Gag) and sick Raf and idk why holy crap that's sick someone changed Zoey's flair sprite to Benji i put a post on the sub about it like wtf but why *Zoey* yea but Gaius is Gaius Benji is traumatic okay so apparently the QB sprites are all Benji but still traumatic I deleted it i went on Fb for the first time in a few hours and this is the first thing i see holy crap Whoever says that next will have to stream an episode on VC aw :/ why are you like this i permit you all to temporarily spam to get that off the screen kaleen don't post that again pls i'm going to remove it for the sanctity of my peace of mind and arachnophobes i'd say spoilertag but it's a bit too creepy perhaps it would've been more appropriate...October 31 They actually dont do much story wise Still cute tho whoever's down for a game of Among Us, the code and server is in no-mic-chat Huh Wack Oh its still Friday insiders is out y'all ooh the political book is foreign affairs and the supernatural book is wolf bride ...and that's literally everything they apparently said it was a GOC story ...it doesn't sound like one i hope the political one is, though Random thought -> they didn't mention the return of MTFL Best thing to wake up to Pennsylvania thanks for believing in the guy born there! Just a random thought Do you guys think that playing freemium games where you don't spend actual money (hence having to decide on when to spend the currencies you get for free versus save up) helps when making spending decisions in real life situations? anyone who understands C++ pls help Im trying to implement a BFS it's fine What is the most memorable MC name you've chosen, and why? (Did it mean something that fit the theme of the book, did another character have the same name, did it mean something to you) One of my old play files of choices - Aurora (NB), Arden (PTR), Apolla DuBaer (TE), Andromeda Pendragon (RCD), Andi (AME), Arina (ACOR), Amelia Renaldi (TRR), Alana (BP), Amara Miller (D&D), Anna Percy (OH), Araminta (ROE) I had a whole A theme That's really cool Arzaylea! Yeah i tried to stick with a name scheme for the siblings, but kept Violet, the Aunt, and the LI's names the same So for the A names: Amanda (Jess), Araminta (Katie), Aramis (Alex), Aramet (Nicole), Aracelli (Violet) ooh nice If I had a relatable Indian MC, Id name her that way Yea trh is up and edited I just saw a choices ad that uses a weird face But is literally TNA finally getting butter in stick form instead of those pound cube things will make measuring it out much easier have there been any book descriptions uploaded ya that came out on wednesday ugh great is RT's next chapter going to be heavy Ive been getting some really sexist ads lately for games Like this woman who is a bit disheveled asks a guy out And hes like are you kidding? And shows her this more attractive woman So she decides that I will change myself And then its a makeover Ok this one started with that And with no explanation Transitioned into house renovating Lol so apparently that dude is the ex that cheated on her in the game If the black haired guy is in the ad hes a loyal one Yeah cuz I think that guy is the LI Their artwork in the actual game is nice Yay! Li hairs can be wayyyy better than the mcs So Id be chill Also with reused diamond hair There were so many good hairstyles in TF and TRR, Reuse them PB Not this far city Where Like the message Starboard must be down Yea Im down Yes Aight Lmk Among us is being mean and Im not able to join rn  It keeps disconnecting me from the server Is it just me, or is PB overcompensating for the insane diamond scene amount in witness By being barebones with diamond scenes in chapters as of late Like theres an outfit and a diamond scene Thats all Also TRH recently I still dont understand why Pb thought it was a good idea to put another book on Friday Like its just Wednesday and Friday in the schedule now Why Its got at least 4 more chapters 5* It was 2018 was the age of experimenting where they had books almost daily They shouldve It was already cursed Pls dont star messages that talk about NSFW content like ||porn|| Also Arzaylea please spoilertag Underage server members shouldnt see that stuff in normal channels What? Yes Thats what I meant When I think Ive gotten the message right and I forget the apostrophe  Thanks! The day an Indian character had my name I will screenshot it And keep it to myself My dads name has been used for a character before Which is...weird Ooh?? For what book Not really Cool beans Yea I didnt want to ask you what your name was so I asked you the series Since theres *quite* a few names in each book in choices Unless your name was in witness because theres like 7 characters Omg I feel bad for choices players named Cassian Amelia is also the name of both I think the nana And violets daughter in ROE Drew you also share a name with Andy Kang Sort Sorta Omg as long as you dont share a name with Cody from ILITW That guy was a creep That everyone thought his sprite was reused for Garrett for whatever reason See you got a good association too So there appears to be a TRR-esque episode story Its called faking mr. right Even has the body up art style of TRR and choices in general Im reading it for the diamonds Ill let yall know how bad it is But they talk about competition Royalty Marriage And the country is called Ruscovia I named her Olivia Nevrakis lol Were heading to Vegas for her best friends wedding And her friend whos getting married is Violet and the other is Rachel OMFG SHE LIVES IN NH NY* Remind yall of someplace? Thanks! The Princess is Leona I think its Leon if you choose to date men Ill find it out when they mess up the pronouns/name for a diamond choice anyway Shes even blonde like white Liam omg Shes got an arranged marriage proposal for Princess Fiona Ok I love this outfit I dont think this is wedding appropriate... Why theyre pushing this blue Im Olivia Nevrakis, My hair is as red as the blood of the people I slay I date girls why is my ex a boy Its not her house, its the cage Surprised this wasnt a diamond choice Cafe Im ducking into women in this story bitch stop pushing Brody So this is the prince Literally named Mhm Im love reacting Lives Were seeing how alike this is to TRR Im into both I replayed just to see what the name of the prince is set to But my main game is Princess named Leona For whatever reason no matter your sexuality you dated a guy named Brody for a while We stan this grammatical errors Character named Ash... hmmm In a bachelorette party In Vegas.... This is wayyy too short One of the Princess men Also Im really annoyed that the LIs friends are solely men regardless of story Feels like the Statue of Liberty They really enjoy this marrying a random stranger in chapter 1 in Vegas trope Episode wtf Yet again Getting married BEFORE revealing royal status First time I agree with the free choice Run out of there b 5 so far 12 in total I bet This is Princess Fiona Nah Im still reading RTs chapter lol But the descriptions are interesting I stan the milkshakes Yeah Im not working on either of those til next week Ive got finals to worry about rn Thanks!! Thanks! 100% He rules Wait why did you spoiler tag coffee Mara jumped in quickly to get something so the bot was  triggered for some reason That moment when this blog post is more informative than the insiders email... Is that your MCs name? Its like they were trying to find a compromise And failed I guess it makes sense that they changed it to accommodate the accents but still be the uppercase format Maybe coding limits? Im thinking of like USUM In Pokmon where they pushed the 3DS to the absolute limit PROFESSOR SWAN? YOU THERE PROFESSOR SWAN? She really wants you to know she got that PhD I wonder how much Pendergast tuition is I feel like this is a question that should have been answered Especially when MC transferred Since hartfeld is a pretty costly school Beat the elite 4 + champion! Yes! I spent a couple of hours grinding today Then said screw it and went in Pretty much handled the entire Elite four + Champ with feralligatr And used other mons as cannon fodder for healing So the rest of that TRR-esque story is out ...I chose a female At l least the kids are actual siblings in game Whos cevin Sprite wise Dm me this link Made my first mostly cooked dessert! Included pudding from scratch Will send pics tmrw! Why are we jingling bel Its jingle *bells* So I wanted to make a joke that also perfectly captures the situation Wanna more positive second server, come to CAD First server is of course spoilerland ...bel I didnt even realize you changed the name OMG apparently Lindsay from STD Shes Bengali The last name sounded familiar and someone on the sub was like Bengali rep! So I doublechecked and Basu -> Bipasha Basu No one really talks about that I love Lindsay So @Metta came to the realization today that you can get married at your wedding in AME3 i think it's actually something you can apply to real life even irl you can get married at your wedding Idk why but I thought it was from a different ethnicity entirely I basically was pronouncing it differently in my head Oof Totodile ftw Metta world peace So Brendan in Emerald is just as dickheaded as Blue and silver And he is MAJORLY softened in ORAS for example After you beat flannery in Oras He offers to go with you to Petalburg In Emerald He mentions Norman And says (and I quote Unlike you, {May}, your dad looks like hes really tough I do believe with all my heart That red and blue are boyfriends And by SM/USUM theyre husbands honeymooning on alola So i finally read through the billionaire bachelors for the gems on episode And they kept referring to the black card option (if you reject the bachelor at the end) And because the LIs propose and you choose between them I wondered if we were actually gonna get that option We end up doing so in the last chapter And I took the black card option Especially since Id never interacted with the guy as an LI until he was thrown in at the end But I disliked the one Id paired up with for most of the story (Black card is the unlimited credit card, you get to spend the billionaires money) Honestly just be like Imma head out https://tenor.com/view/ight-imma-head-out-spongebob-imma-head-out-ima-head-out-gif-14902967 I remember there used to be a channel where youd be muted And you couldnt access anything until you apologized for your behavior So Im guessing its like If you did something really bad? Im guessing its accessed only by admins And muted role Its interesting Theyre probably practicing their mock trial skills Maybe just to be more dramatic The three strike system is valid unless they pull some bad shit Yea Lu dont do it But if they figure out its you Also silent lurkers They could spill I can assure yall that we dont have one here If theres any issues we contact through DM Yet some of em badmouthed us there Witness mc wouldnt be worth Redfields time, lbh Hartfeld is the least problematic TE in VOS Duffy wouldve been found out in five minutes thanks to Atlas Sufficient distraction Plus, Max would definitely be attracted to all the OH LIs Maxwell and raf would be a bad pairing Baz and Max, though... Maddie and June Were spitting better ideas Than 90% of choices books this year Guys we should totally create spoilerland crossovers Where we create stories together Based on choices Without the graphic art probably Unless someones willing to be the artist Like a graphic novel Or a choose your own adventure book  la Club Penguin That was epic The crossovers at the end of th:m Hero  Soniaaaaaaa She truly is My Soniya Iykyk If you had to choose between sending Landry or Ansel to jail Who would you choose Im glad he was written out after the softball game HIGH DRIVE RIGHT FIELD IT IS RIGHT AT DR. LANDRY OLSENS FACE Seriously hearing kruk/kuip announce homers is the BEST And declan Also Jon Miller I didnt cuz diamond spending If its been a year+ Its okay I would take another book of TRH If we got all the characters together I would pay PB Because *collarbones* Okay So out of all of you Who owns A Leather jacket I got one and it looks good with everything My dress jacket goes well with everything Including my kung fu clothes We were gonna go up to SF but then our traveling car had engine issues I have I had crappy period times And my dad got a whole ass box of the sandwiches I was dying from cramps during online tutoring If youre ever in Newark Go to samrat Amazing chicken In California Weve established my cali squad status I dont live there https://tenor.com/view/cool-b99-brooklyn-nine-nine-andy-samberg-detective-jake-peralta-gif-11062927 It was fun img Omg Move to San Leandro I think they werent able to continue it because of Pb Someone got pissy about the big deal that was made over his leave 9k4 ES is popular with those people Im living it through AME ES was completely unique Hero made them look like real people in a more cartoon style Quinns CG during handfasting  The gambles of old PB  Lmao this guy is flossing Lbh I would 100% be down for Bryce lahela Still got two hours! I will host a VC party every so often where people can jam out to holiday songs Sing as off-key to all I want for Christmas is you as you want AND I Dont want a lot for Christmas Anyone who wants to sing all I want for Christmas is you Go join VC On Friday Anytime Friday really As long as its after 11 AM PST Why would I ever wake up at 8 AM On purpose I wake up at 8 AM Randomly Awww So in the Cali squad We have an accountant A CS major/aspiring author Student Please continue On Drew, Yunqi. Black scepter We can probably pull off being qualified to join PB At least convince them to make an internship position I need summer internship Gotta have a job qualification Metta can work the numbers Are you a uni student Whats your interest geared towards Im sure Mettas numbers prowess can help get PB out of a financial low Ooh cool! Youll make the animals in the stories incorporated well And treated well by story plot Jazz can help bring the young aspect to Choices Where high schoolers actually act their age Lu will rewrite OH3 Ok I Know this isnt the way it actually is But OH gives me the impression that all regular doctors like MC, Jackie, sienna, etc do is diagnose and pass them off to specific professionals But thats also really just because theyre residents But thats quite literally how theyre written in the book I have an uncle whos a doctor and I know he does more than that I do think that OH shouldve written them better To respect the medical professionals that have been saving the world Also Im curious as to the major differences between clinic doctors (like the PAMF doctors) And hospital doctors Palo alto medical foundation Its where I have my physicals and other checkups Its not a hospital thats for sure Its mainly for pediatric and physician appointments And they have radiology and a lab Also a surgical center I have heart wants what it wants in my head rn Idk Ooh All the books which share MC sprites with LH and HFTH Cole and Max would definitely date for a hot second Hana would be nudged out of her shell by Serena Who would end up with Olivia, having such headstrong personalities Horatio is more like Max I think in quirkiness But Cole is better suited Ben and Liam Drake and Mark Metta, Pri, and I are kind of doing a three way versus of Pokemon fire red that Pri and I randomized And Ive been naming Pokmon after choices characters Pris been naming characters after discord peeps Bee, Jess, Bel, youre all mons in pris game Yee Metta took a day off And Pri and I both hit the end-ish of the game Individually I won! You are articuno So...this happened Not sure, Pri mentioned in passing but hasnt clarified Theres certain phrases in English writing that get me annoyed when reading them Slips into a smirk Dips <food> into <some runny food or drink> Person clucks Its like a Mark of disapproval or something? It just leaves a sour taste in my mouth I dont normally buy the premium hairs but it was CUTE Its just a sensory thing I actually really love Mirandas hair and Im mad that MC doesnt get that option The rockstars manager is trash LMAO THEY didnt set it right These stories always involve such an asshole reporter Also her name, Lisa Sleeter is an obvious parody on Rita Skeeter Its the Christmas premium story Just came out today All I want for Christmas Thanks  I havent made them in so long Do it! Metta has a valid post on Reddit Go check it out https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/k5nu7u/charlie_thompson_our_favorite_little_sister/ one of the comments is my favorite All the pro-Charlie peeps are hitting up your post metta...did they take down your post I dont see it in the regular feed Wait I see it Lu were twins I think that it was originally a competition between Metta and I for the better nickname Disaster bis get disaster bis only No discrimination against disaster gays And apparently Im not disaster https://aminoapps.com/c/choicesamino/page/blog/blades-of-light-and-shadow-quiz/1JXE_Bkoi6uYdEv28JlBE8Jg2XBGQ2GLoW Metta no spam Lol it was me who sent the Blades quiz Just quick thing, please turn off mentions if replying to me, thank you! Its okay! It will show the blue @ on, just press it to turn it off I know youre joking but thats a lil rude We do gentle reminders in this server household Im the servers young, little bit naggy, mom Nah youre the cousin whos a little bit new but has got the spirit of it all Youre the...disaster gay uncle that everyone calls uncle despite not being related? Mettas the grandpa Nah hes just old Always reminiscing  about the good old days When the limos you went to prom in had CD players Will occasionally yell RIP KOBE in the middle of a family dinner I swear Half the time Metta heads offline He comes back to me roasting him Nah I aint putting that much effort in If its not a paid job Lu was If someone pays for my VIP subscription I will provide quality commentary Those things feel very sus I like the layout tbh I genuinely missed the books being full thumbnails and not that little dogeared thing OOH As THE BP COVER IS NOW THE SAME The RCD logo is...meh Theyre all weirdly larger Is he not allowed to be Hispanic and have blue eyes? The difference in OH background colors is pretty prominent The white in book 2 is much whiter Just as the book got whiter with the Ethan forced romancing I know that Middle Eastern people can be blue eyed (thinking of Leila from A Thousand Splendid Suns) and though not sure about blue eyes but theres several green eyed Indians Random effing change I paid 19 DIAMONDS FOR NICE HAIR And it gets changed to THIS BS Apparently in the original, free story it also changed because of bugs so it BETTER be fixed Fun fact, i saw the same sweater in dash and Lilly I feel like they just use the bitchiest dialogue to get people to pay diamonds Bel thanks for the updates! Sorry Im on a hair tirade Episode They really want us to live the tired ass barista outfit life Finally my hair is back This is the one episode premium story these days with no closet options That you can actually change your hair Wonder if they thought they could get away With using charli damelio Ugh Really annoyed that every chapter starts with the free hairstyle I *love* the beehive bun, I do, but this is just BS Unless its one of those stories theyre testing and will rerelease later on It is Beehive is my style tho I really hated this best friend Honestly predicted this She sounds like JENNINGS LMAO Im just gonna imagine her as Jim Jennings Were supposed to pay diamonds to wear it Otherwise she wears it One diamond outfit Im NOT buying Girl get you and your ugly ass eyebrows away from me Right now 5 chapters But they go up to 12 Right? You know, i really want Episode to have ONE story where the gf that ends up being broken up with is a sweetie pie That ends up being like a best friend Rather than a bitch Dont gaslight, bitch None of these LIs are conventionally interesting Basically a Christmas story where your now rockstar ex comes back to your small town to shoot a documentary Thats all I get from this Idek Itll probably be behind a diamond scene I wont pay for Also She trying to fight her gf I just want ONE Episode premium GOC story Where the female version of the LI Isnt only best friends with men Like the male Hmm now I wanna know which it was This is this storys version of the ROD sweater outfit I *think* it was a story focused on the woman LI or something Right Sounds like the kissing booth Toxic story The second movie featured an LI that is cast aside but is a much better option for the MC Honestly Id rather date a coffee shop owner than an actress Who would want to live in the spotlight all the time ? Heres the plot twist That will lead to the LI throwing a benefit concert To save the coffee shop That is *literally* the plot of Christmas in the Smokies Who cares if libraries are tiny No they were just repeating the rude comment made by the camera guy in their head apparently this random dress from three years ago was still in the shop on Main Street Finally, non-barista outfit i think so Ew But WOA I actually love the TRR cover The ads are all smutty So I feel like theyre drawing in those attracted by the ads Im so glad that HSS and Hollywood U ended before they could turn them into this Though they make MC look like Belle from Beauty and the Beast Remember when PB kinda redeemed itself for 2019 with a bunch of Christmas books last year Ya ! Done! Next time ask in #discord-suggestions-and-requests , though No worries! I like this look Really hate these snobs Id rather wear a flour sack to the wedding Which is apparently the other option I could get behind this bedroom (Different story than the Christmas one yall) This dialogue is the BEST Honestly I dont even understand the queens reasons to be contemptuous We shouldnt be forced to live in a place where such a b*tch of a queen resides ...why is she still in nightclothes this bitch needs to realize that if she actually treated MC with respect, seh would *be* respected WOOO FREE CHOICE FOR WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY A DIAMOND CHOICE Theres a such thing as showing fake excitement for a loved one woman Tournament? Ah Yasss Id discord call with you to help out That reminds me ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU SINGALONG AT 5 PM PST Nah I just wanna play among us But its easier to do it with a partner, ya know We have the occasional game Or try to Sims is high quality Gaming Ive noticed that the people with 500-1000 diamonds complain the most about diamond choices on the server While the ones with considerably less talk about saving up for the same ones This book doesnt even end with this Giants fan Metta gives me crap for hating the Dodgers Lakers-Warriors niners-Seahawks Giants-Dodgers Rivalries for the ages More or less When was that One of my good friends who introduced me to choices He was a cheerleader In HA Hs* Senior year He was actually the first male Cheerleader in my hs Also we had some very straight male people who were damn good actors in our plays Our theatre department was competitive Because its sexist? I guess? I could throw and catch a football decently We sucked the last few years If hs Never went to a sports game Tho Until I went to college and went many times in fall quarter Ugh Yea^ Oof Yikes Okay you should spoilertag that Because it contains 18+ content This Ugh chrome books I hate them Influencers somehow have enough money to pay for said houses Like those tik tok people that have their own houses If youd asked me 10 years ago what 19 year old me would be doing, Id have said I was either a hair salon owner (I had weird job dreams as a kid) or at Harvard for law school Crap drew I just took one when you said that People to THIS DAY ask me why I didnt go into law And Ive got multiple reasons Including not being 15 anymore Yea People dont get that either If I had the funds Id open a bakery First write a book Im working on that first Itd be empty because I bake I also havent created my own recipe If I had resources to blow Id Experiment Probably something like an Indian baked dessert Maybe experiment with French and Indian fusion I would realize that the owner is Metta And blackmail into giving up the cookies and cream once a month ...but Metta we wouldnt know your real name So we would be gambling on the ownership thing I know Ill ask the owner their feelings about Kayden Vescovi Their opinions on drake walker And Barthelemy Beaumont the second He probably grew up the right way But without them biscuits He became a tiny man Bertrand and Maxwell both had walker biscuits whilst in Cordonia So they grew up normal damn the one with the most life experience is asking others for alcohol advice Tastes like medicine i have absolutely 0 plans Thats actually such a shit situation It appears that Metta has gotten exactly what he asked for And more it goes shake fan high heat we don't have an ultra fan that isn't a server regulator :/ The tweet replied to is literally what happened during my Junior and senior years of hs The only reason they stopped in fall of senior year was because of college apps and students need recommendation letters from their teachers Congrats!

We had originally planned to launch it this year, but due to stretched resources and the prioritization of our team members' health, we made the decision to release this mysterious book in 2021. But dont take it from us... take it from Andrew, the Book Lead!

Ive loved working on mystery Books for Choices since the days of Most Wanted, and I think fans of the genre are going to love this one. In Crimes of Passion, a truly terrifying serial killer stalks New York City, and itll take a pair of very unlikely partners to bring him down! You can expect spooky thrills, exciting action, plenty of crime scene investigation, and that special wonderful blend of snarky slow-burn that you only get with two partners bickering over a crime scene. - Andrew this sounds like MW but with more romance FUCK Blades of Light and Shadow, Book 2: As Blades Book Lead Andrew mentioned in our Blades Q&A, you meet new villains, explore fantastic locations, gain new skills... and even add some new members to your party! Because of the large amount of resources Blades requires, we estimate it won't be released until 2022. It'll be a quest worth waiting for, so as always, thank you for your support. New books in the works: While weve had to push back some of our 2020 books, the good news is, that just means an even fuller, more exciting slate for next year! Weve already teased the book about solving crimes... but how about a Book where you argue them in court? In this brand new title, youll compete for status in one of New Yorks most high-end law firms, navigating controversial cases, outwitting scheming rivals... and discovering just how steamy the laws of attraction can really be!

As a special holiday treat, well also mention one other Book were working on... one that falls in one of our most-requested genres ever. Lets just say it involves making tough choices for a rugged group of survivors... in a world where the dead have begun to rise!

And finally, because many people have asked: we will have multiple books where youll be able to select your gender. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE BOOKS WE WANT like hero the stuff they talk about sounds promising TBH the mystery book sounds like crimes of passion is MW2 but they're actually incorporating romance ya it's likely not going to be COP = MW2 but it legit sounds like MW2 the plot is basically MW it's not fair btw their end of the year blogpost was literally content-less like who cares about the year in review we want to get info closure it is, if they promote literally only that at the start TF has the most reads in general though their acting like they're the ones in privileg like we've been begging them for good content GOC full fleshed LIs lack of smut this year has been PB's smuttiest year they have no right to act this uppity we're so cool for giving 2 female LIs to 3 male LIs instead of a 1 to 3 ration ratio FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS ONE you can choose their pronouns i wonder if any of PB's employees uses a fake account to pretend to be a fb mom and they say shit like fb moms tend to say to see how many people agree i legitimately don't put anything past them considering how much more conservative the reddit has gotten i feel like Pb sent some of the fb moms the link to the reddit page told them to go ham i made jokes about the whole UMB remaining a mystery and voila metta got me my most upvotes AND my first gold thanks chaos ~~It was also his meme~~ he ran out of posts allowed so I posted it remember that one guy who was adamant about Bertrand being innocent and talked shit about Maxwell i legit didn't even prep for the ACT essay and i got an 8 which...was out of 12 but still no :MunchlaxMunch: i want to see this now he should just play every savannah diamond scene but he hates her?

Philosophy was boring af Getting these choices adds Who would want a mug that says dalton enterprises Id legit buy a mug with Everett Rourkes company logo Over dalton enterprises Idk But Id rather have that over DE Because girl power is NSFW According to PB But apparently DE is Ugh Poppy would need to actually show remorse and Zoey would need to NOT be sidelined Before I ever relent on poppy Lmao Someone needs to show her up tried my keurig out today will be entering class caffeinated woot woot So this person has good points but they seem to be flossing over the whole thing with e lack of consent This book just isnt my tea Im gonna wait til its released to all players and if people find it better later on I dont like controlling LIs VIP ends for me on Saturday and Im not buying it again Im gonna delete the parts of this that are spoilers yes, it's 18+ role only though yup there you go, but next time use #discord-suggestions-and-requests Youve missed out on Andrews intense keyboard typing Still counts That reminds me Were making a GC for lu to help us with stats I just cant make it on mobile Its part of uni technidelly Technically You can either transfer Or complete four years Two years of CC = associates degree Pri now you can change your profile pic back Paige, wrong-ish channel I think Idk but I thought the convo was somewhere else PRI GO LOOK AT LU BEING A Fab person Awwwwwww Lu and Metta have taken your place in chaotic scripts Hell yeah we do -ft set Mumbai @Priyudi -ft map -ft set India/Mumbai @Priyudi Who was the user Exactly Lu No Drake is good behavior only on this server I think the only LIs this doesnt necessarily apply to is Bastien This book is legit a pay to play because its smutty The way they phrased the bastien scene vs. what was given If they didnt Change HC they wont change WN WB*  @Priyudi weigh in pls I rule the XP stage  I remember when my goals were as trivial as beating Metta In the ranks Then I beat Pri and firework without trying True RT its wholesome A few grotesque CG but thats more about climate change and corruption Ew Dont read witness Its not worth the completionist role No Metta you have VIP You dont need to diamond mine Little girl becomes murderous 16 year old In about 3 years Somehow Yeah Your point? Wait... Babe WELCOME BACK, SPIRITS!! spirits is the one who created the Cali Squad group chat y'all it's fabulous for Spirits to be back but please do not spam emotes :CharmanderHi: Is perfectly acceptable as a reaction to their message or ya know, a regular "welcome!" it may take a few minutes for starboard to pop it up carlbot's doing his best Im being mommed by my family friends parent cuz Im heading back to college no she's telling me all the ayurvedic stuff Yesss thats awesome Adam! Yay!!! Enjoy all the diamond scenes  Np My friend, ladies and gentleman No its apparently a trailer for some game called doom eternal Its a demon through the protagonists eyes Idk but thats probably contingent on if you saved the game on an account If you dont buy the premium outfit in MM Go check #mismatch no you literally show up in your undies So considering PB decided to make three books with canon connections to the choices-verse movies in this chapter, lets dive in. I believe that MTFL, with pretty much no references to older books other than in movies, exists in a parallel universe to the rest of choices. Now heres the point of contention. Bachelorette Party features Hero as a comic book (or am I think of RCD?) But hero coexists with Endless Summer Endless Summer exists in the same universe as TF series, which ties back to everything Including TE, which also ties to BP with Ryders character Thus, BP exists in a separate universe from both the main choices verse and the MTFL universe, where a Hartfeld and Pendergast does exist but never had the storylines associated with TE and TF But were popular enough to have a series made of characters who graduated from the place (TF, VOS) And every parallel universe in choices means that the central plots exist as movies, tv shows, comics, and books Which means theres a universe where TC&TF actually happened, resulting in a modern day cordonia where magic is all over the place and they dont rely on balls and apples for peace. Thank you for attending my Ted Talk. So literally nothing in January if you had VIP Im guessing kyras just not gonna be part of the story Were gonna have fifteen over the top references to the fact that Aurora is being friendzoned  by Pb every chapter Its good, its just every player that had VIP knows how the story goes So with MTFL ending The only stories were gonna have until feb are BABU and Foreign affairs Im not discouraging you aw hmm i wonder what the word finale mean s it might have something to do with "the final book in the series" not sure though ~~also me and metta decided to fill out the subreddit mod application~~ which means that if by some lightning striking a person or a person winning the lottery that one of us gets it we're gonna have to not shit talk the subreddit ~~Not that we'd disallow talking about its mess on SPL anyway~~ me and lu would be the new chaotic mods we cut down the 500 posts saying the same thing all the posts that shit talk an innocent person we will kick ass and take names exactment i wanted to see the best defenders on SPL go off on reddit also when people talk about the lack of LGBTQ+ rep or the way JBH tends to culturally appropriate books for it to not be downvoted to hell and not back i mean there's a lot of stuff to be done but yeah we'd let the Bartie memes in Its actually kinda cute WARDELL STEPHEN CURRY i'm reading all the first chapters it's so fun without paying for diamond choices Cuteeeeeeeeee Paige youre too server baby for tats Mhhhhm Damn dude Wait youre her crush or shes your crush Good To Know Weird The only person who Ill make fun of for his pierced ears is my cousin who did it within like the first month of college My cousin aint it Hes flannel bbq boy No thats from Pitch perfect https://tenor.com/view/pitch-perfect-rebel-wilson-fat-amy-lesbi-honest-gif-4754285 Aight So Ive cancelled my subscription to vip Still shows me vip keys Its been almost a day since it was supposed to expire Aww damn  Ive read most of them y'all did that fast also Emi still have the whole VIP shenanigan Rip my vip yup ... are you on the book club channel?? :hmm: Though great when I ask her to watch Masterchef at 11 pm PST, not so much when it actually means she cant sleep Make sure theres a woman LI tho Make it password protected or something Or some way to keep fb moms out So I looked up what Ossetra caviar was in google for hero And I got this ad today I mean I guess since my Gmail is connected on my laptop it makes sense All of our ultra fans have a higher color role Lu youre an editor now So you will flex as well Weirddddddddd I might have to fix it https://www.buzzfeed.com/lov3lylea/how-well-do-you-know-the-choices-books-and-charact-5wxxqgm6m1 Already spotted something wrong MCs dad in D&D isnt from Grovershire Mc is Brie Larson be trending on Twitter because on a video she said that what shed be doing at 10 years old is looking up how to know if youre gay on Twitter is peak energy It was a question someone sent in Yall Bradshaw and Isabellas last name is Achilles And theyre pretty much undefeated except for one thing Lyra and Isaac Their *Achilles heel* whoever wants to listen to the HSS OG song join jukebox Me, getting ready to meet my bro so he can drop off my shampoo, goes down around the time he should arrive to find out hes been in his hotel in the phone with his rental car place the whole time At least I got some breakfast from the student center I gues Congrats Lu! Regardless of how you do, you showed them how fabulous you are We did We were all in shock that nia lost i still remember how chaotic the choices sub and servers got after that chapter was released Im in class still  Metta youre a mod so youre supposed to be that guy and and its fine They can talk about it without free forming on spoilers like without the tags Ooh thank goodness https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/kzbvet/2020_rchoices_community_survey_results_2_of_4_lis/ Inchresting ...mods are wack Sometimes Theres a difference between a redeemable LI and a person whos given hookup scenes but is a shitty person all around whos family issues justify nothing There are characters who deserved a redemption arc but never got one There are characters who deserved a redemption arc and got one There are characters who didnt deserve a redemption arc and got one And then theres poppy min-nakamura Savannahs backstory was hushed and hyped so much that her running away because she got pregnant was a cop-out If shed just told Bertrand she was pregnant I get that Savannah was young then Though she acts like shes 45 And dresses like it too She has some damn nice dresses But they refuse to let her wear them She at least got to wear dresses that arent her pink outfit Her in AVSP deserved better than Bryce I only accept the head canon that if you dont marry Liam or drake drake and Liam marry Yeah we couldve Especially when both Olivia and Hana could have the surrogacy storyline Though in trh the LIs are pretty one dimensional Hes a break dancing sex machine Tbf theyre all into sex Drake becomes Christian grey in the last diamond scene of TRH3 They shouldve had him on a cover Isnt aerin dead They made a post for what happened with drew but they stayed quiet when the moms went apeshit God the fact that Lin Phaan whatever decided to directly call you out in her story (The spoilers woman) I was disgusted Caution: contains 90% heteronormativity with a shoved in female LI at the end so we can say theres representation That woman is into all the Caucasian males Including the forced LIs Take that (insert Drews name), you big bully  Exact quote^ Right? Shes obsessed with some actor named Marco Linfan Or Nathan One of the two I tried to be neutral about her but then she decided to be that way As long as you dont bash any characters that arent antagonists Well that entire category of discrimination is the worst you can be So you hate people who fear spiders? (Arachnophobe) We say stupid shit but we got each others backs Thats what spoilerland is (Stupid shit in good humor not as in shitty opinions) humor is loved METTA WE HAD THE SAME THOUGHT think alike i remember reading this one fic writer who amongst other things i've noticed as problematic, had the characters get indian food for the hell of it (i think they order up food like you can eat it individually instead of it being family meals) and just the way she kept writing on echaracter one i was like No also this other writer for the same fandom who's writing is *intensely* problematic cultural appropriation some other shit i don't even want to talk about even with spoiler tags and there's like 50+ works for the fandom but they're all basically the exact same content wise i called her out once on the cultural appropriation and she muted me this being one author Wait theres an Indian Cassian? I need a sprite pic The male sprite doesnt really look Indian but I can see why the female one is marked as such God Im guilty of choosing Hispanic sprites the most I avoid using white sprites unless I think theyre the best drawn If theres an Indian MC I choose her no question Off the top of my head Caleb, Zekei, Raf, James, Katherine, And Jackie (MM) may be the only black LIs Ive picked Oh and Zoey They also make even POC LIs whiter if theyre in the cover Remember when both Robin and Sofia were whitewashed in the CH CG Wait no The other one With the tied up hair y'all i need two spell names 1 to restore items to a perfectly functional state and another to restore perfect orderliness I don't want to look up anything latin I came up with a couple, its all good Im not entirely sure Her name is ambiguous and her last name aint a thug. Thing I hated that shes the only one whos not given a last name Damn I thought me, lu and Metta were the best I thought you said seductively and I was like wait what Man it really started with Meta Bias is shit Especially if they dont prove their bias worthy Uh I fight people on the choices sub too No Your last comment was also 39 days ago Hi!

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is its vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin, vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently voracious violation of vivition. The only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbage veers most verbose, so let me simply add it is my very good honor to meet you And you may call me V.

The proper way to take a tequila shot: lick the salt, take the shot, suck on the lime
how to enjoy an alcoholic drink on fire: extinguish the flame with your hand first
the only drinks to ever be drunk: Champagne, Sparkling wine, Sparkling/Apple cider, sparkling water, _whiskey_, mint julep
how to enjoy yourself apparently anywhere: play the "life story" game how could i forget the drink only second tier to whiskey? woe be'est me! i'm being dramatic what the actual fuck pb needs to stop idolizing white/white passing characters while treating POCs like shit in stories OH is one of the *most* diverse casts in the entire game but they throw away *all* of that when making the story center around *one* caucasian character who isn't a bad person but is wayy too forced it's almost like PB forgets that not everyone wants him yeah but they've portrayed multiple storylines involving POC women being treated like the enemy with one white boy who should 've left the story after the softball games i wasn't arguing for or against, just adding another general issue maybe it's not about the POC thing but they specifically choose to make it be especially since it makes 0 sense for harper to be on the diagnostic team you make good points btw  i *wish* there was concrete proof that it isn't racially motivated but a lot of characters done dirty have been POC, namely Black, as of late and female and harper *loves* being a surgeon i admire her willingly choosing to give up a position of power to do what she loves and it makes *no sense* for her to change it metta it's fine yup but her sole goal simply seems to be diagnostics here well surgical seems to be a full time position i don't think you can just do surgeries "on the sides" caseloads are different from surgery it's why there's a whole extra year of residency for surgical residents you're going to have the scheduled surgeries and then you're going to have the emergency ones often times long, may need follow ups, never a set thing i once had a scheduled surgery meant to be for 45 minuts minutes it went on for 3 hours+ these things are unpredictable they did the same shit with zoey kiara even june...kinda they said we sidelined this character for an entire book let's throw her back in coulda given her a mentor role with Bryce but *no* her only storyline in book 2 was showing aurora that she's more than just her niece tbf, sidetracking is me within five mins of doing anything but its abnormal in a high stakes environment Good thing its still day in Merica they really love making whiskey the go to drink mark my words, i will find out just how worthy a whiskey is when i turn 21 those are definitely reasons to have this is that...lance from pokemon yayyyy https://tenor.com/view/captain-america-i-understood-that-reference-look-back-gif-14556485 wait what's the bar name ? in OH\ you had a...campus...bar? i like the virgin version of a strawberry margarita it's essentially a strawberry slushie the closest thing we havve to a college bar is kombucha on tap at our Bistro you become a decent drink at that place/ ? your pre-edit message LMAO Ethan Ramsay definitely went to UCI probably not i think so the residents in OH went to the Ivy's fun fact, Ivy is actually a signification of the athletic division it belongs to Like the nighthawks and stingrays Like bruh The Yankees and Red Sox exist You already used Giants and Rockies But if they wanted to really use a rivalry to make sense of the Wearing the rival shirt, you use giants playing the Dodgers me, not liking potatoes those are the only ones i tolerate fries confuse yeah but they had them as professional teams maybe? there seemed to be a crowd yeah but they were yankee/sox ugly rivalry how 'bout dem apples? cordonia's national motto oof stay safe you got this oh god tik tok the choices fandoms:

Pres:
Also as vp you could've still gave your thoughts and advice to the president and still had the same effect
me  Today at 7:38 PM
but honestly i feel like i never had any real duties as VP this year and i just don't want a repeat of that didn't want to send ss because that would dox him more from the original context:
Pres
Yeah so he applied originally and then took himself off the ballet, but I told him because (new pres) was the only one that applied for VP he would get it if you declined
You declined so I offered it to him because he was on the ballot originally and would have automatically won if he kept it on
me  Today at 7:34 PM
no i get that, i just assumed it would be whoever ran for secretary that would get VP because they were actually voted for
pres  Today at 7:34 PM
Secretary is a different position then VP
If they wanted VP they should've applied because they would've gotten it lol
(new VP) was just iffy on it because he thought he would be busy but I talked to him about it and he changed his mind
but honestly I thought you were gonna take VP ^keep in mind this man knows i already was VP this year Basically the new vp was not on the ballot when voting i miss having the energy to do that i sleep at midnight nowadays Congrats Mara!

I honestly thought thats what it stood for lmao But it sounded so regular They lied probs Thank goodness Still hate that it exists It would be so cool if it was MW2 Since its focused on cult and murders Throwback to when Hero 2 was coming in 2020  Can we come to PB and give them some help with the art Or how they managed a similar art style for ES for THREE BOOKS Yup Fuck romance This was the first week where I paid no diamonds None Im nearly at 200 now Congrats cool kids ! :furballhappy: You are Already upvoted you I am *hyped* for your MTFL review I did the threesome that was fun though short i can't believe it was part of the s*ck n' bl*w scene, without an extra amount of diamonds not really *ever* done in choices Benji should stay the FORK out of QB They should have included a more specific warning for the chapter He is a traumatic character And shouldnt step *foot* into book 2 No Fork is TGPs filter replacement for Fuck So no No spoken Spoon Pb needs to forking stop Mhm ? Damn Also dont ping Mara, shell see it On her own I dont think so but the person notified would appreciate that you took the time to rectify it. A server Im in notifies everyone for every stream, and its quite annoying to see that mention notification Daily Just let them know that you had pinged them but didnt realize that it can be an issue Life 2.0 was good because of the casual friends with benefits thing Story got confusing though I guess after everything with Demi they took it down Mhm technically it was EA before PB separated, but yes
I actually wish EA kept those apps on the store i think the company, Mansingh Transglobal (Which is in ROE and ES) originated from COD right Owen was a cool dude Woah I just saw this, you still playing? Ok I wont be able to message tho other than in the game Just to lyk Crap same code right Pri Black got me Like wtf Yall couldnt have waited for me WAIT FOR ME WHEN YOURE DONE WITH THIS GAME Yunqi lmk when the game ends I cant because Im unable to simultaneously use discord and play Yunqi can you Use Europe and 2 imposters And then let us know the code 10 And sells Skeld* Me too, I just sleep Yee Pri stop killing me next time Yeah thats what I said in announcements If sounds like though that its ||one sided because apparently the dude was told to just stand there with no reaction and the guy who confessed is going to hell|| yesterday definitely seemed *very* eventful yet it all happened last night it has to have been in the original times for it to be a classic or at least have been out for two years i'd be down to replay TC&TF What character? No I mean for TC&TF I know who victor is Hamza from PM, who was made a Hispanic character in RT (not whitewashing but we don't get much rep on S. Asian/Middle Eastern characters) Lena from ACOR, who though used with her proper sprite, is a total nutjob in the reused sprites Hes figured out with his bi-ness tho Oh yea I was Team Zig But I shipped him with Aaron They were very cute Aragon wouldnt really fit zigs name Im cutting this thread off No And dont spam emotes Because Bartie was mentioned twice :CharmanderHi: Separate channel! Well post updates soon Happy birthday! So trr mc would definitely say this when with Hana _ _ Ok yall do not spam istg Probs ooh? where does that show it for you Ohh It like had to refocus itself so Im guessing maybe theyre putting in effort her E This feels off The question Mark situation should have a gap right? Between the  and the name? Holy crap they changed maxwells name But left drake and hanas right Why would they change JUST Maxs name Like Olivias is the same too I dont really know the dialogue but Im going based on a hunch of what I remember from the actual book Looks like diamond outfits dont carry over Oof My Max is treated to this? Guys did you not know That the entirety of the California squad Works at PB? Why do you think we so casually discuss infiltrating @Metta is their accountant Somehow Metta you might wanna bring that up to them and not on the server Real talk tho, if PB was on this server, thered likely be some contempt at the whole scripts thing Were not the only ones that do the script stuff Just were the ones that do this for a community on discord Because we care for yall And we want a healthy conversation server to discuss it all We let our frustrations out here But classy We dont actively bully PB Because were better than that I actually cant with this book A toxic ex kidnaps you And is aided by the queen And diamond choice Dude just divorce her She doesnt get to apologize and be forgiven Honestly this is such BS Wrong gender, hun Princess Fiona  I wanna hot cup of cocoa with a marshmallow or two MW sam definitely has a crush on Cassandra She *definitely* appreciated sam in that premium outfit LARA gala Probably the dinner one too How were all your exams? Im good! Done with finals and all so enjoying my break It was stressful But its over now 1. Kenna Rys 2. Two male, two female - Maxwell, Raydan, Val, Sonia 3. Azura, Everett, Anton 4. Trilogy, action packed, they resolve modern cordonias issues Not sure how thats a comedy... Perhaps because Its comedic That its considered a proper romance I would go to a hotel Check in Just to eat waffles At their continental breakfast Rather than buy that diamond choice I got the update Nothing regarding categories Cliffington Construction company ceo Also had the same house thanks Emi! please take your time with files stuff! I thought Metta picked the profile pic he did for the hell of it Honestly I thought he liked TRH book 1 the best Especially the walker ranch chapters Kamilah? ACOR Outfits were great Plus Lena was the one valid version of her sprite What I dont understand is how the five kingdoms/cordonia went from Magic and blades align To magic in scarcity, deception, and partying To Apples And balls Thats why I said background I think its still regarded as canon tho Since the people are real In the game Im sure the real Kenna was badass So hartfeld gets a lot of revenue just for that name drop Isnt Nathan related to the starlings v Stirrings You guys do know the script is up in #the-apple-obsessed-monarchy right Its now edited so that only 18+ peeps can use it The book is not safe for kids If you are above the age of 18 and have not been give me the time, use #discord-suggestions-and-requests and request for it They really love NYC for a company that exists in California SF was three years ago Its pm always East coat Coast Or cordonia Give us a California book PB That isnt stereotyped Another one Thats not a mainstream city Mc needs to go to T4 in Dublin You dont want to know lol what he said We arent trashing the east coast Were just tired of all the love it gets from Pb I want MC to go to MSJHS Have t4 Complain at the work environment it's legit what MSJHS Is the environment is highly competitive which makes it extremely toxic and there's a t4 near mhm it was part of the summer book and nantucket in Witsdhifkadja Lu I will spoil the winner of a season for you ah yes during the "travels" of BB2 or 3 also PM2 just being all over the place THE WINNER IS IVY FISHER I Introduced her to masterchef and we're watching season 8 together but she's watching the first few seasons so i said i'd spoil the winner of the season but i didn't say what season and for what show it actually shouldn't be taking NSFW chat stars wtf Wait where is marigold from Oh And her face is used for WHite RT MCs mom Thank you omg!! RT was a good story We love when two sisters rise up against the capitalist society They rose against the tides of oppression Normally they will be more honest They keep saying ROD is in the works First action Getting Mona out of jail It really speaks to the whole thing with IG versus Diacord Where we see all these requests for TNA2 I guess they had to make both LIs a problem Because making one the savior would make it easier Like I said I like isobel but appearance wise I dont think any of them are LI worthy I hope this is a free option ~~Or did she come back a while ago~~ Damn novas been quite for a while Hmm I hope the slowly more active members stay active To meet Pri and her chaos @Priyudi wanna join the chaotic crew Pri you better stay off of spoilerland to study No Its still distracting ~~Also no one noticed the server name change anyway~~ It wont be helpful And sign you up for hashcode ~~now theres a new chaos~~ The admins have lined up their chaos Tatsu is weird Thats the mc free wedding dress for BaBu2 Deciding Mcs final person is apparently deciding their lifelong commitment Apparently that dress hugs her curves (the premium one) ~~The only message we deleted was Time for Teletubbies!~~ Still not sure how you can pull the top off and then the bottom off of a one piece swimsuit... It made sense with the two piece But they really wanted to make us feel bad for not buying an outfit Ahhhh ~~I forgot that existed~~ Weve got two OG chaos fam members back ~~were only missing one authoritative figure~~ Authoritative = administration You scrolled so far up firework You definitely saw it Priya wth Ugh the Sofia posts got second in my category The vote is rigged Im positive half the shit makes no sense for normal choices people The people in my category had a high number of upvotes I was up there but not by a few hundred So no matter how blechy the posts were that won (The witness weird drawing, the Sofia edits, and the gossip girl/the T thing) They still had more upvotes than me People ranked favorite continuing books as OH2, TRH3, and third TRH2? Even the trash storytelling that was TRH3 was more developed than OH2 Also Emi, how was your explanation an unpopular opinion? You were legit stating the facts Three chapters when the entirety of the book before and after was mediocre does not redeem a book The Sofia post won in at least two categories gdi bel I dont have a leather jacket in On And ofc one of the mods who was nominated won a category She didnt give off her badass vibes with that redesign They softened the smile He no longer wears the katana while shirtless  I think in BB3 he doesnt really either What *didnt* you do is the question Honestly gore aint great the only books it makes sense in is the books regarding mystery and such I mean Who wouldnt (If you were into women) If not you dont need to simp Did you tell them about the 500 knives she carries And his stern yet sexy eyebrows The randomest posts get me leveled up Hold up Blood Is red? This is blasphemy And immortal blood is golden Which autocorrected to Biden but I fixed it Priya? Wrf Wtf Oooh Can you stream this ||so|| I wonder if you can manipulate the code to start at a random chapter ||for fun|| Come to VC Pri TE:WP and my phone, pretty likely tbh but also my calculator though that's more in front of me nothing tangible, other than hss being pb's first game and TF being choice's first story Np Remember when that happens in LH I know the right answer but its fun to pick the wrong ones Also the ones where you flirt with anyone and everyone Priya My only memory of vine? Whats 9 plus 10? 21! You stupid Also DAMN DANIEL #media-not-related-to-choices pls #media-not-related-to-choices Love you Pri in a very platonic way ~~At least the fandom had nova for a while~~ Thats why she had full outfits That arent that one Im sure that Pb knows more than they let on Theres a chance they know about spl too But we dont let the info get out of the server Im sure my 500 replays of blades to get the best scores before the book finished contributed to its sequel (Because I spent many diamonds and kept replaying so I played the scenes) I am not going to let go of specific, LI only scenes because they matter to me. I am not going to play games within games to get choices to change because of some analytic. Remember that this is *just* a game. And its not going to harm you to take a break or *only* read good books. The weight of a good quality book is on no ones shoulders. If it was, Blades would have changed the game. Okay BIG FUN FACT this is NOT THE CHANNEL for this discussion This channel is for spoilers, not for spoiling the games analytics. Emi. Youre gaslighting. Dont make people feel bad for how they play. You say youre not but that is *exactly* what you are doing. This server is NOT the audience you need to go off on. Theres just a lot that happened here Also I had no idea side stories didnt count Someone get me coffee please Its there but its too far away from my bed Highly appreciated worst angry faces in choices Tyler and James also he isn't an ass to people imo, the best antagonist was Anton Severus you could actually feel the betrayal he was like Duffy but gave less hints the most obvious one: "If you can breathe, you can stand, and if you can stand, you can fight" if they ended TRR there, it would've been a high note book 1 was pretty tame, with the  antagonists being the fellow competitors and sort of Tariq book 2, you see that Constantine is the biggest villain, but it still isn't a major thing with the direct assassination attempts of book 3, it shows you from the get go that this is escalated, but fits in with the slowly progressively antagonistic theme TRH's villains were all so predictable TRR redeemed some villains by making them allies and dismissed others hence the channel name Im a Maybug @Priyudi :marafrogemoji: Everyone was replying to you I had to tell them youre not there anymore And now youre on Choices LGBTQIA+ Yeah, Bees Ill message it to you There was never any arguing If it was just one person It would be situational But it happens in *all* his books I bet if Morgan was red headed shed go through it in WB too Also, were not specifically pointing to women And neither is the post It says *grudge* against *gingers* You did Also Probably Were pointing towards his trend And general way of women getting bad situations In his writing Also Brians a douche and if you really paid attention thats not what the conversation was about Yes, we shouldnt accuse anyone of misogyny unless theyre blatant Were just speaking of a pattern Pri this isnt tea spilling zone lmao truth so....................... check my memes #twilight-but-team-jacob They said Theres only one Jen allowed at Pb Theres only 2 jens allowed at Pb One writes toxic males The other writes never ending sagas What did he work on? What the Yeah I havent seen the scripts either That she does But I figure that shes more about getting content to her followers as soon as possible She likely cares more about giving people the file pictures rather than the scripts We take time Which I think is a good thing Ah Inchresting Watermarking is so ridiculous Like A. Its not fan made content B. Its not *your* content I only tolerate her account because  I can see the full body sprites Her obsession with Marco Linfan is rather creepy They had HSS in the wrong place then I fixed it I think bees editing will reveal more once its done Kio, prayer circle -> #choices-prayer-circle Maybe she blocked? She blocked me but jokes on her I have a second account DJ KHALED Well MLF has some bad takes The point is that theyre not good people And yes That account is going too far But its not that bad if you're going to be homophobic you don't deserve appreciation she's presented somewhat problematic opinions in the past we keep our spoilers as unbiased as we can if she can do the same, kudos to her ooh also Kio what's your profile pic that's very cool hmm maybe if i want to commission something for my wattpad profile picture i'm using my old one temporarily the purple one with the glasses yeah this one ooh i see wait what is the cost? i see https://instagram.com/plejaades?igshid=16j9t0gfvjfty No problems i think they used ES's bg for it The moment we knew mw2 wont exist When they used Sams hair Also for the twins aunt in class act Every sprite except for one has the same outfit And then one has the BB default blue jacket outfit I think they just used Hispanic WEH mom I think they have a very strict editing thing The wiki Ive heard They also say Teja is Indian for X while Desai is Sanskrit for X Use the actual language WIKIA #emi Bulbapedia is the superior wiki Also Zeldapedia Like that huge Harry Potter website that was like the HP encyclopedia But Rowling sued them for some reason Probs something else They like spam the recent release as the bg Like foreign affairs distracts me https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Harry_Potter_Lexicon They chose an unfortunate POC Pic* Its way too close to a negative acronym Also something - apparently indigenous people want to reclaim the term Indian (my friend was talking about it, dont quote me) Which I think is important to reclaim your own identity and all But as an actual Indian American it is already a problem when thats how indigenous people are described (and is confusing) and the two other terms help bring a distinction Like its gotten to the point where there was a post where someone said dont call yourself Indian if youre not indigenous! And someone had to reply with the map of India ...I still think that automatically Like this one character in Zoeys extraordinary playlist Who is the same state ethnically as me in India  and he calls the POCs at the company BIPOC but as one word and I keep thinking he said as bi people of color because he gives bi vibes oh that wasn't necessarily a bad thing his character is slightly extra and potentiall bi that's really cool OMG haha my cousin's on again/off again gf is more responsive than *he* is and like i'm the one he's most communicative with that is definitely interesting THAT SONG IS A BOP yep they look sculpted but not the good kind ' why make one sprite so oily? both are cool but carter isn't a realistic drawn sprite so the body doesn;t fully work Does my wattpad writing experience count Ill have you know I have 27k+ reads on my first completed story your favorite band broke up? Zoey had like 2 diamond scene And no hookup in the last chapter They probably rely on Andrew shvartz to make decisions He approves every bad decision And then when someone suggests ginger female LIs have a good time Hes like NAH Except how Nias storyline went, BOLAs ruled Also Imtura almost being nonexistent i thought it was like a clasp Yes but it can slide around God choices fans can be assholes If youre going to critique something do it on a post explicitly made by PB, Jesus i'm curious what it was this time maybe the wedding post from before Could be But theyve known about her for a while i've always said she needs to get out of the fandom for her own sake because insta fandom is not healthy Lmao I predicted that shed be back overnight Hey, do you think you can remove the image?
