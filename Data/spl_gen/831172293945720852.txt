I love the channel namesssss Whoa... This is a big noticw .......weirdddd Yea there have been things like
What if PB made a Greek mytho book... It's finee That's just life You ain't a true choices fan until you took a certain meme too seriously and nearly got a heart attack Sooo this really is dividing the fandom sadly That's also true Been with them since SHS (that was also PB , not completely but yea)

And then HSS ltime


And i guess its probably my tendecny to stick till im hurt very bad and toxic optimism that i still feel like its all gonna be alright 

Plus its not all bad... Right.. Do we not have tch channel? I was thinking of suggesting TCH to be named as Adulterated Howl's moving castle.. Hopefully these ads bring us more adventure and thrill loving fans. Same.
