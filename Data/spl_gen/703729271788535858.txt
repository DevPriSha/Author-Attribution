I prefer OTT just for that reason Even youtube is getting toxic with all these wannabe reviewers who seem to only want to put their agenda out there It's been years since I saw that show can't remember But couple seasons are good Critiquing is fine but with no personal bias to it There is one reviewer on youtube who on pretext of reviews only spreads hate Yeah I do that too, but I report those videos as well  She should be flexible LMAO Maybe 3..quick intro, why you think deserve the scholarship, how would it help you in your academic and professional goals in future.
