Hi y'all Trying my hand at making a souffle for dinner Wish me luck Yes ma'am will do Hoping it's more of the former than the latter Update: it looks pretty good actually!! The real star of my dinner is this grilled chicken I made though I seasoned with soy sauce, creole seasoning, and some other various spices and it. Is. Juicy. It was pretty good! I think I used a dish that was too large bc it cooked a bit too much for my tastes though "Sam's eyes darken intensely... +Aku" Idk if anyone else uses this but if you don't...I promise it makes diamond mining that much easier Period!! TNA and AVSP talking shit about TRF's 104904 diamond outfits and choices You'd think it'd be considered more relevant overall since the uproar it got over not getting a sequel sksksk But ig most of the people who even took part in that uproar kinda moved on to the next book? Hey hurricanes are no joke, it's totally understandable if you need to take some time away Please stay safe though (assuming you're talking about hurricane Fred) I'm ngl I haven't been keeping tabs on the Atlantic hurricane season as much as I should But I understand your nerves, even if you don't have a full landfall a tropical storm can still make some waves literally and figuratively Oh yeah in FL you probably have better chances Sorry, I know I'm stating the obvious Best of vibes coming your way No problem sksks, hurricane alley people have to stick together Good morning :) I want power  Okay so Ngl this is part storytelling and part ranting Today was much more stressful than last year's move in Logistics I actually have a single room so no roommate thank god Just so much stress from packing to unpacking to the fucking heat today And get this They blocked off the main roads to campus and built detours to "keep traffic down" But all they did was make traffic worse and make it confusing too So I had to leave in the middle of unpacking bc the table we got was the wrong size and it was just too hard to put together It was hell getting back bc of the traffic directing Keep in mind this is all happening in North Carolina heat The high today was 88F Wait are you from NC? Oh yes you understand Very very bad And bc of how my dorm is built you're outside for a while going to and from your room It's suite/apartment style so the interior of the building is kinda built like a large balcony But that's the cons, time for the pros and then I promise I'm done unloading Well for starters I'm in a single room but I share a bathroom with my suite mates/neighbors and they seem nice enough Also I love my room setup I'll show you *cackles in surrounded by underage drinking at uni* Oh y'all wanna talk about bad handwriting Wait until I get to my dorm Well maybe not bad, just weird I'm stuck deciding between working and wrapping it up for the day But workaholism No This is schoolwork Y'all I'm in my dorm It's online assignments and homework I'm not in a classroom But alas Workaholism THIS Omg I love coloring my hair I haven't dyed it tho I use hair paint waxes Not with hair wax you don't  By dark don't they mean brown Mission failed: kept working https://c.tenor.com/TVHi2b3W3TYAAAAM/anguish-despair.gif Update I've freed myself @Belbercike I'm gonna stream the life of Bella Bia in VC soon if you wanna join And everyone else heyyy come see me stream or something Yes  k live now So for those of y'all who weren't in the Sims stream We collaboratively made a Beau from LOA lookalike Tremble before him I'VE LEVELED UP BY THE POWER OF HIMBEAU This is so powerful A groundbreaking moment Do y'all think if I post Himbeau on r/choices that they'll like it skssks Me @ mara over beau

Aloeza (aloe vera)
Ecchy (Echeveria)
Angie II (ghost plant, metal pot)
Aida (houseleek)
Hieroplant Green (Christmas cactus) And my 4 resurrection plants Omg there are a lot of A's I just realized There's lore about the names too lmaooo Angelighost, Aloeza, and Ecchy are puns based on the plant types and the Schuyler sisters from the musical Hamilton (Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy) Angie 2 is named that bc it's technically a "clone" that I propagated from Angelighost Also a pun on Audrey II from little shop of horrors Aida is from the musical of the same name (which was my obsession at the time of getting the plant) And hieroplant Green is a play on words from the character hierophant green from an anime I watch Pretty much all you need to know Abt the Hamilton reference is that there are 3 characters with those names and the plants are named after them sksksks Thank you saksksk I just kinda go with what comes to me at the moment Random question Do y'all like firm or silken tofu better I've never tried it unfortunately :( Silken tofu acquired feeling like streaming while playing something tonight, would y'all like to tune in Oops  I'm sorry I was streaming in another server I'm ready to get on now tho One moment Kk come on in Good morning How are you Getting ready for another day of studying on the weekend Curry Can I just say Shoutout to all of the cultures that have variations curry in their cuisine.

Idk but that's what the question seems like based on how it was worded But let me not speak for someone else ^^ For a somewhat looser comparison Kinda like people from US states believing if they're from a certain region I.e. people from Florida aren't ALWAYS considered culturally southern despite geographic location Is that was you mean Oh Well I stand corrected Ohhh I see ~~ignore my embarrassing myself~~ But also interesting ngl I'm sorry let me just https://c.tenor.com/y1ODArE94o4AAAAM/bye-disappointed.gif This is what we call "Frat missing the point" Lmao this is wildly off topic but it just happened so I'm shocked I've become a regular at this breakfast place on campus and it's to the point that the morning shift cashier knows what I want She *had it ready for me* 2 seconds after I walked in Something similar happened to me with Starbucks last semester Same deal, the cashier knew my drink and was ready to make it when I walked in :megadrian: HAPPY BIRTHDAY Evil Bel: Ew old men Evil Mara: ping me Evil Aku: my full name means "disgust" +Aku Evil Sam: I respect professional boundaries Evil Frat: I play ROE4 for the enjoyment Evil PM MC: I'm a reserved monogamist Evil Rheya: I hate my daughter who is still alive and well Do we have a shit post/spam channel lmao Evil Kio: Josephine is such a peaceful character to RP as EVIL FRAT DKEKEKEKRKR Evil Josephine: *keeps you warm and dry* Evil Bastien: consent  Evil Gabe Ricci: My touch is insulated and not at all conductive to electricity Evil Martin: I'm a team player MILG Mother I'd like to get (to know) Greetings SJDNDODJ @Belbercike But replace muscle with grey haired men The muscle part is def me tho *MORE LI'S WITH THE BASTIEN BODY PB* Oh also bel do you wanna VC today Yass I'll be right there Reflectivity?

We won't stop complaining until it gets one!" And then *proceeds to drop the issue in the next month until the next success standalone* Literally watched this happen *specifically* with DS *AND* FA And without implying much The results of the "which of these customizable LIs did you choose" polls on Wikia are very telling People always complain about blonde male LIs being forced, but guess what the most popular customizable LIs usually are Pls no I dipped my toes in Tumblr choices once I have not returned There's just...so *much* But what's all is I keep hearing about Facebook fandom Ngl imagine if someone did a writeup of choices drama on r/hobbydrama People would be up in arms either way WTF We're alive "I hope FA fails"

"Lmao this app is dying, so shitty" Also idk about y'all but I feel like the issue of GOC partially stems from people self inserting so much I can play as a female MC and I don't see it as myself.

Why would they respond to negative comments and give more fuel to the fire BOTH ~~Should we even get into how Asian men aren't seen as masculine in media bc racism~~ This discourse really is a tea party I will personally be enjoying a cup of chai Valid, we can save that for later "HAVE Y'ALL SEEN DANNY DEVITO DO AEGYO OMGGGG" [Redacted by kpop managers] "Tom Holland is the maknae of the MCU " I regret this statement Lu pls No. Let's go!

I feel like since QB is kinda centered on a rivalry between MC and a "big bad" it only makes sense to redeem her if they introduce a "bigger bad" y'know Which is pretty much what they did in TRR with Olivia, MC, and Madeleine now that I think about it Speaking of QB can I just say it seems weird that they don't mention MC's potential exposure of poppy's parents all that much Other than a few quick jabs about how she's lost part of her allowance It seems like it'd be a very impactful thing that's (in my memory) kinda glossed over in QB2 Greetings to you all +Fan Language -Romance Beats me Soooo, that's me on a college textbook y'all I didn't even know they used the photo the textbook until my friend found the book The original photo is from an article Long story short a photographer saw me studying in the library and asked if he could take some pics for an article I said yeah sure and the article turned out to be something I literally had nothing to do with lmaoo The headline Girl I knowww DiVeRsItY Literally just included a pic of me for being POC LMAOOO No but people speed up when I walk behind them sometimes (no joke) I've found the silver lining in that micro aggression tho I walk fast anyway so if they speed up then good Life at a PWI is definitely interesting sometimes For anyone who doesn't know PWI means predominantly white institution Valid I feel like I psych myself out on campus thinking people are staring at me (long story) My gripe is that at my college a lot of the student body looks like people that used to bully me lmaooo So it def makes you paranoid that you're being stared at for being different or something by everyone even if they're just minding their business Oh also not to mention the fact that some of these people prob haven't interacted with a black person who doesn't fit within their stereotype sooo A few times I've seen people kinda shoot me looks like they don't know how to handle/process me Like sorry Aiden and Ethan, I'm not gonna let you say the n word and tell you where to find some weed It's the opposite on our campus They try *so* hard to adopt AAVE sometimes I've heard white guys that probably grew up in the country like I did speaking with a heavy blaccent Ig they think it's cool? Idk. 
Plus party culture on campus means a *lot* of trap music so ig that influences it too *YIKES* It's so funny because the some of same people that blast trap music from their lifted pickup trucks are the ones who openly fly trump and confederate flags Consume the media and culture but continue harming the people giving it to you  sounds about right The ghetto It's a whole multi paragraph story I'd prefer not to get into (not bc it's super scarring but just bc it's long) but uh

None. It's forecast to fall later today But la preemptive measures from la uni  *Perish* No I'm saying I'm jealous And the worst part is it's not even pure snow that's forecast It's a WinTrY MiX In other words snow, sleet, and freezing rain Sleet cream  Oh right I forgot sksks Long story short in the south we have this thing called snow cream Literally just natures version of a snow cone Set out a bowl before it's forecast to snow, collect said snow, ass sweetened condensed milk, vanilla, etc Oh noooo never off the ground https://www.food.com/recipe/southern-snow-cream-113172 Why didn't the link work smh Weird, I thought discord recognized them without C'est la vie This is pretty much it but ignore the part where it says you can use fresh "clean" snow from the ground Do not.

>Perfect. Let's go!
Not quite right A billboard? PERRY'S BILLBOARD?  Honestly I didn't even know about this shit until I saw their Instagram post Atp I just stay here for the stories LMAOO The inner drama tired me out like a year ago I remember back when it was a huge deal that bb2 was being released after such a wait It feels like now any sort of critique turns into an uproar Or maybe it was always like that and my newbie rose tinted glasses are off Idk Well... That's sumn to unpack on its own And self insertion Like the people who dislike certain character and book aspects not because they're necessarily bad but because they can't see themselves in it Or how the (very valid) Forced LI debate gets so heated because people see their MC as themselves and feel like a "forced" LI is being forced into them as a person and not a character !!! I understand the desire for representation but the gender locked debate get so heated too It's so funny The same people being homophobic toward a wlw shipped character are the same ones who call every blond male LI gross and forced sometimes Now that's an interesting topic Ellen from WT, Aurora from OH, Scarlett from VOS Let Sofia and MC gatekeep and gaslight together The fact that choices has its own repeating tropes and idiosyncrasies makes me chuckle "LI smiles, but it doesn't quite reach their eyes" Oh Sebastian was camp Persephone Dalton in reverse I want to play as a villain tbh The fandom would riot Marc- nvm Bite your tongue BITE YOUR TONGUE ABOUT MAL Mal deserves ALL THE STEAM MOTY daughter deserves the world and a sequel Oops No fae I saw your point I just saw the opportunity to make a Mal joke Girl that was *camp* I was cackling "DAE think the one off scene where you could make Jax and Adrian kiss was queerbaiting " Even tho it was never said that either of them were straight and tbh I'd be shocked if 2 centuries/decades old vampires remained straight Looks at the black customizable LIs being last in most popularity polls Looks at the black customizable MCs being fucking gorgeous and still being last in said polls Take one look at black male BOLAS/DS MC and tell me he isn't beautiful Wikia too And a sprinkle of Instagram Mara Pls confirm HELP LMAOOOO Rafael deserved the world I think they're saying Ethan would support BLM as if there aren't POC present People kinda warp supporting BLM into "not being racist" That's what the phrase was meant as I believe !!! Let's talk about that About how it's your own people who invalidate your status as your race and ethnicity Because you don't fit a mold Some of us talk like that Okay Metta So glad we could have this discussion Did someone say...*spin* The original without music is better but I have to compress it first Sorry voltra but are you giving *Beyonce realness* in a bathrobe while doing those 23 one leg spins? Didn't think so sweaty xx  When I made that video I never realized how hypnotic the little flick of the wrist I do when I spin is For that I'd need to have competition first  Me walking towards voltra to challenge her Oh no I was fully joking I can't dance for shit Oddly enough I can do a split though It's the weirdest thing, I have little coordination but my legs are hyperflexible A JoJo reference?

America in terms of how *exactly* they form and what effects they cause but the basic gist is fronts + big storm Moving to #and-now-for-something-different in my weather thread And on  street at that *But not off mine* :wokeuplikethis: Y'all omg Diamond mining while studying is a game changer I just went from like 180 gems to 231 in the course if a few days I've incorporated the auto clicker into my downtimes Like when I'm getting ready to leave my dorm in the mornings I'll mine a little bit when I'm washing my face or doing something where I can just let it click Forbidden love  So Treasure trove of reactions Kk I'm sorry Good morning Y'all omg For the first time in months my diamond balance is over 300 ~~By tomorrow this probably won't last but oops~~ Eli hands down The only team to be on Exactly exactly We love the grumpy slow burns WHY IS MY NAME EVIL FART LAYHURS- Wow Et TU brute Not to talk shit but to talk shit Wtf kind of poll is this OSNSODD WHAT'S EVEN THE POINT Y'all omg I was listening to kpop and this random Thai song came up in the autoplay It's honestly a bop Favorite by Loona They are a rare clan Hello How dare you Seasoned older lady casually takes a drag of a cigarette while on the phone and says "oh imma do that anyway...imma do that anyway cause that's how I am" I shall fall asleep after I finish this lovely dip I made Cream cheese + sour cream + Sriracha, garlic powder, and chili and lime seasoning It's *so* good Ice eating you say? That looks good aku Speaking of geography It's fun seeing places in the US named after European places Obviously we know why they're named that way but it's fun to point out Ex: there's a city in North Carolina not too far from me called New Bern https://c.tenor.com/Aumj3r7FA8wAAAAM/ariana-grande-sassy.gif Not to mention Durham, NC in Durham County, NC 8$;_(_!_?

Ok yay First up is Jockeys Ridge, an area the outer banks that resembles a desert despite being right next to the Atlantic ocean The sand dunes in this area of NC like the ones you see here are considered crucial for preserving the unique topography and wildlife of the area Next up, Cape Lookout lighthouse NC is home to 7 lighthouses, some of which are still functional, some of which are record holders, and all of which are nationally protected historical sites Cape Lookout is honestly my favorite because well...just look at the paint job Greetings all How's it going Adam I can feel insomnia creeping in tonight and it's only 11 Hey, just asking if it's ok to recreate my weather thread?

I have something to do at 5 but I can explain what happened over VC better than I can type it Kk one sec Welcome Y'all, one of the pitfalls of being a meteorology major just happened today My professor cancelled class due to severe weather Not because of some university issued safety warning But because she works at a news station and is busy due to severe weather She's a queen tbh She's a broadcast meteorologist and a prof (obviously) but she's also really young Oh and did I mention Impeccable style This is literally what MC would get a 25 option for if we had a broadcast meteorologist book Y'all omg God bless my one Prof For this week's assignment students can resubmit ANY previous assignment for a new grade, or if you're happy with your grade, just write in the assignment text box saying "I have no assignment to resubmit/I choose not to resubmit" ...I have a 100 in her course so far So I have an entire week without a class  This is so ideal Now I can focus on my other 2 courses that really need some attention Hello hello hello How art thou Bored Long story short I've been understimulated by schoolwork this week I might stream tbh Yes exactly I'm so used to having more work than I do this week I heard earthquakes and came Natural phenomena are related to meteorology so therefore I feel drawn  Throwback to the time I considered coming out on April fool's day and just...not going back in Well y'all Amen I love subtracting 12 all the time But also y'all I just wanted to say (this is entirely unrelated) I'm doing a little stream later today and the theme is "frat is heavily under the weather" Feel free to tune in if/when it happens Oop?

And then the people who will (rightfully and validly) express their interest for books centered on other POC, which is okay on its own, but dragging down this book in the process "Oh so we can get this but not x minority book " Or even worse the "oh so we can get this but not a customizable MC and GOC LI sequel to most wanted " And honestly I don't even mind the genderlock because let's be real even in the world of choices where many MCs are female, POC women don't get as much of a spotlight it seems?

I'M READY FOR ID Hey y'all, guess what I stumbled across About 2 years ago I made a trivia quiz to name all the series released by PB under a time limit. I just found the quiz again and updated it so I thought I'd share https://www.sporcle.com/games/williamsaaron200/pixelberrys-choices-stories-you-play-book-quiz I just got 47/63 on my first updated playthrough lmao *All series shown have at least partially released for all players (non-VIP) as of today so no MAH or SB Indeed LMAOOO My impact  Although next time you battle on VC about it let me know, I'm down Hot take In a perfect world, Tony Kowalski and Lewyn would be LIs instead of antagonists Thoughts? Agreed on WTD but I'm torn between THM or ACOR THM has wiles and strategy in droves and is exceptional at delegation ACOR MC is just as cunning and iirc she's good with a dagger isn't she Why thank you Bloodbound? Y'all omg I've been so mf busy I forgot MAH wide released  True Meanwhile I'm also still on chapter 11 of TNA4 *TNA3 Ignore that, I'm totally not from the future where TNA gets a 4th book That would be crazy....right? The holiday affair But slightly hot take It feels like they've been trying to find their next TRR series for some time now and imo it seems like they're banking on it being TNA I guess this means my old meme came true I do I see it honestly Now if only the new TRR could be LOA or COP But actualky no If they were popular idk if I could call them "the new TRR" bc of the difference in genre and vibe Yeahhh I got bored with TPS But I should probably think more about what constitutes the "new TRR" that sets the concept apart from other books/contenders I'm thinking about qualities like
Romance based

Involving an every(wo)man MC who has little notable identity before the story begins

Potentially lucrative, plenty of gem choices centered around experiences/scenes with characters and outfits rather than collectible items and information

A hit with the general public and a plot that doesn't necessarily wrap itself up in one book I kinda brainstormed these criteria now but they seem to hold water when we look at TNA and SR The only thing they're both missing that TRR had is an ensemble of diverse side characters who get their own "lore" and time to shine The taste level here is high Black MTFL Noah getting some well deserved love with his fine ass
