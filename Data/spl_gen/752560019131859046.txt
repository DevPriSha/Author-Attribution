Priceless expressions :dogewink: :dogewink: :OOF:  Hi Rayven, I know we haven't talked as much and we don't know each other well but may I ask a few questions? In case you do decide to go through college and let's assume you graduate, what are your plans after getting a degree? I mean think about it a little. Think of all the options you may have once you get your degree that won't be possible in case you drop. Are those options worth struggling in college? If no, then dropping out is a good option Ahh sorry about that, my computer can be a bit of an arse sometimes.

Anyways, if you feel like taking a break, why not consider taking a year long gap then if you feel like it, go back to college to complete your degree. Because in my opinion, its better to plan ahead and think of all the possibilities and consequences before taking a concrete decision You can talk to your college counselor about it and they can explain it to your parents What is better - you get a job 3 years later than your peers or you destroy your mental health?

You can end up taking a loan in case you have financial troubles. And you can pay them once you get a job. I know it isn't the ideal solution but its still something.

You can also power through this year, graduate and live your life on your terms. Though if you feel like its too much and not worth it. (again, consider what will you do in case you end up graduating or you end up dropping out of college altogether) you know yourself better than anyone else, even your parents yes you just have to think a little and be honest with yourself its okay to be scared at times. College can be daunting, especially if you are studying things you have no interest in you won't know unless you try I am sorry to hear that. Maybe try talking to the college counselor then? They are equipped to deal with stuff like these and have experience with similar issues I am sorry but I didn't get what the above message means  oh no. Bashing your head is no option. You have to think logically instead of giving in to your current emotions it isn't. I get that it looks tempting but trust me, pain is never the option Let's say pain is an option (which again, it isn't). What do you think will it achieve? Will it graduate you? Will it get you a job? Will it make you happy? Will it make your voices to your parents be heard? Well I hate to break it to you but the answer to all of them is actually no. I had a friend with abusive parents. They attempted TW||suicide||. That attempt made their parents look at them and ask what's wrong. Sounds like a happy ending? Well, they told their problems and it looked like things were solving, they were taken to a therapist and things looked to be okay. Fast forward to one month later, things returned back to normal along with the parents pining the kid about the therapy expenses and how they are spending money for the kids' happiness. The kid wasn't happy. The therapy wasn't working at all. The parents only supported in terms of money and despite the various requests by the therapists to the parents to participate, they never cared enough and never bothered to do their part. Since the therapy didn't work, the parents decided to take the kid off of therapy since they thought it was utter waste of money. A few months later, the kid felt ||suicidal|| again. The parents didn't bother thinking the kid is pretending or is just *whining* about their new school. So, at the end of the day, nothing was achieved with the numerous ||self-harm|| attempts other than few minutes of empathy. The kid is still depressed and unfortunately as much as I or my other friends want to help, we cannot do anything other than hear them out and show that we are there for them. https://tenor.com/view/why-not-both-gif-11478682 t!wallet I'm sorry I thought this was #bots-and-pets-uwu
