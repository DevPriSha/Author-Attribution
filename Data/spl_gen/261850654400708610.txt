Romance books bad. upvotes to the lefT) comics subreddits are the worst ive had some weird shit messaged to me oof ive also had men hit on me which was hilarious im just like yknow what a lesbian is yea they really do not but i generally just get weirdo comments because of being a mod on r/nba nkjnlkknklnjkljn so many i still find it funny when people recognize me outside reddit like YOURE ELBENJI I LOVE YOUR SHIT and im like jkdsfkljdlskjflkdsj HOW DO YOU RECOGNIZE ME ye i am well my name is benicia and ppl give you less shit when you make your nickname masculine on the internet it was my older 'do not harrass me' handle in gaming before i made it beeaggro but nope not recently skjkdlj god that was wild but yea thats why we do some rules aw as long as youre not rda we gucci asdlkfjadjf omg speaking of apps secrets moved to scripts its still insane to me how its basically 90% lesbian stuff now birb thats what i do got a whole bag in the freezer did we ever talk about this? lkfjdjlkjkljfdsklgjklj me too poppy love is too strong better mc das right i love how the wish we were and deserved better got all the girls the dream would be boston latin i hate this   i like my thirst to be on the LOW thank you the _low_ it is im cold lu cmere im cold and no ones home get off work all the girls are short and poppys even shorter kamilah i think bianca yea makes poppy so tiy lol i show those in class sometimes njhbgvcfhvbjknm yes :Anti_Ethan: daslkjfjdlkjlkdk i will fight for u aw m;lknjbhvgcfhvjbknlm, thats fair yea beckett is fine as a friend he just needs to get his abs outta my gay face dont do hot yoga in front of me im not buyinggg my face is shreya only parking ye mdakfladjsjkkljdf i will continue writing my dissertations on gay :toughchu: no one can stop me :toughchu: oh firework wow who were they i dont even remember i dont know you k bye the spam is there cause itd look dead otherwise  dlskajfsdkljf firework a true og like why must i bother with peasants we love a firework aw yesh ok pls awwww daskjfldsjaflj i miss norcal ;; i lived there half my life  kjsdlaflkjkldsfkl i lived in berkeley i was born in SF my dad was a prof at UC Berk yay! we really out here in the shondaverse ok of the classic books I only have MW and D&D left are there any books that people want to see a review of that would be considered classics uhhhhhhh i should make a list all the VIP books AME, TRR, ES, TCATF, ACOR OH BOLAS ROD, VOS, IL TF yesh  fcghiuojlhgfgchgvjkjbhvjk LMAO thank you <# they get madddd ;; and umm theres more Hero, RoE, THOBM MOTY THM BB TE, PM and yea thats all now ooo yes D&D has been on my backburner for a long time mostly because my review is just so succinctly parsons good everything else meh i did TFS did HSS skdjfljds forgot that one it is I def should do a plat review bless b nkml,; thatll be when i do my shit series hmmm maybe true ^ people go up in arms about whatsername abby? from TF? people despise her ooo pls i would love to pls sleeping bags  but oof moose scare me theyre SO BIG https://old.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/j4qco2/a_lesbian_reviews_the_instant_classics_queen_b/? I'm a queen adsjfljasdflj omg its the thing but yea thats why its there with episode we dont have a functional lesbian i vote just say fuck it and put Highway Blossoms or like dynasty scans yea storyscape was super straight it was actually a little annoying she really is (also BB i strongly believe is a book that is completely fucked over by the LIs, it would be much better without them imo) dlksjfklj i put this in my review! the problem for me with BB is that they work so much better like as characters but as soon as it becomes about them being into MC the book just slows to a crawl instead of just letting them exist the romanced is essentially tacked in and kills the vibe oh ;; hey i have an aesthetic :uwuu: but also damn people reallllyyyy are going hard on that i dont think acor is a masterpiece so many 'thats your opinion man' and its like SO IS THE ABOVE YOU yeeeesh its like i kicked their dog im laughing ACOR MC is great ACOR had cool aesthetics everything else in it makes me die inside eh not even that it was inaccurate as hell where was brutus octavian cleo's role is completely downplayed and it relies on a lot of mysoginistic troppings with cleo not to mention the rampant misogyny, how much marc sucks when marc was not a douchebag historical marc was more like a chill frat boy its straight up real people fic yea well he is one of shakespeares things ....yes and no we dont know how much of it is true or octavians propaganda because octavian and him were entrenched in a long, long war im just like bitch i am the truth teller i could go harder on marc but basically octavian needed him to be both this vicious opponent but also this roman hero so he could legitimize his war and his imperial takeover so he could compare himself to his dad and paint Marc as his Pompey so accuracy is hazy kinda like how caligula probably wasnt fucking crazy and marie antoinette never said let them eat cake/brioche yesh but basically yea trm is a connective thing but i think they did intend to split it into at least two books but shafted that idea same with NB the balls were in both but it was in the background like trm is just trr book 1 the problem is tc&tf is like uhhhh a tv show in universe like arthurian legend its basically the cordonia version of merlin and excalibur and shit nah they had a throwaway convo about how much of it was real in TRR like how much of the real kenna was in this like its the same as 'Arthur' was technically a real person and Robin Hood and Prince John were real people its just kinda the nature of national identity myth making like christian theology has all this St. George slayed a dragon St. Patrick magically shooing all the snakes out of ireland the basic answer is its the biggest crop and export like the american midwest's obsession with corn exactly ...eh depends where definitely knew a few corn cob queens in Iowa white people  dfhdsas basically as I understand it Hero, Endless Summer and The Crown and the Flame are TV Shows in universe same with America's Most Eligible TC&TF is their version of Game of Thrones (which is a shot at how Game of Thrones is just a magicified War of the Roses) yea we learn all the others are TV shows from TFS didnt know VOS was tho neat i thought VOS was made real to unite the sterlings but basically like the war of the roses its a dramatized part of history TRM is the connective tissue before TRR actually yea game of thrones is the war of the roses is kinda a good way to explain it yep exactly they get some $$$ he is but they did it after the fact i think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjO55pKuBo4 using that as the base tc&tf makes more sense as the GOT spoof since theyre both making a magic'd up version of history with actual real people ^ I remember that too which was weird cause theyre in maine not in NY true but you need to live in the state to run for an office like that and for a while too otherwise its carpetbagging i think some other books tie in i know all the hartfield books tie in and the elementalists and bachelorette party tie in yea rip NB spinoff ye and the ghoul gang do too lily and the zombie girl start fangirling yea it also tied in during BP the magician guy went to the magic school hes like fire attuned honestly it feels like cordonia is just their way to make super england while also having a real england its weird Lol definitely On all counts It really is apple England The problem is they expanded the world And so it like Takes away from the magic when theres a world around it Even if amalas is bae ahhhh omg i got nominated for something and 100% shocked none of my reviews did or the OH rant like damn also final tally on the downvotes from last night -55 on acor sucks -18 that show dont tell is anti-communist propaganda from the farfield foundation like people piled on cant believe ACOR still has that strong a circlejerk  ofc yea im like legit like wait was my bitching about mtfl that more popular than the OH rant damn im allll caught up :3 witcher but like damn get it facebook also lmao someone who plays DA responded to my shit and it was like OMG I FEEL SEEN because she wrote the toxic flamebag LI in that too queen oh hey im on tales sweet
