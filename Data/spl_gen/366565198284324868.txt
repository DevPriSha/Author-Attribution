(dramatic song begins the play) just the thing with asian dramas i guess :shrugs: the thumbnail looks promising :KEKW: same moty is kind of like, LOA lite?? court proceedings being a major part of the plot idk i just want to keep with that energy and now we get to play on the law side yeah side note. as someone in STEM, the title bothers me because that's definitely a physics thing oh well, the pun works as needed, i suppose oh hella the T rewards me for my appreciation of ladies in suits once you got nitro its hard to go back :wMM_sad_juple: weird that ios gets them first since the apple app store is a lot tighter on the apps it has that is true which is also why theres the myth that vamps dont show up in pictures photographic film had silver in it but cameras now are digital, so vamps won't face the same problem canon is an actual term in catholicism wait wait me too :ach_stafie: also consider the audience of broadway shows those people can definitely fork over the money to get vaxxed amen yes from what i hear of it im just in specific internet niches and don't like to explore out of it it's this generations "mood" or "oh worm?" *the opposite of "cringe"* hm. thats an easy way to put it that's if you're dividing generations by culture rather than years they were born which makes more lines drawn i should count as gen z, age wise, but i'm also in the cusp years of pre-2005 where we share a lot of culture with the last millenials thats also a weird thing i noticed from people with younger siblings we just get to a point where we refuse to consider that they're also growing up like sure i'm a lawful adult but no way is my sister, who is four years younger than me, older than 12 dang hilariously, in filipino, mara-di-na would be mara not anymore ?? morty ? i think thats because the animation is coded in ? so the assets themselves are non-moving ^^ yup. so the animated backgrounds wouldn't be in the assets it's the same with the magic pop ups in TE im so glad they addressed that they wont use ***Zombies*** as a title its the zombie genre theyre never getting anywhere with the zombie genre without being cringey  Shipwrecked and you're the only two people on the island dont know how i feel about that actually i do but theyre not good vibes shipwrecked is gonna be VIP someone just sent it on my server but i did send a question to ask also.. they just haven't replied to me  ugly fonts are really good at increasing productivity i had a phase where i used century gothic almost religiously oh oh i just realized that phase is around the same time i got into punk music that's hilarious grade 8-9 mazie listened to punk and alt music, and used century gothic for everything fast forward to senior year where i submitted all my lab reports in comic sans simply because i had given up i think at one point the school printer ran out of black ink so i even submitted in a really nasty Default Blue comic sans honestly if the teacher never specified, it's a free for all i mean... perfect match very valid like.. on paper? because in my mind i'm thinking like, the ***thwap!*** and the ***whack!*** kindsnof effects or cough cough animations happy birthday!!! :kek: my vip finally expired (though the email saying so was two weeks ago. so i've been an unpaid vip for two weeks) anyway not a vip anymore choices is drunk tho isn't it a thing for the internet now that you have to disclose sponsorships :shrugs: maybe that's just a youtube thing welp turns out it's not a youtube thing, it's FTC legislation and yeah it's pretty fast and loose but it is still a legal requirement man, climates around the world are so bonkers to think about same ish we can go down to 18 in december it's literally 34 C here now :ch_cryin: just checked but it is humid as fuck so it feels more like 40 we can call 24C cold but if i talk to a canadian, that's warm for them that would be so cold but also. winter fashion is cute wish i could wear it more often yup somehow i developed a sense of style that likes wearing tights and sweaters and boots but where i'm from, those are not great things to wear a friend of mine from vietnam will be moving to bristol for university and we talked to her about how she'll survive any heatwaves they have no wonder it's apparently so rainy it's short of Zoanna actually remember that one time long ago when we had like 4 books in a week the most memorable releasing period for me was TH:M every week of those chapters coming up i used to keep my phone underneath the lab table just to play in class no rent you only get three turns in jail before you're forced to bail out but make those 3 turns count yes i have a google doc i have gripes with their writing but those are personal their business practices are in general just Bad nix hydra kept their kickstarter backers on hold for a long time and then said "hey we won't be able to fulfill these anymore. we'll give you a refund, but wait... we will also be super late at giving you your money back" no idea kickstarter comments are full of stuff like this no idea what became of it i left the fandom pretty soon and i just get anger thinking about the arcana so i try to do that less now ice cream too carefully if you guys want like, bookworm adventures or other reaaally old pc games https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S6KV_8iBoRxm2WIEXkh7fjRpS3iQuqbh/view?usp=sharing 498 but true i miss silly math problems on one hand i am an engineering major and i kinda like math but i just miss dumb math problems ugh DBH? i miss it so much YOU'RE RIGHT AND YOU SHOULD SAY IT why was north the only option cowards yeah their dynamic is great as it is. no need to draw super weird romantic connotations from it and why he gets so bothered that connor keeps coming back :(( that's bryan dechart's favorite line in the game ah that it was on beta and i knew a few people who had it it was a dnd server too so she was able to have a completely different pfp in our game server so she could use the picture of her character no idea the nitro page doesnt mention custom avatars per server yet might also be the more expensive nitro, which isnt what i got but i havent logged on my laptop yet so who knows i know that the setting should be around where you change your nickname too yup that's the one really convenient for roleplay and game servers change your nickname it should be there weird https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1440762825031495681?s=20 i love cinema wins SAME honestly i stopped watching cinemasins after i discovered cinemawins i guess the positivity got to me in the end lmao i do still enjoy watching some cinemasins videos but as someone who enjoys watching movies, i go for the guy who also has fun watching things i would tell you to not type when youre walking but that would be hypocritical of me its going back to 2020 starboard really is just going through all posts made last year until today a trip down memory lane that seemingly no one asked for yet here we are starboard strapped us on a rollercoaster and we have to just deal with the notifications that come with it throwback thursday it's sending all starred messages since 2020 > An ARSC file is an application resource table used by programs developed for the Android operating system. It is a binary file that contains a table-format list of the resources included in an Android program, including the resources' names, properties, and IDs. no idea what that means greatest common factor here too but also yeah how the fuck w trigo at best GCF/LCM are arithmetic and algebra problems well, it did have sequel bait at the end my comfort movie has always been Enchanted electricity it takes power to operate servers and whatnot you wouldn't really consider it but YouTube, Discord, Twitter, etc. also use up a lot of power the difference between those and NFTs is that those sites at least do a public service scams :shrugs: wow i wish i knew dutch what the heck does that even mean ZIJ ZIJN ZIJN ZOONS babe new pronouns just dropped uw u.... uw zoon famous last words ajskdk you're using that one extension? that blocks all people who liked a tweet/followed an account or... it was planned but like, with malice in mind because from what i know about texas, nothing seems accidental or incompetent. just, you know, evil because if you even think of stopping your car, your tires will melt have yall ever heard of hostile infrastructure but a whole goddamn city that was meant as a joke but basically hostile architecture is when something is designed to be inconvenient for people like how benches have unnecessary armrests so the homeless can't sleep there you guys could have had a good railroad system but nooooooo top gear had that one episode where they raced a car against the japanese high speed public transport and im pretty sure the public transport won if they did it again, the trains would definitely win since japan just opened a new line when public transport workers strike in japan, they still continue to work but they don't accept fares anymore and they know that so they don't disrupt everyone's lives but still effectively strike by denying their employers profit the comments on wikia are also a trip omg dude you're hurting yourself staying here OOF ykno i think the wikia fandom is the way it is because they know PB is never gonna see them i like tumblr in general but the choices fandom on tumblr? no facebook is where people also talk about their personal lives so that makes it a scary place to have fandom like, your Friends and Family can see you it takes a special kind of person to want to engage in fandom where their friends and family can find them thats just the opposite end of the spectrum these are people who do not *care* anymore or american have yall seen the thing about smoking and masculinity NO AJSKKDJDKDKD OH MY GOD ma'am that is a 16 year old boy how can you complain about surrender and then also ask for a felony i wish i had more to say about the infantilization of asian men (esp in kpop spaces) but really my essay starts and ends with "it's bad, please stop" if you do talk about western artists like kpop stans do, it gets super uncomfortable and apparent that korean artists are their uwu little meow meows AKDKDKDK you should yes pls the choices fandom is just a mess overall different platforms, different flavors great joy can be found in renaming all the RoE characters something stupid Twitter: thinks PB cares what they say YASSIFY CHRIS POWELL also.... lester ??? enough JOEY GRACEFFA???!!! what the heck is Talent Acquisition oh is that just hiring people they need to hire someone to hire more people got it ngl the name's so pretentious :kek: especially for instructional videos when you go on youtube specifically seeking a help video for something you want to do, etc, the likes/dislikes is your first meter that the video can be helpful or not entertainment isn't the only thing you're hosting, youtube  sometimes people want to watch a video on how to wire a circuit and don't want to watch a scam im on the "yes its too late" side here how festive evil gingerbread slightly yellow can be eggnog?

hey is anyone here a member of mlf's discord server, pls be transparent the secret pixelberry agent can stay quiet but mlf server member fess up sorry i will send the proper sticker i am going through hell actually (but yes, finals week, in simpler words) but also because of online learning.... it's *not* finals *week* all the deadlines are spaced out so its kind of like three finals weeks on top of each other fun not spaced out enough to give me decent breaks, but spaced out perfectly to maximize the torture period one of my math finals (because god help me i have more than one math class) has a deadline of 3 days, and on god they're so much items they are making SURE those 3 days get used i got math 23, 27, and 40. life of a stem student constantly ends :raifepain: if bots can be trained to decipher l337speak then dn h doesn't accomplish anything probably just makes it harder for screenreaders take care of yourself ^^ and happy holidays could also be referring to some roman out there certainly a name used at some point in ancient history this feels like it deserves a seizure warning :kek: https://youtu.be/KslJjXeR1pI NO ONE INFORMED ME i never really had a boy band phase growing up but im sure as hell about to develop one james and logan doing backflips at every performance of Windows Down

me, weak:  i am obsessed with their harmonies, goddamn pokemon do be battery hungry i'm sure at some point the android emulators will update to work with new macs last good social media tbf their hand was just forced because of Apple's policies, yadda yadda and tumblr staff is wonderfully incompetent as per usual, it's not good at employing its new Purge 2021 Edition so there's a lot of new albeit inconvenient ways to get around it yeah iOS wants the apps on it to be ~friendly~ ykno, so tumblr gets to be the one to accomodate that in the most inconvenient way possible tumblr made fun of tiktok censorship and now look where that got us :KEKWhands: listen, if we didnt leave from the ban 3 years ago, we aren't leaving again but also i think a poorly documented part of the ban years ago is that tumblr actually started deleting accounts at random in 2018 it was like the thanos snap on that site (because that was the year infinity war was relevant) and accounts were getting offed left and right for no reason im only learning what tags are on the banned list now and god, tumblr really is?? i have no idea how they decided all these the #reblog tag is on the banned list #Leah rambles is on the banned list, which is usually how people tag random text posts. mine is like, "#not good enough to be on twitter.txt"  or something. anyway this means someone named Leah rambled so much on their own personal tag that tumblr *had* to make them stop https://bannedtags.tumblr.com/post/671680429953368064/does-putting-a-period-at-the-end-of-a-tag-work-as seems tumblr implemented some code that basically said "if this tag has a certain amount of flagged posts, then destroy it" without keeping things like percentages in mind. so common tags like #submission and #my art are being banned :kek: ^^ i haven't used the twitter app in over a year. i just have the website saved as a shortcut on my phone (obligatory Fuck JKR goes here)

mood tho, deathly hallows really went there mayhaps i am too entrenched in Marauders Era fic but i hate the guy :kek: i think he's a compelling character but if he were a person... all bets are off he's getting decked but he isn't a real person so we're good we shouldn't really be holding fictional characters to the same standards as real people anyway  do love the one interview JKR did where a fan asked if Snape would care if Harry wasn't Lily's son and the answer was a resounding "No, he'd probably be in Azkaban" and that never fails to make me laugh hm, i must have seen a misquote but same energy textbook slytherin you know what, this 100% tracks for you he's a fucking Gaius isn't he ........i can see it now, it absolutely applies - did some stuff that he really shouldn't be forgiven for (supporting a bigot/all that shit with Kamilah, etc)
- very powerful What If energy (what if he *wasn't* a death eater/all that shit with Rheya)
- hair (though Gaius's hair is objectively better than Snape's) it really works :kek: would be a very different person if he'd had someone to love him, just saying (this applies to both Snape and Gaius) if he just stopped getting hung up on miss moral superiority lily potter and actually found himself a decent support system yes same thoughts like i said, he's not a real person. i think it's real dumb to get into it as if he isn't written first and foremost to be a plot device i see a lot of passionate snate and,,, he's not on trial to go to prison, *relax* people sjskdkkdkd good luck with that 2 paragraphs on his parallels with Gaius Augustine i toe the line between ENTP and ENFP and lucky for me they're the same in the meme lmao but yeah it's a bit like astrology not the best personality model fair enough nasty of him to take away lupin's right to teach the kids about werewolves himself, but protecting the kids during the werewolf attack itself really a nuanced character tracks for him when it comes down to it he does a good thing but man he does all these little things :kek: i just feel lupin deserved to teach the kids that werewolves were not monsters from the get-go ^^ pretty much little nasty things, big net good im gonna go reread the fic where snape maintains a friendship with lily and becomes harry's godfather i am #emotional thats so wild because HP is rarepair central anyway https://archiveofourown.org/works/11457669 we could have had it aaaalllll this fic makes me cry a lot do i think he deserved to have harry name a son after him? no but in general i think letting harry name all his children was kinda stupid in the first place :kek: James and Lily Potter 2.0s were there to confuse people who skipped to the ending just to see what happened i know at least two people who read ahead that James and Lily were walking down Platfrom 9 3/4 and being super confused about it why did ginny agree to any of that girl, what's up that poor kid, born in the early 2000s, and his name is Albus Severus i know wizards are weird about their names but this boy was born in 2006 that's just sad for him my stance on redemption is less "this character did too much bad to be forgiven" and more "their redemption should work with the themes of the story" which is why Gaius not being killed at the end of BB3 is so heartwarming sorry to overturn the snape moment to gaius but honestly his entire plot in bb3 makes me so emotional like i think a poppy redemption would be stupid in the story ... it makes QB uninteresting that way. but is she incapable of redemption? absolutely not. she can be redeemed there's a difference with downright unforgivable and narratively improper ooh yup movie 3 is my favorite 3 is the middle point of the whimsical magic of 1 and 2, and all the dark stuff about to come out of the rest of the series oh you're gonna love 5 and 6 i do wish jkr planned the books ahead way more because i think you're gonna love the crumbs of Regulus :kek: who only becomes a character way later reg deserved to be an order spy right next to snape, deserved a lot better  alan rickman does such a good job LMAO hmmm i still havent watched the reunion documentary ahdkdk however i have been informed that they accidentally use a picture of young Emma *Roberts* instead of young Emma Watson it's just such a funny oversight to me considering the production team essentially watched her grow up side note mad respect to said production team for the hp movies because.. for a saga loaded with child actors, they all came out of it pretty well adjusted ? to be fair there is nothing more slytherin than choosing to be in slytherin. house of ambition, it's a pretty conscious choice to be there anyway i'm a ravenclaw pretty sure i'm the in-between of ravenclaw and slytherin but the fact that i would rather flip a coin than make the choice rules me out for slytherin i only trust unnecessarily long uquizzes now chase after what u want  all my favorite characters are the ones born in the 60s  i stan exclusively dead people in this coming of age series centering on children growing up ages 11 to 17,,, i decided my favorites were all the adults on the side a lot of my reading is a lot of teen YA and yet i still get absolutely floored when the books say the characters are 16/17 especially the more action-forward books it's so weird to me now because these characters all definitely used to be older than me when i read them the first time now characters have to be at least 23 before i get comfortable enough to engage lmao no wonder college aus are popular oh hell yeah, lockhart lots of people hate him but as a ravenclaw i mad respect him i also think it's super funny that the handwave for the harry potter mobile game is that lockhart obliviated all the main characters and that's why the plot of the game never gets brought up in HP also he's clearly a good writer like Sure he steals his plots but that's half the effort of writing he's good with words if he got that popular you can't just listen to someone tell a story and manage to write it down in a way people like his mistake was selling them as true stories could have gotten just as popular if he made them up to be fictional true hell, he could have been a biographer lockhart is good at what he does, no lying about that valid ive plagiarised like hell, i totally get him i think maybe a lot of it is also his background as a Ravenclaw. he's a talented writer but is bad at thinking up ideas for himself love that for him OH GOD he has impostor syndrome so he started out with impostor syndrome and then,,,, dug himself deeper into a hole when he started messing with people's memories i want to give him a hug ....dilf also 100% the man loves his family morally bent but that doesn't have to be an issue the whole plot of half blood prince is that voldy wanted lucius punished for events in order of the phoenix which is why draco was chosen to do it it was a punishment for the malfoys draco's parents love him so much lucius was also quickest to renounce because his loyalty is always first to his family america has a decent railroad system? sure lol if i had a nickel for every zombie-focused media i know that kills a dog, i would have two nickels jfc why did this happen twice THEY'RE BOTH NAMED SAM TOO???? i guess i have to amend the statement two nickels for every dog in zombie-focused media that happen to die and also be named Sam the great american baking show :// great british bake-off just rolls off the tongue so well MASH is a medical show ??? wait omg lol i was thinking of Smash SMASH is a musical show and that's what i was thinking of lmao i mean, it used to only have ten months thats why september october november december are very obviously number rooted ten month calendar, where september to december are 7 to 10 and then julius and augustus said they want their own months in the middle of the year so they snuck july and august right into the summer season. 12 month calendar was born its based on harvest afaik not exactly summer/winter split maybe the world will end 2012 as intended no one's around to take care of my old high school's campus cats anymore  i hope they went off to hunt for themselves good. hydrate i feel like voltratorship and maratocracy are better word choices priarchy is good and can stay ah marathoritarian hm not as good maratatorship it is :MARAONLY: not to be confused with simp elation, the joy derived from being a goddamn simp seemingly no ~~he didnt live past 1997, mara~~ i didnt realize he had a january birthday the more you know fair enough smaller, closer to the depths of fiery hell yes but the trick is you have to buy the vip on a normal copy of choices, logged in to facebook ofc then uninstall, install the modded apk, log in boom, unlimited keys and unlimited diamonds i should know, from experience since we've been forcibly moved okay god, you snape simp clapping along to happy is free serotonin congrats tho it was a popular twitch emote same with pog got big on twitch alan rickman in that thumbnail is so.... Gaius the look is very Gaius \*gasp* was this your plan all along and was i your unwitting accomplice  jk i've known your plan all along but seriously massive gaius vibes from that snape look if i had it on hand, i'd send the "it's the same picture" meme where does mara fit into this cool and malfoy somewhere off to the side i guess ?? lighting and scent, ambience of the evening use it terrifying look, actually if u do end up dating a billionaire you better work to convince them on a four day work week ANYHOO https://twitter.com/MadMarx37/status/1482620950441078785?s=20 no idea, just yassified cannibalism ITS A REAL WEBSITE i thought it was fake oh no as a project, it's probably fake but the fact that someone Spent to have that domain name and website being hosted celebrity stans are getting crazier and crazier these days stalker fans, so true yeah but it's kanye as eminem intended semantic change one of my favorite and least favorite things about language old english is loaded with a bunch of these meat used to mean litealy any food item
wife meant any woman, married or not woah thats cold i mean, they are but hilarious that it's the same outlet the common cold is a coronavirus pie only for the lulz really #guilty-ass-charged for LoA tangent but i love the colors you both make your name colors look so pretty next to each other :( lmao dark red looks like server parent is here and server baby you also get white man's whore, drew isnt there a limit to roles its probably like 100 tho so we're good there is also a secret baby probably but we need to figure out if it's snape or gaius's well then it wouldnt be a secret jk wait im Just looking at the emoji now yeah that.. sure is megamind adrian :megadrian: :heheadrian: it encompasses such a broad range of emotions how are you feeling? :heheadrian: :heheadrian: :heheadrian:  aw too bad he only knows one emotion :heheadrian: he knows not of pain only hehe no theyre just combine into megahehe "Is that a fucking transformer" you really are a server baby ive never felt more old theyre better casted as children of their parents like if you look at the actors they got for the parents, the kids are super well cast no its so fun tho there's a reason why cheryl is the best character these days and it's because she's the only one committing to the bullshit it could be a full blown hot mess, absolute bachelorette party not the star just that she gets the best moments because the actress knows exactly how crazy it is and she leans into it https://youtu.be/DZ-FRSXypUE this basically covers my thoughts but it's unhinged and delightful the show is essentially just that one archie comics that has zombies it became popular because of how wild the premise is ,img afterlife with archie yeah they technically are but same haha weirdly enough when i make stories with OCs, i still see them as fanfic-adjacent there's a difference between OCs made to exist in the world and OCs made for your fanfic yep i did a lot of fandom roleplay back in the day so oc is just a whole thing in my head the star wars forum i used to rp in got offed so i can only find it on the wayback machine but man, i roleplayed with an edgelord once i want to pick their brain so badly pretty much :KEK: i figured it out it's the people who create their ocs expecting they're going to be the main character the best rp forums are the ones that fully aware they're gonna end up being an ensemble-cast sitcom our most popular forum was just an ask and answer in character wtf muscular arms erasure skipping paid scenes probably you heard of the person who refuses to take their shoes off in a no-shoes house, get ready for the person who apparently has never eaten at a restaurant owned by someone from a prominent food culture it's an alt account too and she took the post down off the subreddit you see a lot of hypotheticals there, people just writing things they wish they did/saw other people do and have people take the right side nice ^^^ this tbh they paywalled him they're writing with the thought of premium choices in mind which Sucks they're locking something necessary to the narrative behind a paywall that most players will choose not to shell for backing people into a corner to buy a choice is, a bad idea Nix Hydra has some shitty business practices re: micro-transactions but at least the premium choices were always non-essential to the plots then again paid choices in the arcana led to art scenes pixelberry doesn't exactly have a carrot on a stick it's gone full pay-to-play/win goodbye paid choices within paid scenes, you were never appreciated and in the end is a punny achievement card you'll get on the top of your screen for five seconds it just failed to meet its premise it was Not a political thriller the school setting is kinda what killed it the royal masquerade delivered a better political thriller where's the flashy galas and events, the speeches and conventions you put us in a fucking School if they wanted, could have made it more like Red White Royal Blue thats literally what it looks like anyway > After an incident at a royal wedding, Alex has to pretend to be friends with England's Prince Henry, to prevent it becoming a full-blown diplomatic and media crisis that would distract from his mother's election bid. While the effort is initially to control the damage, the two actually do become friends. They eventually become romantically involved.... the thing really is that FA isn't *bad*. it has the bones of a good book and that's it it's all just bones checks out for california how did it go march again :PleasePBJustStop: like in general just processing that it's march of 2022 i have never been so discouraged to follow someone back until now i actually checked, they're a real account and post a lot of bnha but Wow they're really good at making their account look like they're a bot ohhhh it's a darwin thing wordle? technically yes that was the appeal of it. everyone gets the same word and there's literally nothing else going for it. the simplicity of it was nice since the new york times acquired Wordle, they edited the word list it's still the same for everyone but some people don't use NYT's Wordle such as myself we archived the original website before New York Times shut it down, so we're still working with the original word list that NYT hasn't edited by the way the website creates the thing for you by sharing your results because i know a lot of people who actually did this manually Wordle 269 5/6*





 yeah i figured you were one of those people  wait wait wait did yall Start DST or end it this month because i am literally never sure yeah it makes scheduling for my game nights a bit weird at times but just, i am never sure when it starts or when it ends. just an endless cycle of "oh people are complaining about daylight savings again!" the bill passed unanimously yeah its fine but also it costs nothing (yet) so if you wanted to get into it you can before NYT slaps a paywall on it and ruins it for everybody :ch_shrugs: NYT paywalls everything because the transition from print to digital media has not been kind pink became a fem thing because thats how they marked homosexuals and purple was only a royal color because of how hard it was to create as a dye something about a very specific snail slime, if i remember correctly yup... star of david for jewish people, pink triangle for gay men there was reclamation of the triangle during the aids crisis eyup though the holocaust identification version was an upside down triangle.. but yeah, the feminization of pink > In ancient Rome, purple was the color of royalty, a designator of status. And while purple is flashy and pretty, it was more important at the time that purple was expensive. Purple was expensive, because purple dye came from snails. yup snails, which were expensive. so purple became a royal color just because only rich people could get it trying to look into the historical blue is for girls but the most i'm finding is that pre-wars, people's approach to dressing children was just picking colors that already matched their physical traits so babies with blue-eyes got dressed up in blue i did a 2 word guess once it was immediately followed by me breaking my streak the next day we have an earthquake drill like once a year out of necessity and yeah, written exams is wild lol pacific ring of fire things, lol weird if you're touching the pacific ocean, you get an earthquake in your area at least twice a year  doesn't matter how small it is "was there an earthquake just now" on everyone's google search history lying in bed during a tiny earthquake is a weird experience made worse probably by the fact that my bed has wheels nah grade 10 should probably mention i went to philippine science it's mathematical proof that's the topic i mean i had the worst teacher for this specific topic geometry and mathematical proof shittiest teacher i ever had refused to record one of my exams because i didnt write my full name yeah i did but only because he was only around for a quarter khan academy, baby! i'd help you with the filipino but i'm also very distinctly northern and it's just going to confuse us both filipinos from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao trying to talk to each other is like if you French, Quebecois and New Orleans people tried to talk to each other they might all be speaking french but it's their own versions of french there's only one language Filipino all the others are dialects > Dialect is a variety of language distinguished by grammar, pronunciation, or vocabulary, spoken in a specific area by a specific group of people. i remembering reading one poem back in... grade 9 im trying to look for it it's about the overlap of words in filipino dialects well idk what i expected trying to find it on google "Langgam sa Bisaya, tingin sa taas!"
>langgam means 'ant' in Tagalog but 'bird' in Cebuano only line i found sjdkdkd oh deep words yeah being native isn't gonna help you anyway :ch_cryin: this is what we call nosebleed. only people who like, chose to study filipino in college or some shit can talk like this karunungan = knowledge afaik, so karunungan-bayan is like... old sayings and stuff. phrases people just know sort of thing it's a very context heavy language so it's hard to construct and translate sentences but by definition the words are always very literal if you're considering using a translator for help, it's a bad idea to translate whole sentences. they're never going to capture what it's supposed to mean

translate it through word by word and then just try to figure out the sentence based on what each word means. yeah that would be the karunungang bayan bugtong thats a riddle i know theyre not asking you the answer the riddle but it's "light" yeah grain of rice that covers the whole house light :rip: dumbledore ron ron ron weasley do none of you know the mysterious ticking noise you don't need to be one https://youtu.be/Tx1XIm6q4r4 nice. hope its a good one nah i have a friend studying Filipino Lit in UP so i just bother him and he gives me word help are you guys ever taught that microsoft word and other word processors can do APA formatting on its own oh thats valid ms word learn how to add pictures properly why are you creating a new page word is the worst microsoft office program cleaner and also carries over multiple devices i have so many webkinz plushes i actually logged back into webkinz in like..  2019? https://gyazo.com/061a90c1409ce332104f253fbc8406ca old screenshot found obviously no one is updating the quizzes on webkinz anymore so the "pop culture" quiz stops at about 2007 i felt both super old and also a child apparently moshi monsters also went under already? as in disconnected like club penguin was my first ever webkinz plush was a frog named Twinkle but uh, lowercase which bothers me to this day the old internet of our childhood poptropica is probably still running but they locked all the licensed content and i never got behind the episodic island thing hell yeah the way you can just make them wear dresses if you want phenomenal the way childrens websites now just redirect to online stores and flash is dead too maybe it's because you keep forcing the religion onto young people when in fact faith should be something personal it also creates this situation where more than half the existing christians in the world are so disconnected from what their religion should be teaching and are just going along with everything literally everything in the old testament should not be considered a law, like that's the whole point. the only rule is love each other but nah man, mindlessly following a game of schizophrenic telephone honestly yeah tying your morality to your religion is kinda fucked and don't trust anyone who does it you can be a good person non-secularly we joke but there really are people like that  i think a lot of medical insurances are weird about surgeries that aren't elective/emergencies tube tying but not hysterectomy? weird different era (but still the same shit today) my grandmother got her tubes tied by having her brother pretend to be her husband and sign all the papers lmao god sorry i just remembered some terf nonsense because of this i love the sound of that rolls of the tongue in a very fun way sounds like a time i didnt know it was ace day but i coincidentally posted by aroace playlist on spotify earlier lmao we still have poles here

one time when i was 14 the pole next to our house caught fire
we didn't lose power but our neighbors did good. i hated scrat but yes i would like to see that article sounds like a wild chain of events what the heck god. that watcher video where he eats like a british teenager and the consultant talks about how the food is all god's gift to england and no offense but it sounds like the blandest shit ever AKSKDKDK https://youtu.be/iXL-fUu4YRM because you dont have to think about plot much in a way that, giving WTD a series for more plot kind of devalues its first installment true on that overlapping staff thing more WTD means pushing back stuff like BOLAS2 even further back gummies :) clearly im a fruit bitch. i like lemonade you are no longer MO on the meaning of FOMO happy easramover :ch_cryin: yeah that sounds about right "can't be arsed" was the gateway to full-blown british rage amazing how was it (no spoilers pls) also im going to the beach with my cousins! i really enjoyed the first sonic so i cant wait to watch the second wow i wonder whose birthday it is danke woo!!!! ....sir im so glad zutara shippers let go of calling themselves zutarians like... it's Weird completely missing the relationship of an otter and a jack russel terrier :ch_shrugs: full disclosure i ship zutara but on god, ATLA was my first fandom on tumblr and the ship wars were a nightmare i am happy to just stay in my lane :smokebreak: normal written fic is better LMAO yeah bad writing aside it was literally all just traced my guy, you didn't need to make it a comic what even is thick cold coffee somehow all im thinking of is ice cream incorrect. this is actually the cheesemaking process, not milkshakes i use my dog like a weighted blanket and my inability to breathe knocks me right out of consciousness /j love that for u your word count is delicious i envy it oc fics don't get a lot of traction on their own tbh either way so many words UGH  same six years ago maybe I would have let chapters out into the wild with 1k or less but now it needs to be at least 3k 500 words? that's just an establishing scene well I have had the tab open i'll get to it when the semester ends  urban dictionary, huh Other Adult Materials well, okay I suppose not entirely incorrect birthfae!!! the diamonds for every 3 chapters is helpful enough and 15 for every book finished (i may or may not have exploited that last chapter glitch on AVSP before they got rid of it) a book entirely about a social climber and college elitists? no no we gotta make it sexy my appreciation for BOLAS goes as far as... romance not mattering like it still makes sense regardless of who im romancing if anyone at all FA goes off the rails if youre not paying for anyone's scenes.. especially the skinny dipping one OH is annoying if youre not romancing ethan QB's character choices arent supported if youre not romancing Kingsley like ffs if nothing is going on between MC and Kingsley then why is she so worried they'd lose their job yeah she didnt get a dirty 30 smh pb should have done us a favor and just, not give us the illusion of choice some one-LI books show that PB actually *can* make them pretty good TNA and Witness are just too horny to function PB's stopped being ambitious ES and TC&TF were written to be series from the getgo intended to have sequels MW just had the unfortunate fate all other early books met their ends in a way they wanted to idk i just miss when PB would write because they have a story to tell theyve created a formula and now they wont let go of it take those risks again, PB i miss the MW/TC&TF system how you could pay your way through with diamonds,, or with points you got by making the right choices idk but that would actually compel me to spend more? i would be throwing keys left and right (if i still had any because of vip) trying to get those prestige points roe grandma is def chaotic good there's mitzi from AVSP lawful aligned no that happens to me every now and then when i delete the app and reinstall and i dont login immediately yeah it changes it used to be the og trio MW, TF and TC&TF. and then at some point they switched it out for ROE and then HSS also became one of the three years of repeatedly uninstalling and reinstalling this app romance i think leads to TRR now and vampire is obvious oh fuck you guys have tupperbox the bot which is what triggered jem :/ yeah i need to change his trigger if im going to use ^ more often My ThereWasAnAttempt but at least My Diamond Hoard Grows he treats margaret as a mother figure but the blake kids arent quite as family to him pretends to be a member, that's right skdkdkfk i think its hella ironic that MC was so pro-hookup culture, the plot should intend for MC and Cassian actually falling in love. and then the book was just them being exceedingly horny and that's even,,, an actual thing brought up against MC. that she's way to buried in hookup culture to actually build a relationship even if it wasnt pure sex, witness just isnt a good book (sigh) i think so wait lol nothing comes to mind yup ykno what, after being burned re: sensitivity consultation in other media i like... i'm glad that PB is doing a lot more than just slapping a "we hired a sensitivity consultant" as a blanket answer for all their steps flirt tc&tf love how their reasoning for not allowing reposts is for their personal sake and not because Pixelberry literally :ch_cryin: good (?) for them can't wait to find out what's next for vips! sometimes i eat them frozen i know they outsource the advertising and just send the assets but was recoloring the textbox really necessary LMAO isnt that the timer textbox he looks like he doesnt want to be there "research findings: pill worked too well. her body chemistry is strange." i have devised the perfect twist secret PB employee hiding in the server, i am open for hire it's revealed that MC had been working as a chemist in Dalton labs for a long time now but in the process of developing Desire Pills(tm) she tested them on herself and lost her mind, consumed by desire mc was once their most promising chemist... if only she hadn't made herself the test subject inb4 its about The Heir i think it would be great if the plot is that we get to play the heir's lookalike  you know what mc had like no home life anyway is "you good?" another alternative makes sense honestly i can't speak much to this because i have been reading fanfics of uk-based media, so my immersion to the culture is fucked up at best here people just forget to end calls so you hear a lot of yelling from the other side until one of you decides to end the call mood tho like, you're already on the phone, give yourself some character! i have never come face to face with a swan terrifies me tho what about geese cutie babeys wait was it otters in the finding dory movie that created traffic this is only somewhat related, im just having memory flashes :kek: plus the ILITW music in book 1 you know what now i know why theyre in the same universe ILITW, NB and BB (and VOS) are all in the same universe because they just steal each other's soundtracks in a circle BB is doing the stealing first vampire theme goes hard tho sexy ass bass drop idk why but BB is such a comfort series for me the BB writers committed hard to the vampires. insane worldbuilding what a strange bit of information this reminds me PB wants to make a black led book i am
 worried for the hell that will come out of that yeah its either the writing is so vague that it feels like.. nothing, or it's written to very clearly be one thing and the GOC part is an afterthought VIP is kind of their hail mary? especially now where theyve decided the new model is that basically all books will release under VIP man they should really have feedback forums do you think maybe they dont have beta readers (or whatever is the non fanfic equivalent of that) because ATV 100% reads better the more aware you are of the world

which is a problem they need QA testers too lmao the codes that slip through the cracks for GOC LIs instead of putting a book on hiatus and backtracking in the middle of release they only put a warning on kingsley being an LI *after the fact* QB's first chapter was out for hours by the time it became apparent that people wanted a content warning the only time i think they did warnings right was in MTFL tru there's a warning in WB too yeah JAKSKDK but i mean the police violence warning in MTFL, and making the scene skippable ugh nvm i loved that so much the phrasing of it is just, Fascinating. yea shane he has a decent neck length how's your life with this revelation :kek: the flagship series? never played? amazing and yet i still prefer damien nazario they did what yeah i havent the motivation to open the app  could just be the lyrics to the song but that's not how it vibes to me like i Want to be a reference to the song but i don't feel like it is lowkey transphobic oh i get that the poem's not malicious at all, just... kinda ignorant fixable left on the 3rd row or right actually the whole 3rd row 1 looks like a face you make on the toilet also god i hate how pb does hands it's so uncanny valley true ah yes The Cursed Heart slightly more ominous open heart but cursed, clearly it is up to you to define what Cursed means sorry ethan but i only like that role when monika does it were the eyes always that color they feel so unreal i love the fucking "Weird. You're fired." TC&TF i think im doing great didnt pb already get a lil mad before for leaks there's probably a theme that does or you can make one oh oh yup yeah late warning but thank you craziest one was the person who posted a picture of someone who Very Clearly embodies the first, with a very tiny sliver of white highlight, and then mistaking it for the second :pensivewobble: eyup i just woke up so im also late to the conversation but 100% was he a bad friend? pretty much. and so was she. they held on to a friendship that literally no one else is their lives wanted them to important to remember i think that all adults in HP either die or are just horrible people because otherwise there would be no plot also remember how he bargains with voldy for only lily's life. not the husband. not the kid eh, they can't get involved because they don't fit into the magical world just.. adults were for many reasons not allowed to help any of the children god i've been looking for this graphic i saw on tumblr that goes "it's not abusive if...." and a list of things but then like, it's an image so i can't just search it :pensivewobble: though i do remember seeing a post that goes "relationships are not all made for the sake of relationships. remember that these are stories. 'oh but this ship is toxic/unhealthy!' okay, so what are the themes of the media? was this relationship written in to support those themes?" well tried looking for it myself and got nada.

it looks like a graphic that came out of instagram.  literally as i've described, it's just a bulleted list that starts with "it's not abusive if..." its broadly internet culture now popular among gen z-ers but you're just as likely to see a 30 year old millenial spouting the same thing you hear people say it's gen z to incite some sort of generation war as someone who personally feels like i belong to either side, it's :shrugs: cusp is up to 2005 for people who still culturally can keep us with "90s kids" these are people who know what life without the iphone is like just saying thanks to the boom in technology and the internet the lines between millenial and gen z get very blurry and at best the overlap ends around 2005 another contributing factor is like, what generation your own parents were never got a phone until i was 13   :pensivewobble: pretty much and the only reason i got to use a laptop was because i joined the school paper. the only reason i actually got a phone was because i was displaying consistent behavior of. uh... leaving after school and not telling anyone where i am i once got the police called on me because i went out for pizza there were like two kids in my class who had blackberries who gives 10 year olds blackberries iphones are built to last until they release a new one didnt they literally get into a lawsuit because of planned obsolescence they actively make it harder for old models to keep working so that you need to buy the new one my family's so cheap i almost always got phones as soon as they were being phased out of market when Samsung released the Note 4, my parents got me the Note 1 because it was selling for cheap now that phone stores wanted to get rid of their stock this trend would continue for years until 2020, when i broke my phone and they finally got me something that isn't at least 4 years old on the market and/or secondhand sometimes facts can come off as passive aggressive it's 60% of the reason why i got into misunderstandings a lot at school sometimes people are offended by the sincerity of someone who is right what the hell we had a lil hiccup with vip book releases being weird but we're finding our rhythm again im the person who found all the closure scenes in d&d so i know where i stand here yes karen from mean girls energy huh discourse tumblr is insane the people who just follow everybody even if they disagree and then actively go on anti tags to make themselves angry. worst tumblr users ever ok well that section of tumblr went to twitter also tiktok yeah like, do something you enjoy (besides hating apparently). curating your space is nigh impossible but between all other social media, at least on tumblr it's Marginally Possible tiktok has some of the wildest takes ive ever seen AND they put their real faces on it :smoke: easier to avoid tho. god bless
