if anyone isn't bothered to read the news letter upcoming books: a lawyer/law firm book a zombie apocalypse book the mystery book that's been teased in the past and the next vip book I think will be around cooking/being a chef no clue at all I just realised that mhm I don't think they've picked any city but new York oh wait New Orleans San Francisco Oh yeah I don't think they've branched out on any kingdoms except cordonia(excluding crown and the flame, the royal masquerade etc) I'm glad choices are doing new genres I'm tired of the romances atp I'd like it based in other countries as well English speaking ones I think would be easier since making a story is a lot of work mhm that's what I was thinking
