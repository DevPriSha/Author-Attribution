HELLO thank you for inviting and accepting me!!! wow it’s just like the old server 😳 May I have She/Her and 18+ please? thank you :Dopeyhappy: I think you should make a role for people like Adam who don’t want their names changed and put it above the birthday role so birthday ppl can’t change it 🙂 I feel Theodosia’s so much :Dopeysad: her ending was just perfect I choose male except when the only option is an older man then I choose female I hope in the next GoC book there is an older female LI. so far only for WLW which is great but relationships where the male is younger are highly stigmatized and it’s unfair imo Congratulations Bee and Voltra! Spelling Bee it’s just nervewracking spelling out loud on the spot in front of a bunch of people even tho u know it what if we pronounced telephone the way we do Persephone it works for me did you try different people? what kind of cake? ooooh lotta egg yolks eh oh XD I was thinking it needed like a dozen like the egg whites in angel food cake but yolks are way more dense they used that in teasers cuz they would have to draw all the diff hairstyles it’s not meant to be canon it’s just so they can make teasers the game is about making choices not following canon Raleigh would be canonically male then too they do that for almost all the books default is a better way to put it **ALL**? I thought it added up to like hundreds of real dollars what only 80? ohhhh I can’t mod cuz I have iPhone crappy laptop :kek: I don’t think so no lol but it was clearly modeled after Mackenzie WOW its completely normal :ohgodohduck: :Duffyevil: I miss Singapore :Dopeysad: Bidets are awesome Everyone should have one I’m in cuz they basically traced over one of his pics who :huh: he looked way better before and different enough, but they were probably trying to play it safe people were harassing David Gandy??? for what?????
