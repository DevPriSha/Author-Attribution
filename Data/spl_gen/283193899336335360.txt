I don't miss it because people kept spamming the chat over and over with Rafael's name just to make it say the dumb "friendzoned [insert clown emoji here]" meme It was funny like, once People used it to spam a lot in general Lmaooo yeah I blocked it too I'll probably buy VIP only when TUH is done so I can binge all the VIP books in one go Yeah, I liked that PM acknowledged it if you romanced more than one LI but there should've been an extra scene with them discussing it as a group Lmao I mean, it's a book about a company that somehow makes super lifelike robots and passes them off as human so that's not the most far-fetched thing about it Tfw we never got a Damien and Dames threesome Tfw we never got a Hayden and Harley threesome either Lmaooo yeah it's weird how tame TC&TF and the early TF books are in hindsight TF had diamond smut scenes like the usual All books have diamond sex scenes except the high school ones, for obvious reasons Lmao Yeah TNA is probably the farthest it's going to go Oh yeah didn't they actually use the...words...in it Instead of the vague "down there" F Sdmfgnkhmsg No I mean like ||cock|| and ||pussy|| Oh well in that case it's not gone that far yet lmao I was misremembering I just took a brief glance at a YouTube playthrough Lmao yeah Makes you paranoid that the twins are gonna go do something stupid because their nanny's too busy banging their parent to be a responsible caretaker People actually read that book for that??? Oof Godspeed Plot twist: Baby Bump 2 is just Rosemary's Baby in app form and the MC gives birth to Satan's spawn Dumb and Dumber Don't jinx it lmao Have sweet dreams of demon twins Mara I mean Good night I never started the first one lmao I'll only go to it if I need diamonds Valid You can talk about them if you want Some games just aren't moddable for whatever reason Episode can't be modded, for example That too Choose sweet and sour stir fry Send me a piece ILITW definitely wasn't the bread and butter It Lives is the only horror series Choices has It's an exception, not the norm True but I barely count it because it was so short lmao And it's a stand-alone Pfffttt I think its only impact on the other books is that the black MC face has been reused for secondary characters, which is kind of weird Unfortunately none of the other MC faces in it have been reused  Nice I just found out I share my birthday with Amy Winehouse and Andrew Lincoln Did they just accidentally roast themselves Also why is the MC's hair on the left purple hsbdfmghk I used that face so this ad pains me lmao My MC would never have purple hair or get that Karen haircut  God what is that maid outfit that keeps showing up lmao Has it even been in a book or do I just not remember Didn't the writers hold a Reddit AMA a while back where they said the reason the ads are so weird is because they actually do draw in players lmao Like HOW Why is Ethan always the cheater lmaooo NHIE? Oh wait never mind I scrolled up lmao Never forget that Silas Prescott was based on Lionel Luthor from Smallville Look at this fucker It's racist to compare a black man to a terrorist. Be mindful of your words, please. It doesn't matter if it "had nothing to do" with his skin color. The point is it's wrong and racist. Don't do that again Also while I'm at it, that "meme" of comparing the dad from MTFL to an actual convicted sex offender was gross. You all need to be tactful Someone here posted a "joke" face claim comparing the white version of the dad from MTFL to Jared Fogle on the subreddit and I said it wasn't funny lmao Never forget that Sebastian was Eddie Redmayne Proof or it's not real Sdmfnghkms Every two weeks that same face claim gets posted by someone who thinks they're being new on the subreddit That guy doesn't look like '90s Leonard DiCaprio though He looks vaguely like a stoned, bored-looking version of him Jack Nicholson is spot on though Is that site safe That's so fucking creepy But then what are the odds he cares about some mobile app character lmao We have no proof he even knew though? People were just speculating PB's only reason given for the redesigns was that they felt they needed an "artistic change" or whatever Same tbh I order takeaway a lot these days though lmao I keep hearing about how great Storyscape is but I can never get through a playthrough of its stories because of the mouths lmao The way they move is so weird and creepy Like I don't understand people who dunk on Episode for having "cringey animations" but then gush over Storyscape when it's. The exact same thing hmsdnfkg Same goes for the people who also gush over Originals even though it has the exact same set-up as Episode Moving full body characters with repetitive animations and all Would love a horror book on Halloween tbh The only horror books we have are the It Lives series I'd only count THoBM as horror in the sense that it has ghosts But yeah that's about right And it would be nice to have a horror book that isn't supernatural, unlike those ones No ghosts, just a serial killer BaBu2 is going to have the MC give birth to Satanic twins clearly :kek: Rosemary's Baby: Choices edition Someone should name them Dumb and Dumber I'd say Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb but I don't think the character limit allows that lmao In seriousness, on the horror book topic I'd love a book with an And Then There Were None or Clue set-up A bunch of characters are stuck together in one location and start dying one by one, MC has to figure out who the killer is before everyone dies I guess you could call it that lmao It could have multiple endings too, where the killer turns out to be a different character depending on your choices I'm the epitome of maturity so I'm gonna name them Blow and Job Or better yet I'll name them after the impossible MostWanted2 and Hero2 I know  Oof I grew up in a majority white town so I was just used to being one of like, three or four Asians lmao So I got a lot of microaggressions and the "where are you really from :3" question at least once a year I just got used to it lmfao It was annoying but I couldn't do anything about it One time a boy asked me if I was from the "bad Korea or the good Korea" and I was like ???? Lmao He didn't believe me when I said I was born in New York so me mentioning I was Korean led to that. I said my parents were from South Korea and he was like "oh so you're from the good Korea" Like okayyyy Fucked up but it was in fourth grade So hopefully he, uh, matured Yikes My brother always said the N-word around me lmao I miss Vine Neither Save it to replay a book of your choice What happened to the icon :hmm: There's merch for everything these days  ~~Not gonna lie I'd buy Choices merch if it weren't so...cheap looking lmao~~ Now you just have to pick a fruit to make it sound like a real phone model :kek: Like Apple and BlackBerry clearly Brilliant Shedding hair is the worst Good luck, prayer circle you get the job  @unforgivablespelling Personally I wasn't bothered by ditching the Glam Lips people because it was pretty silly to start with and the lady who repped them was annoying as fuck, I was glad to get rid of her lmao But everything else was dumb Like how you can't stop your MC from making a fool of herself on the talk show no matter what You don't even get the choice to react maturely to your sister being mad at you?? Like what And how your MC's best friend ALWAYS turns on you and talks shit about you even if you're super nice to her and let her get her way at every turn Yeah that was good, it was nice that you got to customize your wedding dress and it wasn't gem locked like everything else lmao One of the high points of season 2 Oh yeah didn't they paywall things that were free before? That was dumb The angel costume was free at first and so was flying on the plane in first class but they got paywalled later Yeah that's what I mean What really irritates me about uhhh whoever the other LI's name was in season 2 because I don't care to remember is that they were gender-determinant based on your LI's gender and the male version was ugly as hell No not them The one who tries to get you to cheat on Alex or Taylor in season 2 Yeah I remember that much lmao Point is that their whole reason for existing was to cause drama with you and your LI and it didn't matter if you tried to turn him down, which annoyed the hell out of me I also disliked how the manager (I think her name was Kate?) become uber-controlling and pushy in season 2 for no reason when she was mostly reasonable in season 1 Feels like there was a change in writers or something Also do you remember friggin' "Sexy kitten" Or whatever her name was Because that was STUPID LMAO You see her once and think Alex or Taylor is cheating on you with her and then she never shows up or gets mentioned again?? I read that apparently it was going to be revealed she was just a bandmate who had to use the shower in Alex/Taylor's room and nothing happened with them but it got cut for pacing or something and it's like. Why was that not. In the story??? Oh yeah don't you start a record label in season 3 I don't know because I never finished it lmao RYLAND I knew it started with an R Look at this ugly fuck Why would you kiss him Like if you're going to have a love rival then at least make him hot Sdmffngkhmsdf Listen at least Drake doesn't have those CHEEKBONES This is weird I could've sworn Ryland was gender-determinant but I can't find any pics of the female version Was Ryland ever female in anyone's versions?? I'm pretty sure every LI was gender determinant Yeah I remember that much https://www.chaptercheats.com/qna/iphone-ipod/344665/Demi-Lovato-Path-To-Fame-Answers.htm?qid=137929 F for this poor player Male Alex looks like discount Justin Bieber Literally the same Okay good I'm glad I wasn't hallucinating female Ryland lmao Hsmdnfkgmhm Same I replayed season 1 like three times for the gems lmao The first time I played it I named my best friend Maria, which was awkward when the rival was also named Maria Lmao nice Every time I hear I Really Don't Care I remember the instrumental playing on every single scene break Did you play the other two seasons I played season 2 and dropped season 3 like two episodes in lmao I think so? Season 2 was the one where you had to go on another tour Why did all the female versions of the LIs look better than the male ones lmao They look like conventionally attractive women, meanwhile male Alex is Justin Bieber, male Taylor is a stoner hipster dude, and Sam is a tan white guy with an afro Though the Ink art style might have something to do with it lmao It was very...cartoony Yeah Episode's original stories have been downhill ever since Demi Lovato lmao Uhhhhh Season 2 has you marry your LI You customize your wedding dress, choose your maid of honor and bridesmaid dresses, stuff like that It was one of the few high points lmao God I know I completely blacked out all memory of PTF until now I married Taylor Yes They're the one who dumps you when you go on tour because something something commitment Then they come back and then they leave again I saw one player who was disappointed you can't romance them lmao There's always that one person Hjsmdfngk god I don't even remember what happened with Ryland other than the dumb "cheating" thing People only wanted him to be redeemed because he was French send tweet Which was dumb because the story never even let you reject him until he showed his true colors Episode's original stories always had a problem with railroading JMSNDFKGMHMH That would've been weird as hell Actually wait no considering that Episode bought stories about celebrities and made them your MC's LI that wouldn't have been too far-fetched lmao Remember Hollywood Days wth Hayes :kek: Good I played one episode and dropped it because it was so weird lmao Basically it was about you romancing the fictional avatar of some Vine celebrity called Hayes Griar or whatever And another time Episode made a story called It Started with a Lie about friggin'. Cameron Dallas I think his name was?? And that Dolan twins story lmao Episode went through a RPF self-insert phase :kek: F for the Clueless sequel Those both felt like silly fanfics but they at least had stories lmao Unlike the rest of Episode's "pregnant by my bad boy teacher gangster prince billionaire" crap I just looked up Cameron Dallas and apparently he got arrested for physical assault in 2018??? Boy that makes the Episode story awkward That's hilarious lmao Look at these terrifying faces I barely remember anything about the Cameron Dallas story but I do remember it was surprisingly kind of decent for a celebrity RPF lmao If it'd been an original story without the real life celebrity thing I think it would've been better It had a sort of interesting plot about your MC wanting to find her missing father If I had to see it so do you, apologies  LMAOOOO The celebrity representations in the Episode stories based on real people or actual movies/shows were really hit or miss Demi looked fine but the Mean Girls looked...weird Jhsmdfnkmh "The Most Dangerous Game with the Dolan Twins" Yeah it definitely got more accurate with Limelight because they could use more detailed shading Doesn't really explain why the Dolan twins look terrifying though lmao I mean that's just standard, Choices does it too And a lot of other apps I imagine Though unlike Choices Episode at least lets you customize your hairstyles in any way you want With Choices if you want straight black hair but don't like the one black hairstyle that isn't afro-textured...too bad lmao Yeah that was Writer LB Her stories were generally good even if some were...flawed This was the Hayes one This was the original cover for the Cameron Dallas one but it got changed to a different one later And yeah Andrea Elle's stories are great I love having a normal day until I remember the Wachowskis' gay Iraq War movie that never materialized and wonder what the hell happened to it, and if it'll ever see the light of day alongside The Matrix 4 Like ??? ???? What Oh okay lmao Can't wait for people to bombard it with questions about MW/Hero/It Lives/every other book Choices abandoned What I really don't get is why it's "celebrating" fucking...TNA of all books lmao Is it just because it's the only non-Witness book that recently finished?? It's all fun and games until you realize this guy is the only front-facing Choices sprite Therapist: Daniel the waiter isn't real, he can't hurt you
Daniel the waiter:  I love how it's in the middle of the book even though it's about the ending lmao I don't think there was a Blades Q&A?? Or did that go up earlier and I just missed it Wait never mind I see it now I'm dumb lmao I just noticed the icon change lmao It's what she deserves It was the most valid moment though Valid Unpopular opinion: I like cucumbers But...that's part of why I like them  They're cool and crunchy That's 100% valid (I've never had tuna lmao) I don't eat beef anymore because of environmental reasons Well, yes It's a heavy factor in the greenhouse gases affecting the planet That too Wait there's going to be yet another VIP book?? Damn they're really going all out lmao No that's not what I was talking about I meant the supernatural book Tfw non-VIPs are only getting a sequel no one asked for while VIPs get two new books Which one lmao Making fun of Episode stories for bad writing is like shooting fish in a barrel Wait so we're getting a political drama book?? PLEASE no analogues to current politics, I read Choices books to enjoy something away from reality I hope it's that. Just general political drama and no hamfisted comparisons to real life It would be interesting to play as a MC who's already in power and has to run day to day affairs I think that's a given in a political drama lmao I just don't want any attempts at "clever" commentary on real life politics or anything Do you not like WT or something lmao Why are you saying "preferably forever" Also Nancy Drew isn't a journalist So that's not a good comparison Editing Choices characters on real people's bodies has always been weird as hell though Imagine if you saw a photo of yourself and some mobile app character's face was edited on over yours Bro what AAAAAHHH I just checked and it's not compatible with my device anymore :Dopeyangry: Big F  I guess I gotta look into a mod now hsmdfgkhmh  What site did you download the mod APK from  Thank you!! :Dopeyhappy: At this point they should just post the script lmao Same goes for MW 2 Wasn't there news that they did have Hero 2 written, though? It was just the art that was the problem I'd eat mushrooms more if it weren't for the fact they make you produce gas I forgot the server purge was happening lmao But yeah, please take care of yourself first (and this goes for everyone obviously) What's your device?? Maybe it has something to do with the update? But apparently it only affected Androids so I'm not sure You should probably send a support ticket just in case Nice!!! Question, how do you save your progress to FB when you download the Choices mod?? I don't have the FB app on my phone, can I do it on desktop? Problem is Choices won't let me log in, when I open it it just tells me to upgrade I use my Google Play account for Choices, maybe that saves it?? Or at least I hope it does ...Okay but how do I save my progress to port it to the mod I have a Google Play account so I guess I could use that  Yeah then I dunno lmao I can't do that without logging in to Choices and Choices won't let me log in unless I upgrade my device which I can't do because it's no longer compatible with my Android though I...didn't download the APK though? Wolf Bride sounds like it's gonna be yet another genderlocked single LI smut book lmao Hopefully that's not the case PENNSYLVANIA IS BLUEEEE Elisa Lam's death wasn't mysterious. She was mentally ill and her death was a tragic accident, not a spooky mystery. Just want to get that out there. Anyway I name all my MCs after myself because I'm not creative enough to think of another name lmao Valid Valid honestly I ate three cups of ramen in a row the other day I just got an ant infestation in my room so that explains it LMAO In other news (and yes I got rid of the ants), here are puppies https://i.imgur.com/SDChd1O.gifv Are you guys still playing Among Us Thanks for hosting  Channel's quiet so have another photo of Bruce Lee because I love him How many chapters are there of that Episde story For some reason all the official ones have been really short The two gem options in a row lmao Classic "pay gems to be nice to the LI or be a jerk for free" set-up His [censored] must be *finger-lickin' good* Get Popeyes instead True Seconded, In-N-Out is great Unfortunately the one closest to me is closed  For some reason when I download the APK it just says it has a problem "parsing the package" Anyone know what's up with that?? Restarted and downloaded again, it still says the same thing I thought it was an Iggy Azalea lyric In seriousness, though, what do I do to fix the problem with the APK? It just says it has a problem parsing the package when I download it I allowed my phone to install apps from unknown sources, restarted my phone, it doesn't work I have an Android but it's not version 5 or higher so I'm afraid that might be the problem lmao I only tried to download the APK from the Andro site. Haven't tried others Andro Palace I'm only downloading the "basic" mod The one at the top, I don't know about the others like VIP Update on the bathroom situation: it's over, the guy got my apology and unlocked it, I got the upstairs bathroom back, God is real, thank you all  Is it just me or is the other server like...absurdly more negative than usual these days Every two days there's a fight about genderlocking lmao We've beaten this dead horse into the center of the earth Nice ~~I thought Blue and Silver were hot~~ Canon tbh Me @ yet another fight about gender-locking in the other server: Please god let this end Biggest mood Honestly I'm thinking of just leaving that server entirely lmao So much negativity and everyone's just bitching about how bad the new books are when not fighting about genderlock And the fact that they apparently had an "interrogation room" channel once like... YEAH I DUNNO LMAO Apparently it was, and I quote, "an invisible channel where we bring people to talk to the mods" Wait that was it?? Jesus Christ what a mess lmao It's a server, not a police state It was deleted But the fact it existed is uhhhh Telling I mean...either that or that They probably shine the big light in your face Like every cop show ever made But in seriousness that's just weird as shit to me lmao Like why have a whole channel when you could just...DM and explain what they did wrong?? Or kick them?? Or give out warnings or something Three strikes and you're out or whatever I dunno I just find it dumb What would that even be Saying racist slurs?? Harassing members?? In that case you just ban them Why bother giving another chance at all Omfg You're braver than any US marine :kek: Scroll up lmao You'd have to do some extreme shit to get into it, I imagine Probably best to make a throwaway burner account if you really want to do it lmao So you don't have to sacrifice your main I mean how would they do that Do some funky IP tracking shit?? Valid tbh Imagine the HSS cast taking on Mr. Redfield First thing Redfield does is impale Brian on a tree :kek: And in reverse to HSS cast taking on Redfield, imagine the ILITW cast having happy high school life HSS style shenanigans Everyone lives and nobody dies Also: ILB cast but with SK plot The MC and Elliot want to honor their dead parents but Elliot forgets the marinara sauce :kek: PM in TRR The royal coronation goes haywire when King/Queen Hayden is exposed as an android Imagine Maxwell with Bryce The sheer chaotic energy Mutual seething contempt for everyone around them Sienna and Hana have never-ending sweetness Olivia and Jackie snark at each other forever Now I'm disappointed this isn't a thing lmao Shame that Choices books stopped crossing over a long time ago LMAO You mean fanfics Those are just fanfics lmao You wouldn't need an artist though We have tons of resources to get Choices files and sprites from Only thing you need is a graphic novel engine to code the sprites in Like Ren'Py, maybe? I barely know what I'm talking about either  I know nothing of coding The last time books actually crossed over was when ES and Hero had the exact same setting lmao Complete with Rourke and Silas knowing and mentioning each other TH:M had it too but that was ending exclusive Tfw Hero will never come back from the war  Yeah in Fabien's ending, Mona and Kaneko show up IIRC That was cool Sonia's ending was cool too TH:M was good as a stand-alone though lmao Don't need a sequel And it's understandable it wouldn't get one because it has too many variables based on who you recruited I'd replay it if Choices started working again on my phone  Unfortunately the mod APK still isn't working for me LMAO Even Ansel doesn't deserve that comparison tbh Best ending is the one where you're with both Eris and Rye tbh I romanced Rye and Fabien lmao Valid tbh Landry's worse lmao At least Ansel was useful before he betrayed you Even before going turncoat Landry was just kind of there And the fact that he put patients' lives in danger over a grudge...that's way worse lmao I didn't even start book 2 :kek: When I heard about what happened with Raf I couldn't be bothered to go into it You could also pay to beat up the terrorists in TRR Same Is that a spoiler at this point lmao Also Metta I think you mean "kicked" lmao I miss the days when the MC could kick ass instead of throwing balls all the time  I'd kick Barthelemy in the balls tbh Hsmdfbghkdmg What would the equivalent of Infinity War/Endgame even be for the Choices verse The TRR crew calls in everyone in the Choices world to throw down with Barthelemy?? :kek: I mean I was joking but yes ES would be it but unfortunately it's finished and Hero still is in hiatus hell  Imagine a Hero sequel where you can get the ES MC back I'd pay actual diamonds for that Let the ES MC reunite with their friends!! LMAO Why are so many Choices outfits like that You get an outfit that seems practical and then it has a cut-out around the shoulders or stomach that ruins the whole thing So many diamond dresses are ruined because of that :kek: It looks pretty and then there's a way too high leg slit or random cut-out around the stomach or boobs Or both at the same time Remember in ES when you could buy a leaf bikini called a "warrior outfit" Like BRUH Not me I couldn't get one if I wanted to lmao Same I only went to San Francisco twice but I want to go again  Went there for the best sushi restaurant My mom's friend owns it I had an impossible burger Does that count Impossible burgers > regular burgers tbh It's basically fake meat lmao A bunch of plant fibers designed to taste like beef I like it personally The fact it has no beef is a bonus to me because it means more cows weren't killed And so it's more environmentally friendly No greenhouse gases I mean me honestly Fries are the best Cajun fries too It's it? Oh Never tried those but I've only had basic ice cream sandwiches And chocopies, which those also look like Chocopies are basically the Korean staple snack You live in New Jersey?? OH SMDNFKMHMH Sorry I forgot lmao For a second I was about to send my condolences California squad represent  The old server feels like a fever dream at this point tbh Only thing I remember from it is the conversation about how weirdly tonally dissonant MTFL is lmao Because unlike other high school books like HSS and ILITW, it has no real tone between "happy and fun" or "dark and edgy" and is bouncing all over the place They go on hiatus every time Ava seems to be an actual LI :kek: The daily chapter thing definitely hurts it PB hitting that reset button harder than the status quo being restored on a Saturday morning cartoon Also I just remembered something from that conversation earlier about making our own crossover stories, wasn't there someone a while back who released their own mod version of ES? I think it was in the other server though so I might be forgetting details Someone should ask them how they made that. It was definitely a changed fan version, I remember they talked about how they were considering removing a character for being unneeded Was it? I'm not sure but that might be them I think I tried to download it at the link they posted but it was dead/not working when I checked it, which was weird Wait really Who was it?? OH Yeah I checked, that was them God the male MC looks so boring next to Jake and Sean lmao Basic ass tux next to Jake's waistcoat and Sean's unbuttoned shirt ES was definitely the peak Great characters, amazing story, the way the choices impacted your relationships, it was all *(chef's kiss)* Estella and Quinn both looking like queens :dogeheart: I miss the shock at the CGs of the plot twists Rourke in the septic tank genuinely had me SHOOK ES's art style was so good and unique too No idea why people kept bitching about it lmao It was refreshing and stylized Hero  It's the only book that could continue ES's story too and it's in hiatus hell The handfasting was beautiful, even if it did kind of not make sense because the MC and their LI have only known each other for like, two weeks at that point lmao Jake winking during handfasting :dogeheart: That was literally the only reason lmao People wanted the characters to look like the "normal" Choices art style I guess But ES's different art style made it stand out, and it made it unique Unfortunately it looks like PB doesn't want to take gambles like that anymore lmao  Doesn't PB have a job posting looking for writers every now and then Apparently some apps take you writing stories on other apps as writing experience lmao I've seen Episode writers be hired to make stories for apps like Choices and I'm over here like god I wish that were me Choices is owned by Nexon now so their hiring standards might be different, or have changed It's okay Andie we're all clowns in this chat Debatable because ES MC is part of an actual ancient alien but Hero MC is also an alien Right now they're basically stranded on a planet together so at least they have time to find out :kek: ES MC can literally time travel though So it's a matter if you think superpowers are more or less powerful than being able to control time What about BOLAS MC More like
1. TRR MC with diamonds in book 3
2. ES MC
3. Hero MC
4. Everyone else
5000. Witness MC I'm right I think what makes Hero's hiatus worse is that they basically have book 2 written, it's the art that they don't have  But apparently they can't be bothered to just hire a new artist I guess That's 100% valid Be the hero we need and save us all from hiatus hell :kek: Sometimes I wish I was Jared, 19 https://twitter.com/Wheeler/status/1333894092225458182 What story is this lmao What's it called though Of course it's named after a Mariah Carey song They could at least rewrite the ending if they're going to make it a standalone, damn Just delete the mention of Hayley being killed in custody?? It's that simple I like the other girl's bun more Too bad that's not an option  LMAO Every Episode premium story really is like that though Beat the bad guy - 30 diamonds
Let them win - Free Why is she wearing that ugly ass dress Like I get it's supposed to be Christmas but sheesh At least wear a generic sexy Santa dress instead of that mess Who would pay diamonds to look like a Christmas tree LMAOOOO How long is this story?? Of course it does All the official Episode stories have been 12 chapters at most, for some reason Gotta love the diamond choice piling up like Witness too lmao PB would never do that because that'd mean the fans have incentive to quit instead of hanging on out of the hope of it continuing  Pfft but don't you know, that'd mean you might feel...gasp...guilty about romancing the LI The other girl HAS to be evil at all times I'm still at a loss as to what this story is exactly about Is it basically HFTH on steroids?? I...why are they a rockstar Why a documentary And why is it Christmas themed It's a Hallmark movie clearly Apparently there was one GOC LI story that did have female friends instead of male if you picked the female version of the LI, but that was...one lmao I think it was called something like "Loving the Tomboy" or whatever but it was as bad as you'd expect Mainly because the premise is based on the LI being an overprotective jackass towards you who tries to dictate that you can't date because you're his/her best friend's "kid sister" No it's weird because apparently your MC is the "tomboy" I don't know what that is and I don't want to know  The less I know the better  Lmao I'm getting flashbacks to that One Direction RPF that got turned into a Wattpad book and a cheap movie Deadass the funniest thing about it was that Harry Styles blocked the author on Twitter Isn't snobbery about the size of rooms something the mean girl's supposed to do, not the LI lmao Oh The only thing Episode has over Choices is the huge drag queen hairstyles I don't know or care about sports other than that time the Chicago Cubs won Sometimes I watch the World Cup and feel patriotic about the South Korean team but that's it lmao Nobody:
Me at a soccer match with the Korean team: DAEHAN MINGUK AAAAAAAAAAAAAA That was wild Speaking of Germany do y'all remember the Brazil vs Germany match It was an absolute tragedy back in 2014 but the jokes I saw about it were sublime Like "Let's change to the History Channel, I hear there Germany loses" Never forget that cheerleaders were originally male until WWII happened Nice Unfortunately male cheerleaders didn't have the skimpy outfits back then Ain't a powder puff what women used to apply to their faces in ladies' rooms F I never went to a game but I was forced to attend pep rallies Like everyone else My elementary school bully was on the football team so I avoided them all on principle It's okay though because he still looked ugly I felt VINDICATION God I wish The worst part was that his mom was co-workers with my mom so I had to hear about him LMAO They worked at the same hospital Valid tbh I didn't have a fun time in high school. I was too shy so I didn't have a lot of friends and I didn't have classes with people I was actually close to I wish I could be in college but Zoom will have to do Here we're all vibing I mean I'm sure you're not in the minority lmao Lots of people have a good time in high school. It's different for everybody I never had that much of a good time in public school in general Best experience was probably middle school but I didn't get to finish it because I moved and took online school At my high school there seemed to be a fight every single week and I never got to see one One time there was an incident with a Twitter account that shit-talked people at school so much that it got banned and got news reports about it And it turned out that not only were there two people running it, one of them was a dude in my biology class!! I missed all that drama :kek: I don't think I ever saw that guy in my class again lmao Oh my goddd The Twitter account at my school was called something like "SCHS hate tweets" In fact I'll get the news links about it https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article42896283.html https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article42896379.html Lmao Teens really be horny and stupid SMDFNKGMHS I remember when there were restrictions placed on the high school Chromebooks I'm like 90% sure I saw a dude somehow watching ||porn|| on his though Wild Jesus Christ how does that happen Shit, I wish *I* was top of the class and from a rich family and Ivy League bound With the parents I've had I'd be okay with at least having money Actually my sister had some wild stories about her boarding school in Korea but first have I ever mentioned the time I didn't go to that same boarding school because my mom didn't like one of the administrators She wanted me to go there but she changed her mind when we met the administrators and she hated how one of them kept staring at me and said he was creepy So she only let my sister go to the school after that administrator left lmao Imagine getting married and having a kid when you're barely old enough to drink Like no judgment to those who do that because they want to of course, but it just sounds...intimidating I'm 22 and the idea of having a kid right now fills me with fear God I wish that were me LMAO If you asked me 10 years ago what 22 year old me would be doing, I would've said I would be a successful and rich writer Little did I know how capitalism worked Valid If there's one thing I can take comfort in it's that I've always known I wanted to be a writer and that's never changed I was writing whole books on stapled papers with crayons when I was FIVE Write a cookbook so we can all cook like you Okay a bakebook Same idea First thing I'd do is camp outside, wait for whoever's eating all the cookies and cream, and then attack I can if it's over cookies and cream  I mean that works too I wish I lived in somebody's mind rent free I'll ask the owner which Liam they chose I keep forgetting that he's the second Imagine that once there was another terrifying baby Bartie Talking to people your age can be exhausting tbf Pixel Barry is clearly the executive responsible for greenlighting all the dumb smut books BaBu 2? That's Pixel Barry. TNA? Pixel Barry. Witness? Pixel Barry That's hilarious because I remember seeing someone whine and bitch about how one other person they didn't like was somehow to blame for the OH hiatus for criticizing it Implying that OH should never have gone on hiatus and the person was wrong for criticizing it to begin with (which they weren't) Same  I've had zingers since then that deserve to be immortalized 17 LMAO Off by 5 years https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z-Nu351j58 Adios sweet potato pie The name is Rys but for some reason even PB sometimes misspells it as Rhys Just looked that up and apparently it's some dude called RDAmbition Happy new year  How'd you do it though What the fuck did I come back to I mean valid Be sure to throw out all moldy bagels though Starboard LIVEEEEESSSSS Happy birthday!! Have any of you tried the Toon Me site? It's fucking incredible lmao Ah yes, surprised CGI me, weirdly yellow 2D me, sleep paralysis demon with blush filter me, and slightly more accurate 2D me Poppy would not at all be popular if she was black like Zoey lmao Also I've seen some people begging for Chloe to be a LI too like...wha Veronica I get but fucking Chloe lmao Petition to rename this server "capitalist yahoo land" I can never walk in high heels so I'm kin with that woman Can someone explain why you can't sign in with a Google Play account on the mod? I'm using Bluestacks so does it depend on the emulator...or  Is there a way to connect my Google account to my FB? I signed in with my FB No, it's completely new. Haven't used FB for Choices until now I'll ask support your question though LMAO Don't worry, I'm emailing them Do I have to say I want it deleted to get the save file from it moved to my FB? I mean, my Google account is basically disabled since I can't log into it on my phone or on the mod so it wouldn't be lying to say it was It's stuck on the Google account? The only device is my Android and it's outdated now because of the Choices update so no, unfortunately I can still log into my Google Play account on the store in Bluestacks. It just won't let me sign into Choices on it Yes Sorry if I wasn't being clearer. I thought by "disabled" you meant a problem with logging into it in general Aight, I sent the email. Hopefully it works, thanks for your help  Me: (makes the mistake of mentioning I get an error message when trying to sign in, not specifying I'm on a mod in Bluestacks)
Support: (asks for a screencap of the error message)
Me: I could just *say* that it says something like "error: couldn't connect to accounts.google.com" and hope they don't ask for a screencap LMAO The email did ask me to say what it says, not to provide a screenshot  Then I dunno It's not a made-up error message I've seen it before, just not on Bluestacks I saw it like...when I couldn't connect to Google while I had a faulty internet on my phone. But I'll admit that is probably not a better alternative I mean, I'm emailing them from the email I use for my Google Play account and FB Omfg I mean my idea was to just ghost for a couple months and email them again hoping I get a different support person The alternative is to just cave and buy a new Android I guess lmao ? The message I get is "code 10, message 10", looking that up nets mostly results about Bluestacks and some about Android so I don't think that'd help And do you mean install the clean version on Bluestacks instead of the mod? Wait, you can log in with your Google account into the normal version of Choices on Bluestacks?  From the store MOM HOLY FUCK Hsdfmgnhkhmh thanks now I know what to do I use my personal email so I don't think that'd work I think someone said something here about how you can link your Google and Facebook accounts on Choices by logging out of the Google one and then into the Facebook one? I don't remember the specifics but I'll try that I LOGGED IN Okay thank god my progress is still there lmao Now how do I connect it to my Facebook Right. I was just caught up in being elated my progress was still there For now I think I'll forget about the mod and just play on the emulator without it lmao. I'm glad to be back in Alright, thanks for your help. Good night! Damn, I missed the discussion about race earlier lmao Fair, I'll say that I'm definitely more biased towards Asian LIs because I'm Asian lmao. So it's kind of disappointing that the default customizable LI range is always the same white/black/Hispanic trio, and doesn't always include more options like south Asian or east Asian And I will say that customizable LIs seem to hurt diversity more than help it, because like what the survey posted earlier shows, people tend to pick the white face more often than not. Feels pointless to put the choice of diversity into the player's hands when the player usually doesn't even pick it Also, can PB *please* hire more Asian artists to design the Asian MC faces? So many of them look basically white with slightly narrower eyes :kek: Doesn't help that most of them tend to be east Asian and south Asian MC faces are still rare There's also how they use customizable LIs as a crutch for diversity rather than an add-on, meaning that if you don't pick the black version of the LI, there are no black LIs period. Like, if you don't choose black Liam in TRR, there are no black LIs at all And in MTFL, all three LIs are customizable, meaning it's entirely possible to make them all white Also I did some scrolling up and who the fuck is this Lin Phan person lmao What an idiot lmao That'd be cool F :marafrogemoji: Tag yourself I'm "I am shy guys" I just assume everyone's Discord names are their real names tbh What do you mean your real birth name isn't literally Chaotic Founder Wizard Pri Lmao thanks Kio is from me intentionally misspelling Koi, which was my nickname on a forum I used as a kid Verity was the name of a heroine in one of my old story ideas :marafrogemoji: And BBC also means something else Of course Definitely the only thing it means :marafrogemoji: I only know Ike from his appearance in Super Smash Bros Brawl (2008) so that's valid I thought he was the prettiest blue haired swordsman anime boy who fought for his friends :dogeheart: Nice Valid I don't remember why I signed up for Discord It was just the new thing Omfg Which one Ah yes The dreaded "author doesn't finish the story" syndrome Most common with fanfics and anything people are writing for free You talked to him?? Holy shit lmao I remember the last time I pestered an author was when I was like. 10 I found the email address of a children's book author and pestered that poor woman mercilessly I literally asked her for relationship advice about a boy :kek: And for some reason she actually replied to me and was nice instead of just ignoring me LMAO I know but goddamn I would not have had that much patience if I were her, she was amazing I'm glad someone else appreciates V for Vendetta :dogekek: LMAO Is there a Google drive for files of the speech bubbles/text in the books?  Link please Late but damn, PB really pulled the trigger huh lmao. Wonder how people are reacting on Tumblr right now Anyway mood: Personally the only book I'm surprised that got canceled is ROD. We all knew MW and Hero have been unfortunately dead in the water for years, but ROD too? You're telling me a bad boy book didn't go over with the FB moms?? Wha Also lmfao @ the shade about how "the book you hate might be the one that's popular and keeping the lights on for us!!" Like aight but that still doesn't make it...good...?? I don't understand what the point of this part was. "Shame on you for hating books that keep us in business, uncritically consume our products pls"? Still sucks that they're only being clear now instead of admitting upfront their problems with making the requested sequels to begin with. They really kept stringing fans along over and over But better late than never, I guess? Tfw MW and Hero won't get sequels but TNA will  You hate to see it Lmao I mean, you'd think PB would be able to tell which books only get views for diamond mining based on how many diamonds people actually spend in them (read: zero) But the dissonance between FB moms and online fans drags on I guess Prayer circle BOLAS book 2 won't be taken out behind the shed and shot like all these other canceled books  Yeah that kind of system sounds likely It still makes no damn sense. Didn't they say Hero 2 had a finished script, just not assets? The least they could do is release the script at least so people can get a small form of closure Shit you're right Okay but my point still stands lmao, I find it hard to believe none of them ever drafted up scripts even if the book itself didn't get released, or finished. If you don't have a finished script then...let the original writers talk about what they wanted to write, or *how* they would have ended the whole story Books like BOLAS are just once in a lifetime blue moon opportunities I guess. Get ready for another big, epic scale book only in 2030 :kek: Right? Come on, you owe the fans that much for the diamonds and time they spent At least tell us who killed Hayley Rose  LMAO Yeah, Hero wasn't perfect but it deserved to have its story finished. And it was also an extension of ES so it never being continued means part of ES's story won't be resolved I know  Tfw we will never get another book with an experimental art style like ES and Hero  The OG books definitely look more...unique than the current books in their overly realistic art style A lot more front-facing characters, for starters Kind of wish they'd go back to that, it made them look varied What ??? Why would it be scary Never forget that James and Sebastian were originally just Michael B. Jordan and Eddie Redmayne :kek: But anyway back to the topic Let the writers of the canceled books talk about their plans for the sequels  It's what  the fans  deserve  Or hell, just release whatever new assets were made for the sequels (if there even were any to begin with) and let the fans go nuts. If PB won't make the sequels then let us make them :kek: Or if they're not going to do that, then at least rewrite MW and Hero's endings to take out the cliffhangers, goddamn They would've worked fine as stand-alones if they hadn't thrown in the cliffhanger at the last second Oh lmao it's just for artists Sometimes they put up an ad for writers once in aw hile OH PB just tell us what IL3 would've been about challenge Or at least tell us who  killed  Hayley  Rose  :kek: Tfw Hero 2 never being released means we will never get to rock Caleb  Big F for what could've been Me and the squad on our way to pull a heist at PB headquarters to get the unreleased scripts for MW 2, Hero 2, ROD 2, and IL 3 Not y'all turning my joke about a heist into a conversation about idiots who break lockdown :kek: Jhsdbfmngkhm Just order bubble tea from home!!! And good, I want in on that squad operation :dogekek: I mean yes but Oh man that reminds me of one time I passed a tennis court with six people and NONE of them were wearing masks Absolute insanity Boomers are just like that https://zigsnose.tumblr.com/post/641058959828123649/ No matter how much I complain about it I'm sticking with Choices to the bitter end unfortunately Going down with the ship  They knew what they were doing when they rolled out the challenges immediately lmao Trying to placate all the salty fans with diamonds like it's a bread and circuses show :kek: Female Asian ES MC's eyes were dark gray, not green...I think Slightly off-topic but why were the black ES MC's lips pink It looks weird Gay Lmao what Who was this guy and what kind of bad self-insert fanfic did he write UHHHHHHH That's a big fucking yikes from me What'd he do to get booted Post yet another bad fanfic?? Bruh I just took a peek at it in the other server and WHAT was this weirdo's deal lmao Seems like a creepy overly invested teenager, no wonder he got banned That's so weird, what was he DMing you lmao Oh dear Did you block him at least I would've blocked him after the very first DM :kek: You're as patient as a saint JSMDNFKGMHFNGMH You just gave me war flashbacks Pri Of course he was from the Morella server LMAO That place was full of weirdos and creeps Never forget the time the admin faked a coming out as a "prank" and then threw a tantrum when people didn't find it funny Sounds like he was clingy and desperate for validation because no one else would listen to his shit lmao Him being under 18 definitely explains his immature behavior He's just a stupid teen, if he were over 20 then that'd be cause for genuine concern Hopefully he grows up Lmaoooo What Why'd he hate that one book so much lmao Again...overly invested Being banned was probably the best for him Maybe he took it as a lesson to stop being so weird and overly invested LMAO What even happened to that stupid server anyway Do they still have invites closed?? Lmfao wow They really gave up on it huh Ten bucks says the server gets deleted before Blades 2 gets released Sdmfngkmh What the fuck do they even talk about in there "Omg this collection of pixels who only exists to bully the MC and occasionally hate-flirt with her is so hawt pls date me " Ew What did Poppy do to inspire this level of creepy cult-like devotion lmao Like she isn't even real and I'm low key concerned for her safety right now?? :kek: These people are just Benji and the server is their mashed potato head I didn't say she was, I just feel automatically concerned for (almost) anyone with a creepy cult-like following LMAO People weren't this weird even over better developed mean girl characters like Becca Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave These people are just the Robin stans 2.0 I mean in terms of creepily stanning a secondary non-LI character I'm just thinking of that one dude who was an obsessive Robin stan and they sound exactly the same :kek: All this weird and unwarranted fixating on a collection of pixels One of my mutuals became a stupid Poppy stan for several days and I lost respect for her over it tbh Thank god she only limited it to some dumb reblogs and never talked shit about Zoey Bel's really out here cheating the system to get us all free diamonds :kek: Is Witness improved at all if you play it with all the diamond options chosen God that makes it even worse Imagine paying for the story and MC to be decent Hopefully she's just taking a break Imagine being a 12-year-old and opening TNA to see a whole sex dream literally two seconds into the first chapter :kek: Valid Late but that sleep schedule is valid Recently I keep dropping off at 10 and waking up at 7am, which should be good but Rest in peace, Christopher Plummer https://media1.tenor.com/images/bfd1df8d74cf9bb89874f9c6bc0ca4af/tenor.gif?itemid=15157509 What would Hero 2 have even been about is the real question How would MC have gotten off of the alien planet?? Would Vaanu have shown up?? So many questions, none answered   Oh dear How'd that happen?? Good night! Did someone say road trip  Let's get an RV and ride around in it I haven't had clam chowder in ages so I'm down It was delicious last time I had it :DogeLick: Damn Bel I didn't know you were lying about being Asian all along What next, are you gonna turn out to be an Oompa Loompa  Probably All those K-pop stans claiming they're one-fourth Korean or some shit I'll only show my face to those of you whom I trust I'd never show it here publicly. Too much of a chance of weirdos lurking lmao I'm sorry to disappoint you but Jiji from Kiki's Delivery Service isn't my actual face I was joking I've never posted my face here See what I did what Fair So what do you have to tell support to get them to link your Google and FB accounts Did Tumblr just go fucking white The entire background is white now?? I just clicked on my likes and it suddenly changed to white for no reason Tbf a lot of the teeth showing smiles look weird Of course even more Fire Emblem characters would be added to Smash Bros :kek: That's valid tbh Bad Also confused Like WHO is so invested in side characters' love lives so much that you make a whole ass edit over it :kek: If you wish a gay side character was a LI for your MC that's one thing (and it's fine, as long as you respect the side character being gay and don't say homophobic shit about it), but wanting a gay side character to be straight for...another side character...like bro what LMAO Empty words to ward off being called homophobic Even then it's still weird and suspicious as fuck She just shouldn't have made the edit, period Or at least kept it private and shared it only with her friends instead of posting it and clowning in public LMAO Deadass exactly what she did Devil's devil's advocate: that's false equivalency. There are millions and millions of straight characters in mainstream fiction and media, there aren't nearly as many LGBT characters Making a LGBT character straight is not the same as going "tee hee I think the straight male hero would make a cute couple with his straight best friend" It's also...you know...homophobic to look at a woman who canonically has a female partner and go "Okay yeah but what if she was MARRIED to a MAN" Thanks for listening Mood Did it go well I'm fond of :DogeLick: myself And :dogeheart: :dogekek: :dogewink: :hmm: Support just asked me if I want to merge progress or just link my game to both @ everyone who got their FB accounts linked and modded: what do I say :hmm: Okay but who even does that to a watermelon though :kek: Just eat the plain watermelon!! Happy birthday!! ...what Link?? Hashtag okay then I mean good for them and their enthusiasm, but I'm leery because mainstream news coverage has almost never been kind to fandoms and usually paints them as weirdos or crazy shippers to point and laugh at That's if this is even a real Wired journalist lmao I was already kind of skeptical but yeah, it does look really fake now that you all point it out I could see Buzzfeed doing a piece about Choices fans, but definitely not Wired lmao I'm fine with you all knowing my first name at least lmao I might've posted it in a screenshot of my MC once a million years ago :judgeyfroge: It's Joanne lol Not Joan, Joanna, or Jo Anne, as it's so often been confused with :kek: Actually I was named after an author, sort of A Korean businesswoman who wrote a book I'd link the Wikipedia article but it's in Korean  Noice Being named after a goddess would be the easiest way to send a kid on a power trip tbf All the plebeians are named Alice or Mary or Carol and you're named after a deity who can kill people with flaming arms  It's a joke lmao White people be like "You can't name your kid Jesus, that's HERESY!!" and Hispanic people name their sons Jess on the daily Is your surname Doge F for dogekek, gone but not forgotten Someone say what it is so I don't have to go on my phone LMAO Bro it's just a shitposting bot channel, don't think too hard about what's said in there LMAO They could've at least chosen a MLM pairing for ES instead of using the most typical straight dude choice lmfao This isn't a knock against Quinn, I love her but she attracts the weirdest straight dude players Like that one dudebro in the Choices subreddit who made a rambling ass post about how he chose Quinn because she was exactly like his ex-girlfriend...my guy PLEASE shut up No now you gotta spill the details With the PB merch you'd think they'd at least make a Threep plushie  Have any of you had malts Chocolate malts are  The mere mention of Flappy Bird gives me war flashbacks Watch them only look at the writing samples about ~steamy romance~ and ignore the ones about friendship lmao I was thinking of HSS lmao Guess who forgot it was spring break and tried to join my Zoom class :kek: Let's not compare PB to an actual corrupt leader, thanks LMAO That's not a funny April Fools' joke lmao A funny one would've been announcing a new smut book called "April Fools' Baby" Oh I just noticed that Why is it gone?? https://twitter.com/princesslahela/status/1379514236754354185 https://tenor.com/view/kermit-sips-tea-tea-gif-8953704 "K-pop vampire lover" sounds like a game of Mad Libs Who? Got summoned for jury duty, lads How do I get out of it  LMAO No but seriously, what do I do I take college classes on Zoom, if that counts How does that happen lmao Not me finding out that Chapters disabled the endless diamonds cheat and made it impossible to mod and that's why the mod I was using hasn't updated...on a Choices blog  Are you talking about the "lucky" patch lmao Yeah I heard  How'd you patch it though https://tenor.com/view/calculation-math-hangover-allen-zach-galifianakis-gif-6219070 ...okay Alright, thanks  Are you talking about "Finding Master Right" lmao The scanner I ordered arrived today and now I just have to figure out how to actually use it lmao I have to input a SMTP if I want to send scanned drawings to my email address, apparently Does anyone have gifs of the "animated" scenes in Choices, like the waterfall animation (you know the one lmao)? Asking because I don't think I've seen those, even in file drives Yeah that's what I thought, but I was curious That's interesting to know "A sexy companion" makes me leery because it sounds like it's saying Shipwrecked is going to be single-LI lmao Wake the Dead sounds like a cool title though Do you mean you want to play as a zombie LMAO More reason to use Verdana instead obviously Me at the mods' channels: https://tenor.com/view/let-me-in-eric-andre-wanna-come-in-gif-13730108 That was the plot of the sequel, wasn't it :kek: Someone posted this on the Choices wiki forum Living in California be like

BRO WHAT THE FUCK AM I LOOKING AT LMAO God I hope not The tweet got reported at least Adorable, looks like a Ghibli movie :dogeheart: Does anyone know any good artists who are open to commissions right now? Asking for...reasons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UREUvuS2MsA You know you've been talking to Metta too much when you find out an actor is a Clippers fan and your first thought is "Metta wouldn't like this" lmao Wanna guess who it is :kek: Daniel Henney But Metta, if someone had a gun to your head and said you had to cheer for either the Clippers or the Suns, which would you pick You gotta pick your POISON What was the bet Voltra's a traitor confirmed Metta what're your thoughts on the Bucks @Metta Do you think they'll win though :judgeyfroge: Nice How's it feel being a prophet  Take pictures @Metta So how's the game going Nice This feels apt LMAO Yeah the Arcana devs are shady as fuck at best and scammers at worst lmao Don't support them Arcana, more like Ar-crap-a, am I right :kek: Where's the screencap lmao Mobile app ads are always bizarre Like...hold on let me find this one article I found about one https://kotaku.com/horny-looking-game-actually-just-a-series-of-menus-1833784042 Expecting a low quality app game to have more than one female sprite? Impossible :kek: Actually what makes it funny is all the angry reviews on those kinds of games in the app store "This game is nothing like the ad said it would be!!" Why'd you even like the ad enough to play the game to begin with, weirdo Wait no this was the original article I was looking for https://erinfenton.medium.com/game-of-sultans-a-video-game-book-report-1e726708367b CST: Can't Stop Tapdancing PST: Peeing on Stinky Twerkers LMAO PST: Pero Stop Twerking Oooh, are we all going to SF Count me in Let's get a trailer and we can hit the road :dogewink: Remember that time Ethan stans swarmed his Instagram and told him he looked like a video game character and he was like "Oh, is it Mario???" Hilarious He only knew they were comparing him to a video game character so Mario was the only one he could think of LMAO Someone hasn't seen the "feet pics" wikis :kek: Yes those exist Don't advertise your fanfiction Voltra Choices fanfiction is weird because 99% of it is just people writing about their MCs with whatever love interests they like so you're always reading somebody else's self-insert fanfic lmao The 1% is the rare time people write about other characters who aren't the MC I get the joke but a book doesn't have a "insert your name here" function for the main character lol So you're always reading about a MC with a different name Uh...I dunno lmao I'm not sure what you mean What I mean is that they give the MC their own personality. I wasn't talking about the LIs Choices MCs are always blank slates so you can project onto them, is what I mean. Sometimes some books try to hint at personality traits for the MC (TRR is the first that comes to mind but there are others), but for the most part you're supposed to imagine their personality I...guess? Yes, some MCs have set backgrounds and backstories (ES, Hero, TE, among others) but not all of them, and you're still supposed to make up your own personality for them. That's where the self-inserting comes in It's easier for stuff like OH where the MC has no set backstory and you're free to make up whatever you want Lmfao Battle of the huge fiveheads Hope you're doing alright, Adam They probably don't get the main thing that annoys people is that they went back on their word. Giving VIP members special treatment is expected, changing their minds at best or outright lying at worst is shitty Lettuce is good for you though  Thank you!! :Dopeyhappy: Love you all :dogeheart: Him... Never forget that Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth were voted to be one of the top couples in gaming This is canon dialogue by the way Tweet it to Gordon Ramsay and see if he'll respond lmao But in seriousness nice job!

No bright spots at all unlike Train to Busan Yep He preferred the movie's ending lmao Yes Admittedly the original story didn't really have an ending So that might be another reason he preferred the movie Anyway I could go on a whole rant about how native Asians have completely different standards and don't care about "whitewashing", buuut that's an argument for another day lmao That's completely valid and I agree with you, but that's not how they see it unfortunately I'm a werewolf eyyy Poor Metta's still a mere peacekeeper Lmao Hashtag Megamind did nothing wrong It was obviously Tighten's fault THERE IS NO EASTER BUNNY, THERE IS NO TOOTH FAIRY, AND THERE IS NO SPOILERLAND 1 Who was Zak Oof Should we??

I could've sworn some of the Ghibli movies went on HBO Max Actually while I was talking about the Onceler movie earlier I should've mentioned that time I Googled the username of a fanfic author I once hate-read back in the day because her fanfics were all really laugh-worthy, stupid level of bad and I found out that she's now active on AO3 and the reason she hasn't been updating her poorly written anime fanfics is because she's now writing fanfics for Trolls, of all fucking things That sure was something And what's worse They were rated E for explicit ~~Did you mean the Gospels~~ Me scrolling through Charity Buzz and looking at all the auctions for pitch meetings with producers and directors and being like Don't compare yourself to a potato Drew That has real implications LMAO Happy birthday! Watch Ever After One of the best versions (if not THE best) of Cinderella imo :dogeheart: You guys are literally spamming up the chat lmao She is though Drowning people is very soothing :judgeyfroge: MILG MILG Mother I'd Like to Give gifts to Why did the title change to "Evil Chestnut" LMAO Everything is evil now I guess I beat you to it  PROOF  Evil PB: We'll go back to making books with actual plots and diverse genres! No more bland smut  1001 is weird about what it chooses to change Literally every black character was turned white except Rowan from TC&TF I'd guess the whitewashing was to (god help me) make black LIs look more "attractive", but Kiara isn't even a LI and was whitewashed anyway. So ????? The cynic in me wonders if Rowan was allowed to stay black because she can become an antagonist if you pick certain choices Hence the "darker skinned people = evil" stereotype China (and the other East Asian countries, for that matter) has always historically prized pale skin, so that, combined with being racially homogenous, means they have problems with their treatment of black people/characters You can see it in the Southeast too, like the Philippines, with the way that being part-white and thus lighter-skinned is seen as "better" That's just a mild California sun tan But at least he's allowed to have some small measure of melanin  Poor Principal Hughes  Turned into a white woman who was dipped in tea They also lightened his skin even though he was already a light skinned Asian LMAO It's so arbitrary It sucks because I'd actually like this art style if it weren't for the whitewashing crap It's anime-esque without being overly cutesy about it If they'd just kept all the characters' skin tones, and at least tried to keep some features similar, I would like it LMAO Wait is that supposed to be Caleb  Yeah, that...speaks for itself How convenient that Caleb is only popular with players when he's whitewashed :PleasePBJustStop: Guarantee you they'll remove his stubble lmao LMAO To make him like a generic anime boy He actually doesn't look that bad lmao Valid Presented without comment Guess :pixelbartie: Just got back from work So tired Every time I see the word albedo I just think of the edgy alien clone from Ben 10 Absolute loser king You guys wanna hear something funny Today I walked all the way to work and got to the building before I realized I was wearing sandals instead of my uniform shoes So I had to go back and change and then walk back again Oh man are we shit-talking the joke that is the Choices wiki again Because boy do I have something to show you all Where do I fucking begin LMAO What a whiny loser. "tHeY aLrEaDy kIlLeD tHeIr MaLe aUdIeNcE" Bro shut the hell up I'll bet you that's a Straight Dude talking Straight dudes are really unpleasable huh, if you make genderlocked books they whine about it being genderlocked and when you make GOC books they whine you should just stop making GOC books because...you made genderlocked ones?? But you wanted GOC?? Now you don't?? Make it make sense Doesn't help that PB encourages you to self-insert lmao They let you pick your gender, appearance, and name in GOC books, that's enough for people to go crazy :kek: I'm sorry WHAT LMAO For men claiming they "don't cry" they sure throw tantrums when a young teenage boy shows emotions that aren't seething rage or vague happiness Also I'm sure none of these men are 14-year-olds either yet they played a high school book with that exact premise  SMDNFKGMHNDJDM Shut the fuck up I saw someone on Twitter with an "Aiden Zhou is my malewife" username and a PFP of him Photoshopped into what looked like a strapless top Honey that's an underage teen boy, stop being a creep LMAOOOOOOO The sheer hypocrisy "Smut books are bad unless they cater only to ME!!!" https://tenor.com/view/wendy-tea-gif-4951376 You're right Though that lends itself to a whole other brand of Discourse I don't want to get into right now lmao Infantilization is really the only way to describe how they write all sorts of creepy fanfics about [insert K-pop male idol here] doesn't know what a p*nis is Like ma'am these are grown 20-something men, I assure you they've gotten laid at some point in their lives :kek: Don't roast yourself like that Bel It's because they're white girls who don't see Asians as people  LMFAO Metta's closet leaked  What kind of drama You gotta spill Tumblr.

*I AM FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM THE TWITTER FEED OF PB* ???????? That cis female Chris is giving me the creeps What do they even use to make those creepy things?? How do you look at that and say "Yeah this is what all the female characters should look like" How many times has she used the  emoji If I had a nickel every time for it I'd have a yacht and you all could party on it She uses emojis like punctuation LMAO Someone ought to make a bingo about MLF's posts One space for her gushing about [insert male LI here] Another space for her rampant emoji use Third space for one overly long run-on sentence .img ethan ramsey writers OH FINALLY LMAO Pictured: Pixelberry writers' room, colorized That's a dope blanket .img ethan giraffe He looks like he's from a Choices ad All that weird pseudo-animation they got going on :kek: I keep forgetting Reddit even has a chat server Or wait do you mean the subreddit Discord?? Oh BAD He looks like that dude who got surgery to look like Ken LMAOOOOOO WHY DOESN'T HIS NECK MATCH HIS FACE Oh yeah and the face is bad too lmao Frat's on a mission to make us like Choices again by showing how the sprites could be so much worse Conspiracy theory: Frat is a PB employee in disguise Fess up, Frat Did Nexon send you :KEKWhands: Metta on his way to infiltrate PB to force them to make more TRR sequels Metta succeeds and takes over PB. The Royal Princess is announced. Somewhere far away, Choices players all explode He looks like a goddamn YA vampire boy In the worst possible way LMAO JINX NO :kek: Don't encourage Frat Who're you doing this to next Frat Gaius Gaius and Oliver Ooh yeah, I got an iPad recently My mom wouldn't like Choices lmao "Why are there SEX SCENES??? These people aren't MARRIED???" She's also a nurse so OH would make her explode "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU CAN ROMANCE YOUR DOCTOR?? THIS IS UNETHICAL" So has mine but she's never really liked it lol LMFAO He doesn't look that different tbh Just exaggerated cheekbones and lips Tag yourself I'm ">10 emoji" Metta: *breathes*
Everyone in this server: HAHA YOU LIKE CARTER I'm rooting for you Metta I didn't know he had a fat pet donkey Okay Frat we get it, you're a teacher simp "Too much smut" "Why genderlocked to female MCs I wanna be a man grrrrr" Poor Chastin lmao Imagine harassing an intern over something they can't control instead of doing literally anything else :raifepain: I just don't understand what these idiots expect to get out of this Like...do they not realize the writers and executives don't run PB's social media and they're just yelling at some underpaid interns?? You can tell this is a Straight Dudebro because he only named Estella and Quinn and completely ignored Sean and Jake lmao That had to be deliberate Also the last part makes me laugh "Decisions in choices don't really matter now" Dude...did they ever? Even in ES, your choices in the end boil down to three separate endings. Even if you fuck up and get all the characters to hate you, they'll still mourn you if you pick the sacrifice ending or stay with you if you pick the Endless ending And in IL, the biggest change you get is based on which characters die or live. The ending still bases itself on who becomes Redfield Yeah, but that's what I mean. In those it was more about *feeling* like your choices actually affected things, rather than actually radically changing anything Those books have been out for a million years, I'm not spoiling anything LMAO B-b-but Metta How else will he have his voice heard by an intern who has nothing to do with the books he's whining about  If this is bad how many times do you think the interns have to get this exact kind of message per day LMAO They're interns  They don't get paid enough Actual picture of PB intern receiving the 1838990849th "WHY GENDERLOCKED BOOKS " message: The CGI Keanu Reeves PFP really makes that comment MM couldn't be GOC because the very title relies on it being genderlocked lmao Like, would the title magically change to "Mr. Match" somehow if you had a male MC?? That'd be nice, but let's be real, PB would never go to that much effort Unless it was like that Too bad Originals is dead  Choices would have to incorporate new coding to have that kind of feature Originals had full-body moving sprites, Choices...doesn't have that Not gonna lie Originals' art style was kind of weird The sprites were so stylized and had exaggerated proportions with big heads but they had bizarrely realistic shading That reminds me, why didn't it ever get released in the US? It never even made it out of beta .img john tull I'm familiar with it Never forget the time Wrightworth was voted as one of the most popular gaming couples Absolutely iconic Wrightworth is canon LMAO #cursed-chat Is that a fucking himbo flag Implying you had any to begin with At this point extensions are gonna be our only way to make any social media site usable I've been using an extension to force Twitter back into the old format for over a year now LMAO It's called GoodTwitter Would make a lot of sense Drink whatever you want Stay strong everybody I like how this implies 2021 invented TikTok dances Yeah we totally didn't see those before @Metta This you? How do you eat all that in one go though :blobsweat: You're right, instead you eat some and then hoard the rest like a squirrel storing nuts for winter This is probably a weird question but where'd you get your Reddit username from? Does Goku eating ants have an origin story Ooh, that's really cool actually Meanwhile I just smash random words together lmao Was your original username LakersLoverBoy69 The joke is Metta would die for the Lakers This obviously means Pri is UwU I used to be all about Backyardigans and now I remember absolutely nothing about it but some character designs What's he look like How'd you not fall?? Metta only wishes he could fall into Carter's waiting arms ~~In more ways than one I'm sure~~ Let a man be versatile No Hewwo uwu Hi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCbxv9dN_YM I haven't had a Happy Meal in a million years If you just order nuggets with fries and a burger it's basically that I don't want to be that person, but going over MLF's posts to "edit" them and fix her grammar mistakes strikes me as unnecessary. English probably isn't her first language Like, it's fine to make fun of her bad takes and weird emoji spamming but let's not mock her English speaking abilities. I get that, but my point is it's not necessary to nitpick her posts for grammar errors and weird sentence construction. It feels mean-spirited because she doesnt seem to be a native English speaker and it's not needed "Who the f voted Ethan"

We're all on the same page here about wishing her well Good, I hope My condolences I'm just glad he's on there at all LMAO The hate circlejerk for TRH makes people forget Liam was probably the most popular LI when TRR was running Happy birthday Adam!!

They know exactly what they're doing Like that one white woman who called a cop and claimed a black boy sexually harassed her just because his backpack bumped against her A LITTLE BOY, mind you And of course, she only apologized after being nationally shamed in the media for weeks LMAO Throwback to the times a friend of mine and I hated Comcast so much as kids for always cutting out our internet that we RPed beating up a villain literally called "Evil Comcast Lady" Non-Americans who find out about Freedober must be taken out by government snipers For a second I thought that was Hayao Miyazaki and I was so confused lmao It was the square glasses and beard Imagine being in middle school One of us, one of us https://i.gifer.com/7PFN.gif This is just stolen from a Tumblr post  Relatable Why would I want someone to look at me like they want to eat me Wouldn't want a real life Sam either lmao Dating a billionaire sounds exhausting bro Because I like my organs INTACT What would you even talk about? "Hi honey, how many employees did you lay off today"?? So romantic you guys :KEK: Okay but am I wrong LMAO (I kid obviously, date whoever you want, y'all) You're saying you wouldn't be satisfied eating Bezos? Perhaps He looks greasy as fuck though so I probably wouldn't Okay but so do Tik Tokers who get 1 million views on their videos of them dancing Unless they're rich too I don't know How wealthy is your average 14-year-old Tik Toker LMAOOOO Exactly I'm sure they make a lot of money before they inevitably get canceled when someone digs up a racist tweet they made when they were 15 Lol You're not wrong But we're all stuck with Tik Tok as long as YouTube keeps making the stupidest changes and driving more content creators away Careful Metta, you're leaking the Matrix Agent Smith will be after you any second now Smdfmgnhkm wait I actually read the description and it's real??? I thought "celebrity meat" meant like...luxury brand meat like wagyu beef or something BUT THEY'RE PLANNING TO PUT CELEBRITY DNA INTO MEAT WHAT LMFAO WHO WANTS TO EAT THAT "Mmm yeah this sausage made from a strand of Tom Holland's hair is fantastic" I'm sure the K-pop stans would sell their arms for the money to buy it if that brand extended internationally Hope it never does Eminem was a prophet when he wrote "Stan" Truly a man ahead of his time Metta can be rude as he wants Hashtag free speech Kinky Stan is a portmanteau of "stalker" and "fan" lmao People now use it not knowing where it even came from, language is truly a gift When did the nicknames in this server all become about pie Never had peach mango pie myself Only one year off from my age, but wrong sign lmao Can you call customer service and ask about it? You should be able to get an update if it's been delayed Maybe try calling again? I could've sworn some other apps plagiarized/stole assets from Choices' files too Chapters did have some things that were...suspiciously similar to Choices. Stuff like clothes and the way some MCs' hands were posed Constant work mood All I know about it are the memes Reminds me of a tweet I saw I married Santa Claus because it's my hobby Weird flex but okay It starts and ends with "making your own main character fosters an entitlement complex because it's all about wish fulfillment" Games with customizable MCs in general have that problem in their fanbases Fallout, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Elder Scrolls, SWTOR, FFXIV, if it has a big and "epic" story and allows you to customize your character whom the story revolves around, it's gonna spawn overly attached crazies LMAO Let's be real, that's the biggest reason the forced LI debate always gets weird and creepily personal People always gotta take things as personal attacks Why do you think side characters who show a hint of snippiness towards the MC and aren't conventionally attractive or "desirable" get so much hate Especially black female characters You just reminded me of that "MC starter pack" meme I saw on the subreddit once lmao Only thing I remember from it is "Random female character who hates you for no reason" and honestly...where's the lie Valid As for Sofia, I'm sure PB will throw in a last-minute diamond scene option for her at some point lmao They gotta pander to everybody LOL Metta's out here saying "No Sofia and Robin stan rights allowed" Bitches be like "Ugh ANOTHER romance book?? " and then spam 20 posts in a row of their favorite LI like "My boyfriend " Like aight Okay but the MOTY daughter is fictional and cute, unlike real and annoying children lmao Bitches be like "The white male LIs are all so forced " and then exclusively go for the white male LIs and nobody else anyway People just assumed Adrian was straight because he had a wife lmao Never mind that it's possible for him to both be bisexual and attracted to two women Thinking about that one Ethan stan who said "Ethan would totally support BLM " as if Rafael doesn't exist and isn't right there I just thought it was bizarre they didn't mention the actual black LI lmao Like if there was no black LI then whatever, but...it was weird to me is all ??? What does that have to do with BLM Dare we ????? I wasn't talking about Raf? I was talking about the person, and the fact that Raf exists and I thought it was weird they didn't acknowledge him Raf and Ethan are fictional characters, they have no opinion on BLM because they don't exist I was talking about the person who said that. Raf himself was not the point Again, I just thought it was bizarre. Ethan and Raf are fictional characters who can't have opinions on BLM because they aren't real. That's why I thought it was weird for this person to say Ethan would support BLM and ignore Raf, the actual black person who would be likelier (though NOT guaranteed, that's not what I meant) to do that. It was just supposed to be a snarky off-hand comment. I didn't mean to imply anything deeper. Voltra: Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of moving away, you're coming right to me?
Aaron: I can't dance the shit out of you without getting closer.
Voltra: Hoho! Then come as close as you like Drew out here being the dance choreographer with the vivid imagination LMAO I only know the meme Thanks king :dogeheart: Aurynn's sprite always looked kind of off and now I realize why It's because she's the only non-MC sprite who faces right LMAO NPC sprites always face left, the MC faces right I kind of miss when Choices sprites were more unique like that Now they all look pretty homogenous because it's cheaper to just rearrange features and recolor rather than make entirely new sprite bodies Oh yeah, that was a really cool sprite ES MC is also unique for being the only MC sprite to this day to have the hands on hips pose I mean, it fits LMAO She's supposed to look creepy Being a villain and all Margaret is definitely a unique sprite too Can't recall many that have their hands clasped in front like that PB wouldn't reuse that for a male MC because then we wouldn't be able to see the diamond outfits  The funniest file name joke is still Maxwell's file literally being "sleazy Middle Eastern guy" Like I know it's because he's a reuse but lmao YES But Maxwell's not sleazy  Thanks Bel lmao Yeah, that's the only reason it's called that He's a reuse Another fun file name joke is that Becca's file is called "ditzy girl" and Madison's is called "mean girl" Absolutely love the implication that their sprites were accidentally swapped somehow LMAO "Obsolete" They just didn't bother changing Otis's file name is all LMAO Got awkward when the reuse outlasted the original by a million and one sequels Voltra is a true Azura simp I just use Ublock Origin lmao Yeah Adblock's run by sellouts unfortunately Wait, do you think of your characters from your original stories as OCs?? I mean I guess they are but it's weird for me to think of mine as that I know but my mind has been hardwired to associate the term "OC" with bad Mary Sue characters made for fandoms I just think of my characters as my characters. Calling them OCs is silly to me Key words are "to me" I know what the term means, I just can't unsee what I associate it with, which is fandom only characters One time I moderated a roleplaying forum exclusively for OCs and it sure was an experience LMAO Let me guess, they were like this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqgMPTSz91E Yeah we had rules about that on my forum too No making up your own tragic backstory where your entire family was murdered or going on plots where you're the chosen one or whatever That's what they turn into eventually Honestly I could tell SO MANY stories about my forum There was so much fucking drama for a bunch of 14-year-olds and it got hacked twice by members mad they couldn't do what they wanted lmao Nice The first time the forum was hacked the hacker was defeated by an admin literally telling her mother on her because they knew each other IRL Yes Drew out here posting his own baby pics, braver than any US marine lmao TIL that Episode finally released some premium outfits for the users to use lmao They release assets now and then for the outfit catalog for people to use in their stories I dunno when these were released but I remember people requesting these for a long time Would you pay money for these outfits lmao These wouldn't be able to be in TRR, they exist below the thighs Damn, what did the second one do to you LMAO The original art style was definitely way worse about the bodies And for what it's worth they now have a plus-size female body type Their muscular female body sucks though, it's just the regular one with one (1) single ab on the stomach Lmfao No they just added extra shading to make it look "toned" No muscular arms or shoulders or legs  LMAO It's always the same button nose, narrow lips and weirdly contoured jawline with those specific eyes For the girls it's always the long wavy hair, narrow eyes and the thick lips Is this the story I think it is or I vaguely recall there was an Episode story with this premise lmao It was about a girl who disguised herself as a guy to try out for a boy band for fun but ends up actually being recruited to join the band It was actually unironically good but it was a user story and this looks like an official story so my hopes are not high LMFAO Episode always ruins user stories when they buy them and turn them into soulless premium choice husks I don't blame the authors for agreeing to it, I'm sure they get paid big bucks for letting Episode buy them, but there's no quality control whatsoever They don't get any say in what their stories get changed into I only know that because one author actually talked about it and went into depth about the process, I don't remember the details but the basics were that they emailed/reached out to her because her story had hit a certain high number of reads and they paid her after she agreed to let them use it She also low key jabbed at people who got on her case for letting Episode buy her story LMAO Lol There's a lot of crap but there were some good ones if you went really looking The author I'm talking about had a story with a very Wattpad-esque premise but it was genuinely good when it actually went on and in-depth with the characters. Can't say the same for its official version Maybe this is a dumb question and it's been answered before, but can Episode's files not be extracted like Choices'? I don't think I've seen anyone make folders for them like people do for Choices There must've been someone out there who's tried  Please do so Y'all are killing me here lmao Outfit asset dumps from Episode would be a godsend for the user community LMAOOOOOO That's hardly the first time someone's used a Choices background I'm sure Pri, if you manage to extract premium outfit assets from Episode you'll be a hero  Lmao what What was the art? Honestly the way it's drawn is so generic it doesn't even look like Ina lmao You could tell me that was, like, female Asian Hayden and I would believe you I recognize the artist though. He's good, I commissioned him once Not for Choices fanart though lol This one is probably a commission too Yeah, without the lipstick or outfit it doesn't look like Kingsley The person who commissioned that art has an Instagram page and it sure is something lmao He ships his self-insert OC with Zoey and Poppy too And it's like...hashtag okay then Good for him that he's paying for the content he wants to see instead of yelling about genderlocked MCs like certain other fans at least lmao Ouch LMAO Grapefruits are okay but I like oranges more ~~Must resist obligatory joke about why Drew likes bananas~~ Nice Happy Valentine's Day to all you lonely singles out there LMAO Mood Y'all wanna see something cool https://vimeo.com/212631252/ PB paywalling good writing is what usually leads to the worst stuff, weirdly ATV only made sense if you bought all the diamond scenes, people hated it because the conflict was nonsensical if you didn't pay out the nose for everything Similarly Witness's MC was only tolerable if you bought everything, otherwise she was a total asshole to try to force players to pay up and it just had the opposite effect lmao People aren't going to pay just to make something likable/bearable Yeah, exactly. A book should be able to be enjoyed even without premium scenes, which is *why* players will buy scenes The scenes are thus seen as bonuses that are worth paying up for to even further enjoy a book Rather than necessary to enjoy it at all From what I've heard WItness isn't even that much better if you pay for everything, it's slightly more tolerable with a nice MC but it's still bland and repetitive lmao It's hilarious that to this day PB pretends it never happened and has never once addressed whose idea that was Lmao It's a matryoshka doll of paid scenes Every time you open one you get another, slightly smaller one The only time they ever acknowledged Witness again was in the achievement for banging Tatum in FA. Iconic Speaking of FA, how on earth did that become a flop?? It was so weird, it wasn't good enough to be a replayable book but it wasn't bad enough to be Witness tier. It was just a bunch of filler Lol Yeah, that was the most disappointing part I was enjoying it until it turned into a repetitive pattern of "Pay 15 diamonds to get your classmates to stop fighting over something dumb" That's the thing, it just felt like another high school or college book. It had some subjects related to diplomacy and etiquette but otherwise did nothing with its premise of world leaders' kids LMAO Remember when PB posted an ad for WB merch on the same day the last FA chapter came out They really had no faith in the book whatsoever That about sums it up lmao A lot of bones but no meat Ads are really pulling out all the stops these days Remember when LeBron James tried to copyright Taco Tuesday Send me one  If y'all wanna see something funny, look up the Bermuda Triangle and look at the Google reviews lmao Looking at Choices clothing assets again and now I'm wondering, are there any more besides Hana's cheongsam, the kimono from Bloodbound, and Ajay's mom's sari that I missed? I'd like to try to edit one but there's only a few of them I meant those are the only Asian clothing assets I can think of lol I was wondering if there are more that I'm forgetting @Belbercike Yeah that was the kimono Oh right Yeah I mentioned that Annalyse wears a standard strapless gold dress lol Choices has a million Renaissance looking European outfits but only a small handful of Asian ones  What pies do you like  What's the movie My condolences Adam I loved getting the mail as a kid because it meant issues of Highlights Kids Blue used to be the feminine color because it was associated with the Virgin Mary, pink was masculine because it was a shade of red and red equals blood, which equals violence, which equals Manliness It just goes to show how different associations with certain things become as society changes Nice Wordle 274 3/6

 "Suppress" sounds weirdly ominous lmao I know it's the right word but it's kind of weird I've been watching a playthrough of the Originals story Mr. Smilez and man, the romance is...not well-handled lmao Almost EVERY smut scene comes after the characters are traumatized or in mourning for another dead friend and it's like...brah there are better ways to deal with grief ILB handled it better by actually having, I dont know how to word it, events in town? And making it feel like people had a life outside of the lake monsters, so it felt natural to have a break with a LI in the downtime Meanwhile in this story all the murders happen within like, a week, and your MC can make out with a LI right after your best friend's funeral :KEKWhands: So romantic And hi Adam!! I might be quiet sometimes but I'm always here lmao I mean...true But OH wasn't a horror book lmao Every time characters bang at an inappropriate moment in a horror story, I just think back to how characters having sex in a horror movie always leads to them being murdered  And yeah, in a fictional context, it just comes off as bizarre and forced Another reason the romance feels kind of poor is that its very...telling and not showing. There's a lot of emphasis on the characters being childhood friends like in ILITW but unlike ILITW, which had flashbacks, it's just "Hey remember when I walked you home in high school??" Like sir I do not because you're just telling me that now I get Originals had limitations Choices doesnt in the sprites and art department, which was part of why it shut down, but dang LMAO Imagine if that were in a Choices book You pay the diamonds to get down with a LI and the monster drags them out a window right after  Really putting the "fun" in "funeral", am I right :KEK: In seriousness I think the most interesting part about Mr. Smilez is that the villain is basically an otherworldly monster that lives off of fear to get stronger, but he's also an internet character/viral meme a la Slender Man, which makes him worse because people all around the world know who he is Feels like that could've been an interesting plot for a IL3, with a monster that people everywhere, not just in the local area, know about, and it gets more powerful and harder to stop because of that That could also be how MC/Noah, Connor, and Joyce find out about it and help the MC, because obviously they would've heard about it ...man, it's missing IL hours all over again  If only we had more books there and not yet another book in New York LMAO PB writers need to be more adventurous, the United States is a huge country but from Choices books alone you'd think there were only, like, four or five states They should pick a random state no one would think about, like...Idaho. Or Rhode Island No offense to anyone from those states obviously lol Or Kansas ~~so we can go to Oz~~ I'm down Haha geddit because down under https://tenor.com/view/eric-andre-controversial-yet-so-brave-controversial-brave-gif-12046682 PTR definitely could've been an awesome globetrotting book I just want to see a CG of a cow getting sucked up into a Kansas twister That can't happen in New York LMAO In seriousness, variety is good. New York is fine but like...why is it always New York There are other cities is all Oops My apologies to cows That was definitely a great part about PM Going to other countries with an android, a genius, your cousin, and a detective who wants to bang you is  Was Canada in a Choices book I think it was but I don't remember Go to Alaska, hang out with cute sled dogs, get eaten by a bear in the wilderness Perfect book plot https://tenor.com/view/husky-pun-dog-meme-gif-9639526 Wish we could go somewhere else in France for once How about the city literally called "Nice" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice I was also about to make a crass joke about a town in Austria but then I remembered they renamed it LMAO Would've been fitting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugging,_Upper_Austria They fugging had enough and renamed it It's what you type to get past a filter in a kids' video game Weird correlation but aight Mozart? Yeah I remember that book LMAO Did you guys know it got an anime Japan made it a movie before Hollywood did LMAOOOO It does Never got a sequel though  https://www.instagram.com/reel/CV2pMvphDsq/ Now it's raining again :uwuhappy: Bored is an eternal mood Mood Only the real ones remember the days when Webkinz wouldn't let you sign up unless you had a code from a plush Then their membership dropped when Webkinz stopped being the fad and they had to let the Normies join Yeah I tried it again once like...last year for nostalgia There's a regular customer at Taco Bell who always orders from the app and always uses the name Jack Sparrow because he's feeling cute or something Anyone here remember Barbie Girls, Fantage, and Build-A-Bearville? Those were the days So did I, I got the pink and white lion with hearts and named her Hearty Ann lmao It was this one I remember my sister got VIP membership on Barbie Girls when she got one of the MP3 players and it was heaven Too bad it was for one month only I vaguely remember the latter There was also Ty Girls which was just Bratz with plush dolls lmao Barbie used to have a really awesome site too It had all sorts of games and it had a neat set-up where it was designed to look like Barbie's house, and every room you clicked on had different games and activities in it Now it's just a boring clip show gallery  I saved some screencaps from an archive and the nostalgia AAHH Unfortunately these screencaps don't show that they were all animations with Barbie talking lmao RIGHT The fashion design and hair styling games were my jam Yeah, all that too The games based on the movies were my favorites, I played the Magic of Pegasus game over and over because it had the pegasus ride I also miss when kids' movies used to have websites about them Like when CN had parts of the site dedicated to whatever movies they were airing right now They didn't always have games but they had fun features, behind-the-scenes videos, etc. that were cool Yes I remember there was a part of CN that was dedicated to Rodrick Rules and it had fake ads drawn in the original book style, social media-like comments from the characters, stuff like that Now all the kids' movies rely on Twitter and TikTok to advertise but they suck LMAOOOO Everyone was in love with Devon Bostick Exploded diaper all over the place  The #NotMyRodrick thing was only funny for like one second until people started saying gross shit about the new actor That sure was something Remember when conservatives threw a bitchfit about Starbucks not putting Christmas stuff on their cups for the holiday season? Lmao They're obsessed with being the victims at all times Don't bring up Hanukkah around conservatives lmao Conservatives only "care" about Jewish people when whining about how criticizing them is TOTALLY like persecuting them like the Jews in the Holocaust I'm personally indifferent to the idea of having kids, it would depend on my financial situation and if I ever get married If I had any, I think I'd only have one. I don't think I'd be equipped to raise more properly Which OC is it  Wait never mind I looked I mean...same ~~Me with the male characters I make to be my protagonists' boyfriends~~ Bulbasaur is my favorite Evidence: my plush https://tenor.com/view/reactions-gif-23256962 Here's a bonus side profile Eyyyy It's fine, I would've done the same if I had the money LMAO But I'm also happy with just the one thing, I don't buy merch a lot in general but Bulbasaur is an exception :dogeheart:  Why do you like unsalted crackers Please go to quarantine  No need to insult wizards like that :KEK: About as hot as the year of 1816 What's her name  No  LMAOOOO Weird flex but okay I was talking about your roommate Lmao Happy ace day! So, y'all wanna see an article about how a hat designer filed a lawsuit against Fox claiming that a character she invented in 1999 was plagiarized for their animated movie franchise, and this led to a chain of events where Scrat can't show up in Ice Age anymore <https://www.insider.com/ivy-supersonic-legal-battle-ice-age-scrat-2022-3> The original character was called Sqrat LMAO Oh, actually it says at the end he's still getting a spin-off series The lawsuit didn't keep the rat-squirrel down after all Biggest mood Imagine paying 30 diamonds for them at the time only for them to become free later  I wonder if the super OG fans are even still on the app lmao What do they think of the different books, VIP, etc. Or they just deleted the app and moved on like normal people I'm sure the OG fans are unhappy the app turned into Generic Sexy Times App Number 219394 Or maybe they don't care lmao And before anyone says that the OG books had sex scenes and dark themes in them too, I will remind you that they were not advertised as that...just saying :3 LMAO The sex scenes were literally just kissing and then fading to black My, how times have changed But it is what it is Even then Choices always uses the most flowery language for sex scenes possible Something something bliss something something pleasure something something ecstasy Damn, Witness MC is that you LMAO Someone oughta write a bingo card of that To be fair that is not a PB-ism lmao It's a writing cliche in general "Smile that doesn't reach eyes" is up there with, I dunno, "it was a dark and stormy night" Or "let out a breath [x] didn't know [x] was holding" C R E S C E N D O Cars 4 looks great Next book is gonna be about playing in an orchestra obviously It'll be called "Crescendo of Love" What a good boy Today I learned what FOMO means :KEK: Coachella does look fun though Too bad I can't go When was the last time you went? Citation needed That's actually really cool, good on the animators for making their own send-off ...man, now I feel nostalgic for Ice Age LMAO The sequels gradually went to shit but the first movie is a classic, don't @ me Unpopular opinion: he doesn't look that bad I mean, fair I did love the movie as a kid though so I remember every beat of the plot lol It's weird to think about what the sequels turned into when the first one had pretty shockingly dark moments for a kids' movie, like the villain wanting to murder a baby and the flashback of the main character's mate and child having been killed by hunters It definitely should've ended at the third movie lmao But alas, money is the driving impetus Did y'all know that the baby's name was Roshan Can you send me one  Happy Easter  Did you all do your taxes today Sorry Metta I know people not doing taxes pains you What was your job? OH Now I remember, sorry lmao Yeah that mustve been exhausting I also work in a customer service job so I get it That's good. Congrats How about Ruchano Why did I get an email about resetting my Facebook password when I did nothing of the sort and haven't been on Facebook in years Lmao They're doing a piss poor job then My condolences Honestly even if it weren't for all the shit Facebook's pulled I still wouldn't go on it, the site's unrecognizable now Near impossible to navigate Not sure what a hacker would get out of my account either I haven't updated it in almost a decade and I don't speak to anyone on my friends list anymore lmao True Take a picture  F Why'd my boss wink at me when he said I could take my thirty earlier than usual I'm not complaining though Yes It might be because I asked someone if she wanted hot sauce with her Dr. Peppers LMAO Cursed routine Sadly no Elon Musk bought Twitter, time to shut it down and go home everyone My condolences Used to play 6 with my brother What are the other foods though  My heart hurts looking at that Literally. That looks way too fried https://www.tiktok.com/@beccabutcherx/video/7049050647194275077 It sounds like a misguided compliment They seem to think you should show off your figure Abyss is 1000 years old actually https://www.tiktok.com/@chrischris011/video/7090222460695498026 Just found out a coworker I thought quit was fired for a wild reason Apparently her boyfriend attacked an employee and she took his side and kept changing the story about what happened And he also vandalized a truck?? I regret not getting her contact info while I had the chance I want to ask her about it LMAO Too bad I missed it  It's me missing all the fights at high school all over again I think I mentioned once there was a guy in my high school biology class who ran a Twitter account dedicated to shit-talking people at school and it was literally called "[my high school] hate tweets" I'm pretty sure he got suspended because I never saw him again The superintendent made a statement about it in the local news, it was a pretty big deal LMAO https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article42896283.html No It didn't even last more than a week LMAO R.I.P. It was free when I saw it  https://web.archive.org/web/20151221215135/http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article42896283.html Why do I keep getting this ad bro LMAO The fact it's for Evony is even funnier because the game was literally spyware https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/03/evony-investigating-the-game-everyone-loves-to-hate/ I'll never forget those weird-ass shippers who called themselves "Harmonians" and started the most bizarre conspiracy theories as "proof" of their ship like "the hippogriff ride of true love" and "Hermione's (P)atronus is an (o)tter" Very annoying and basically Zutarians in a different form More like the Zootarians, am I right LMAO Y'all remember How I Became Yours??? Comedy gold Funniest part about it was that the artist literally got banned from Deviantart from plagiarism Imagine fucking up so bad that the mods actually got off their asses and did something about you :raifepain: Then again that was like...2008 or 2009 when the site was actually semi-relevant She also made a sequel but nobody cared about that Patron deez nuts Is anyone trying Discord's party mode LMAO The confetti going everywhere every time you type sure is something Happy birthday! Looks like Snape's stuck in a bear trap It's what he deserves That poor son :raifepain: It's even funnier/stupider if you read the actual article LMAO Their argument is literally "We went broke funding your education so you need to either give us money or have a kid" Like...how exactly would having a grandkid solve their financial problems?? If anything, that would make it even harder for them to get money from their son because he would obviously devote more of it to raising his child One time I ran a scooter over the side of my foot and had a scar for a while lmao This was when I was like...seven Chick-Fil-A sucks but the rest sound good .cowsay How would you like being turned into a burger instead? .cowsay Otis from Barnyard is a trans icon! :KEK: .cowsay OK boomer That's the last one, I promise LMAO Sliverenen Looks like the main character in a low budget talking dog movie This is probably a weird question but has anyone here recorded or thought about recording their playthroughs? Because I have a screen recording feature on my phone for the first time and now I'm thinking about it lmao Is it because Aku's your peer LMAO Reminds me of the time I saw a manip of the alien planet background from Hero being used for a random RP forum game Seeing Choices art in places you wouldn't expect is kind of funny Send me a brownie please  Willis Carrier:  Tag yourself I'm the highest leg on the right Really feeling this video today https://www.instagram.com/p/BV-bkLeDol1/ Did anyone else in SoCal receive the "conserve energy" alert on their phone? Scared the living shit out of me bro Ireland and England have a less than pleasant history so anything bad that happens to England is an absolute win for them Northern Ireland is its own complex issue Welcome back Milque  I keep forgetting Metta and I have the same birthday lmao Happy shared birthday Metta  24 for me lol But thank you! Thank you Milque :dogeheart: Thanks!! Happy birthday! @AhmedDarkSlayer Yes Relatable What were you trying to post Ah okay I'm dumb, for a second I thought you made a Twitter for this Discord and I was. Confused lmao Imagine if there was a Twitter account for this Discord and spoilers were posted without context every week Looks more Asian than the BB face at least Still annoyed me lmao And white women can have long black hair with bangs too :smart: Jackie's thing is being competitive but I don't think she can be defined as "unsupportive" in the same way as the others because she's a LI? Xanthe, Ellen, Scarlett, etc. are non-LIs and presented as rivals There's also Michelle from ES because she's unfriendly at first and also interested in a LI (Sean) Oh, I'm not saying they're unrealistic or bad characters. This is just about how PB tends to make women of color act unfriendly or be rivals to the MC to justify their often poor treatment by the narrative Oh, there's also Jocelyn from ILITW because she and Lauren have the exact same face lmao What's wrong with lattes Life on another planet: (exists)
Humanity: I'll be shotgun Someone else can drive It's gonna be a flying DeLorean with a flux capacitor Psychic instincts clearly Eyyy Welcome to the crib Spoilerland: Priya strikes back Tfw my birthday is the same day as Metta's but I don't get the ability to cause chaos  Thank you Pri   I took French in high school and suddenly I've forgotten all of it Witness set a truly new low bar lmao I miss the days when everyone thought HftH was the worst book I'm just gonna wait till it's over to diamond mine it lmao I haven't gotten the update yet thankfully It's so weird that it's causing so many bugs too That formatting pains me What is going on lmao Murder fics?? ???? I'm even more confused Is there any context to this Why are we writing fics about murder That makes even less sense But aight If you wanted to make it spooky you should've just written it in the style of "And Then There Were None" and have an unexpected character turn out to be the murderer Like uhhhh The MC's daughter As a baby she turns out to be the new antichrist and kills everyone Done Clearly Halloween material Stephen King would be proud Lame Anticlimactic and not spooky at all. 0/10, no effort I did tell that to Mara right now @MaralinaSakura Your horror is 0/10 and anticlimactic and not spooky at all Sorry for @ing you ...okay? I'm not saying your writing is bad I suck at writing horror lmao So I'm not one to talk I have to take the second part of a midterm today Thank you!!  I just want a new mystery book lmao Witness is always going to be that weird cousin from prison no one in the family wants to talk about lmao It's so funny, like...the fans won't ask about it because we all want to forget it happened and the writers don't want to talk about why it even exists Like HOW does that happen. Who thought having millions of diamond choices for the dumbest things was a good idea?? Why is the plot 90% bad smut and nothing else?? God if only Unfortunately MW2 will never come back from the war   If Choices books were family members TC&TF and TF would be the grandmas and MW is the granddad who went MIA decades ago and no one knows where he is Hero is the cool cousin who went on adventures but no one's heard of them last and rumors say they died in space Hero is such a bizarre case because apparently book 2 has a finished script, it's just the art that's the problem No word on why PB hasn't been able to get the artist back, or why they can't hire a new one I wouldn't mind if they changed it and used the usual Choices art style in book 2, as long as book 2 existed ES's art was handled by a whole other company Apparently Hero's art was by a person, which is different To continue the family member analogy, It Lives is your veteran badass cousin who believes in cryptids and is crazy prepared for the strangest of emergencies Unfortunately you last heard from them when they were off investigating their newest mystery and you're not sure where they are anymore TRR is your sister who got hitched with a prince and now won't stop spamming her Instagram with pics of their baby I mean, it could always surprise us It being VIP indicates they think it's worth people paying for VIP for But yeah it sounds pretty dull lmao LMAO Only veterans will remember when you had to pay diamonds to hook up Zack with Brandon and Abby with Tyler in book 1 of TF and then in book 2 they can be couples for free And then 293494050 books later Zack and Brandon break up without your input anyway What're you talking about Becca was the weirdest LI Becca is the reason Poppy stans exist Right? Lmao Valid I don't pay diamonds to fight unless I really want to Slammed the choice to fight the terrorists with a sword in TRR book 3 faster than no tomorrow ??? I guess they had to throw a bone to the Poppy stans who won't shut up lmao Watch them make her a LI only at the actual very last second Tfw the antagonist of the book gets more hook-up scenes than one of the LIs Yet more proof that Kingsley was supposed to be the only LI and PB had to cover their ass lmao Hsbdmfgkhm it's worse than TNA because at least TNA made no pretenses that you could romance anyone other than Sam In QB you have Zoey as another option but she was treated as a walking closet for almost half the book Speaking of TNA did the questions ever get answers Weird, they had a Q&A to send in questions to posted a while back What are the odds they'll answer the "Why isn't Robin/Sofia a LI :(((" questions lmao Lmao It's fine if you like them but why beg for them to be LIs in a book you were told was single LI from the literal first chapter It's so bizarre I mean I hope you don't actually expect them to be LIs Lmao God who's gonna be the one answering the questions Who's willing to go to bat for this book with two white half-naked people canoodling on the cover Lmao someone brought that up on the subreddit once Female redheads (like Quinn and Nia) are LIs and male redheads (like Brian) are either jerks/villains or nonexistent There was Skye, who's Brian's sister They already mentioned Kate Congrats to the winners!! ~~Low key wish my Josephine emote made it though ~~ How many stories did Storyscape have? The only ones I heard about were the Titanic and X-Files ones Lmaooo same Path to Fame was fun (the first part, anyway) How'd you find an Episode mod? I heard Episode was impossible to mod for some reason Oh that makes sense Channel's been silent for four days so have a photo of Bruce Lee Same  That's definitely a new glitch lmao Oh never mind then Never forget the time an ad showed the CG of Robin and Sofia canoodling before the chapter even aired  Me, watching Twitter and Tumblr melt down over a ship that finally became sort of canon after literal decades of baiting on a show that's right about to end anyway on the same night that Nevada still hasn't finished counting the ballots and Putin resigned: What a fucking time to be alive LMAO Yeah that's why I said "sort of" lmao I mean, it wouldn't be the first time a Choices sprite was whitewashed lmao There was the sprite used for Isis in ACOR that got turned into a white lady in...Witness?? I don't remember the book For some reason PB has a tendency to conflate Hispanic with south Asian and Middle Eastern The arrows are really pointing to wherever the book might've disappeared off to Happy birthday! Tfw they let Ava wear TRR MC's outfit in-story but not Sonia Asian male Hayden is best Hayden, don't @ me Who told them about the Sofia meme To anyone on the Choices team in this Discord: cancel TNA 2 and make MW 2 instead   Rockin' around the Christmas tree, at the Christmas party hop  MW is the only book with no romance at all and MW 2 is still in development hell so who knows lmao MTFL would definitely be improved a thousandfold if it were a comedy lmao At least then the MC's faux deep narration would make sense and the Principal Jennings drama would be intentionally over the top instead of trying way too hard to be serious  F Yeesh, what's with the weird discolored area on the armpit lmao And Zoey's face does look off, it's like her cheek is slightly bigger Also lmao at the DS one, why do they have to make Edward the evil captain the MC has to "get revenge on" :kek: ACOR and TRM both suffered from the same problem of having too many ideas but not enough time to execute or develop them as well as they should've been, though personally I think ACOR handled it better because it at least had the excuse of needing to follow history to some extent TRM has no such excuse lmao. ACOR works as a standalone even if it was obviously rushed to get to the end, TRM was just...bad. I think it would've been less of a problem if it weren't for PB's weird insistence that every single book takes place in the same universe For all the "ordinary" books to take place in the same setting makes sense, but TC&TF's setting somehow being the predecessor to modern day Cordonia just raises the weirdest questions Like where did the dragons and magic go?? Kenna looking down from heaven at Cordonia's obsession with apples like: And she's wearing BB MC's default outfit lmao Girl is a Frankenstein's monster of reused assets Me watching the NRA file for bankruptcy: It's what they deserve Tfw PB won't reuse THOBM MC faces for MCs but will make a full-body version of THOBM MC's outfit for a side character in a new book to wear They also did it for Britney Tfw a reused Esme gets to wear Britney's full outfit Yeah that's a thing in the older Choices books Characters have weird squiggles or smudged/unfinished spots in the parts of their sprite that aren't supposed to show up in the character box Yeah that's weird Constantine was the most interesting villain because he was presented as the benevolent king and, unlike the other villains, he couldn't easily be disposed of or defeated. Shit was complicated and because of that his assassination made sense Now the villains are just obnoxious caricatures who only exist to make the MC's life hard Was there a link to a drive with the fonts used in character names/text in the text boxes? I could've sworn there was one but I can't find it for some reason Yeah, the font in the dialogue is Sofia Pro (I think? It might have changed) Are we really gonna get into the "Andrew is eeevil and hates redhead women!" argument again lmao I'm not saying Andrew is unproblematic or whatever Just that I'm uncomfortable with the insinuation that he has some personal misogynistic grudge against redhead women Why what True Silas isn't a redhead though? Brian is the only one I can think of off the top of my head Ah yes, the generic white chick who shows up in every book Her hair is cute ngl, wish it were a MC hairstyle Oh damn you're right, I forgot about Brooke for a sec Okay correction: I wish this would be a MC hairstyle, and in black because for some reason black hairstyles are almost always not good  Lmao It's a weird fucking pattern for sure but I'd just like to point out Andrew is a writer, not a character designer. There's no indication the writers have input on what the characters look like or what their hair colors are unless I missed something in an interview Quinn, Nia, etc. would not be different characters if they were blonde or brunette Zak?? How...would he know how it was made Why does her expression look like she's about to sneeze :kek: Tell me she's not about to go "achoo" :dogekek: (No disrespect to the artist of course) Oh boy This all sounds interesting, why'd the story end up falling through?? That sucks, can they release the story in another form? It'd be a shame to let it go to waste because of a crappy company This is just the "they're the same picture" meme Lmaooo Choices is really going to turn into Chapters and divide everything by "sweet, simmering, and billionaire" romance categories any day now, huh :kek: TNA is just the bottom of the barrel fare imported straight from Chapters And that's saying something because Chapters does have enjoyable stories if you know where to look LMFAO Don't give them ideas :kek: It'd be single LI with a gender-locked female MC who's a sub at all times and you can only be a dom for one (1) diamond scene and the LI is customizable between male/female but will be referred to with male pronouns at all times even if female Fair enough Which one is that Oh boy Is it any good Is the LI hot at least It doesn't have the ~sExY~ cover though You know what I mean lmao None of them are in a bra and there's no shirtless man :kek: Have you never seen a romance novel cover Her boobs gotta be POPPING out of her corset In most books you can play without romancing anyone Key word is "most" TRR qualifies as romance because you have to pick a LI, you can't stay single It's not like ES where it takes you not romancing anyone into account by focusing on MC's friendship with Diego instead LMAO It's weird to think the books used to reference each other and act like a shared universe To the point that characters could overlap between books, like Jake's sister being Rebecca from MW Never forget that TC&TF is both actual history and a TV show And MW became a show and an arcade game before ever getting a sequel  ES is somehow a movie too in MTFL Maybe Diego wrote a book about their adventures and dedicated it to MC's memory :Dopeysad: Hartfeld is the center of the universe Which one?  Guess that makes Andrew the last man standing Ms. Match, apparently. Not sure what else though Late but Rafael sure looks oddly...paler on that cover Prayer circle for the Aurora stans  Don't give them ideas That's called false equivalency, lads Never forget that Damien was reused as a frat bro and the black THOBM MC keeps getting reused for side characters  Ethan stans: Omg noooo they can't let Ethan flirt with Harper how dare PB   
Me, a Raf stan who had to see Raf be sidelined and forced to be a couple with a random side character for multiple chapters in book 2: Like it's just so funny to me lmao Ethan gets THE most screen-time and preferential treatment at the other LIs' expense but the moment he *might* be somewhat a little bit interested in another character, they throw up a hissy fit and act like it's the worst thing ever? Hashtag okay then Ethan stans are the clingy jealous girlfriends who interrogate their boyfriends for 4 hours for breathing in the presence of another woman Prayer circle Aurora gets promoted to LI status at least so her stans can finally be happy  That's why I said "prayer circle" What happened to that Marco Linfan spoiler account on Instagram? It seems to be gone Really? I'm getting a "page isn't available" No I've never interacted with her at all though?? It's literally just showing up as "page isn't available" Wait never mind, apparently she added extra spaces to her username :kek: The only interesting thing on this account is the alternate and SFW covers for TNA she uploaded Seeing TNA MC in BB MC's outfit low key has me going though. Girl you do NOT deserve that amazing outfit, that's BB MC's :bartiemad: I know they have the same face but you know what I mean lmao That "snitch" account just seems creepily devoted to harassing the Marco Linfan account It's the only spoiler page they "reported" and it's weird as hell It just seems like an annoying teen with too much time lmao Professional/bachelorette is still the weirdest looking body, honestly Like why are ALL the fingers and the palm exposed like that lmao That too Model body is the second weirdest because of the pose lmao Who juts their chest out with one hand clenched all the time :kek: It just looks like a position that'd hurt to hold after a while Her outfit looks like a typical diamond outfit too All those unneeded ruffles and the sort of sparkly fur jacket Oh it's from art I commissioned lmao Thanks  The artist is Plejaades if you want to look at her art Is it the Picrew one or am I thinking of something different Nice Mine is from this art specifically It was worth every penny  Yeah she posted it on her Instagram too She asks if you're okay with her posting the commission first I paid $35 for it, I think the price is higher if you want it to be full-body and in color? But yeah I recommend her, her art's great Lmao it's the same for the Victor sprite that was recycled for the Marossi king in TC&TF PB has a weird way of naming sprites, sometimes it's accurate and other times it's...not (Also that level-up :kek:) Never forget that Maxwell's file name is "sleazy Middle Eastern guy"  And Hana's is "ambiguous" even though she's stated to be Asian in-story LMAO True In hindsight it looks like a friggin' miracle that PB acqueisced with fan demand and made Maxwell a LI Considering their obsession recently with LIs who are all about the ~sexy alpha male superior~ bullshit and Maxwell is the total opposite of that It's almost like...lots of people like LIs who are just nice and sweet guys :hmm: Who would ever have guessed Really? He looks pretty white to me lmao Like a white dude with maybe a tan at most It could be seen as just crow's feet wrinkles though LMAO Oh yeah that's the reused Xanthe, I think And for some reason Kenna's child portrait has "black" in it even though Kenna's maybe biracial at best (her sprite looks brown but most official art portrays her as white) I guess that's why they reused and recolored it for child Grace in ES?? Smdnfkgmhm Canon Also there's the weirdness of Becca's file being "ditzy" and Madison's file being "mean" Makes you wonder if someone made a mistake and switched their character sprites beforehand :kek: It would explain why Madison's design is more...detailed?? And why she has a cattier default expression (narrowed eyebrows and kind of a smirk), if you look closely True, she has the hand on hip pose too which is more detailed Mean girl sprites tend to have either the hand on hip or crossed arms pose Yeah the early Choices art was definitely in the rough stages There's also the funny inconsistency between Claire Pierce's sprites First one has a crop top, second has it covered for some reason Oh lmao I didn't even notice the slight tan Oh yeah I almost forgot Hayley's outfit is just Claire's colored white LMAO She's a Frankenstein's monster of recycled assets :kek: Wouldn't put it past PB lmao Actually speaking of Alyssa, she also has the "brown sprite labeled as white" problem Like what is she? A white woman with a tan a la Ariana Grande?? Lmaooo yeah you posted that here before I think Sam's hair shouldn't be wasted like this  There's also Angela Hughs having the same hairstyle as Kaitlyn's mom BB MC's default outfit seems to be a default outfit for side characters too, it seems  The wikia is a mess in general All sorts of weird and unneeded "trivia" and comment sections It's in quotation marks because it's not trivia Crap like "this side character's name means [something stolen from a dubiously credible baby name website]" or "this character looks like [insert famous actor here]" It's fine if you want reference for a character portrait/story or help on choices in a playthrough but that's all it's good for lmao You should add that LMAO That's actually trivia How could you list characters with R's in their names and not mention Rafael  It's not strict at all though? They let useless stuff clog up their articles all the time lmao A good editing staff wouldn't let stuff like "this name means [X]" on an article, that's not trivia Ah yes Nepotism Honestly Fandom sucks as a source of wikis and I hate that it's got the monopoly on all fan wikis now The formatting is crap, it allows comment sections, the ads clog up all the space and make articles difficult to read, it's shit And TF Wiki Wikis that actually have effort put into them and run by fans instead of advertising outlets are always superior Transformers lmao It's also a rare example of a wiki that's funny without being tryhard and obnoxious about it Actually Gamepedia has its own problems I think Wasn't it bought out by another site Or am I thinking of the wrong one I could've sworn it was a game related wiki at least I say they can spam FA as much as they want since it's the first MLM cover lmao So at least it's new instead of yet another "woman swooning in main forced male LI's arms" cover LMAOOOOO Unfortunate POC Sounds like me :kek: I am an unfortunate POC you guys Who else in the chat is an unfortunate POC We're all unfortunate POCs (Actually in seriousness I hate the term POC but that's a totally different topic lmao) I hate it because it's the only popular alternative to "nonwhite" even though both terms enforce the stereotype of white being the default And POC lumps people of multiple backgrounds and ethnicities together into one term, which is like...not good A pale-skinned Asian person is never going to face the same kind of racism as a dark-skinned black person even though they're both "POC", that's just a fact Oh yeah that does sound...complicated Admittedly there's been attempts to rectify POC by using BIPOC instead to distinguish black and indigenous people but that just has its own set of problems Mainly because when I first saw it I thought it meant "bisexual POC" LMAO I dunno, I just think it's weird and needlessly confusing Smdfngkhmsndnf WHAT LMAO Of course it was on Tumblr Same Lmao support told me that linking accounts isn't possible...like aight Tfw PB will label a literal alien as "Asian" but label some sprites of actual Asian characters as "ambiguous" or "white" LMAO All otters are adorable even when angry  Personally I wish the prince body would be reused more often And the ILITW male body Just reuse ILITW assets in general  What do you have against the dyed hair The WT ombre hair was gorgeous, wish they'd use it again  That balayage  You're making a tier list for unused designs?? Petition to make this an emote It's writing, so it should Remember when ROD was the Choices app icon and then ROD 2 got canceled lmao Translation: "We're not gonna change it back LOL" FA would've been MLM too The only people who liked TNA were the few people who were actually horny for Sam LMAO Did they? I thought it was WB Oh True But it's still very weird I still don't understand what the deal was with ROD. Did they ever even write a script for ROD 2 or did they just lie to make fans happy before shutting them down?? And was the script for Hero 2 ever real? Did they even have an idea of who killed Hayley Rose? The mind boggles Yeah that's what I think too, but that's what I'm wondering. Did a script ever get written after that announcement or did they just...claim they did when nothing was there @Belbercike Also what do you mean about the music? PFFTTT Lmao Yeah it must be a blow when you make all that new music and art for a book that flops and makes that investment worthless They really screwed people over with the DS ending huh All that collecting just to get one vague historical note about what your LI did without you PB said the same for MW lmao Apparently it didn't do well for them even though people liked it DS could've done better without the time travel thing, shit was just weird and made no sense. If it'd been a straightforward pirate book maybe it would've gotten a sequel LMAO watch COP give you the option to make out with your partner for 20 diamonds in the first chapter What's a slow burn and relationship buildup It'll be MW but horny  Will we at least find out who killed Hayley Rose...please PB it's been 84 years Har har But seriously, it sucks they just left that cliffhanger for years and will never revisit it ILB at least has an open "the adventure continues" type of ending instead of an outright cliffhanger That's the way to handle it, not "Oh no the villain has been found dead!" and then just never go back to it True but considering what happened with TRR, maybe it's for the better that IL didn't get more sequels  You know what I mean lmao Ending a series at its high point is better than dragging a series out beyond its high point and rehashing the plot over and over Like yeah, it sucks that we won't get IL3, but at least it ended on a hopeful note People just like the books they like, it's not really a measuring contest lmao But I guess what aids and abets it is that books with next to no plot get sequels while books with actual cliffhangers got canceled Nobody asked for a BaBu 2, but here it is, meanwhile MW still hasn't got a sequel to resolve its cliffhanger in years Tag yourself, I'm Tyril's flaming sword Raya's dad is definitely a DILF  Clearly this is what should've played when your sexist boss was talking crap and you were about to tell him off More like "Brainzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz" @Metta My condolences Manifesting a Lakers victory next year just for you  Ethan *what* Lmaoooo damn, they really did combine those faces It's BB's eyes and nose with RCD's lips I'm surprised HFTH is ranked on "like" lmao Clearly this means the HSS MC grew up to be the TNA2 nanny, they even have the gender customization in common :kek: Plastic surgery, obviously I'd road trip with Tom, Andy, and Shreya Tom and Andy because they're best bros and would make the trip fun, Shreya because she has magic powers and likely knows all the best vacation spots God can you imagine going on a road trip with Sam, you put a dollar in a vending machine to get chips at a rest stop and that gives you 1000 desire points :kek: Lmao "crisp" PB's run by Yankees, if you wanna parody them you gotta use the American-isms :kek: Mmmm F R I E S PM definitely has one of the best theme songs ~~Like IL 3~~ It's a shame these ads exist because the art otherwise looks good lmao Imagine seeing your art used for this :kek: Not reusing the ILITW female MC's child sprite for this :kek: Is this about the "Satanic cult" ending lmao Which wasn't even in the game itself, it was datamined I wasn't aware 1001 adapted Open Heart too Let me guess, they whitewashed all the LIs except Ethan lmao  I'm guessing MC was made gender-locked And this is what Ethan looks like lmao Why are they front-facing LMAO It's so ominous And the art styles are weirdly inconsistent too, the 1001 version of HSS at least had a cute anime-esque art style All the others just look like wannabe Chapters "L City" The city of taking L's obviously LMAO :hmm: I get that MLF is cringey and annoying but let's not get weird about her personal details lmao Scroll up She's not the sharpest knife in the drawer It seems she wants to have her cake and eat it too She wants fame for being a leaker but also doesn't want to get caught for leaking...even though that means she'd have to be anonymous No How was your day Adam Can you imagine her putting all her weird rambling paragraphs in a story LMAO "Oh, no! John has caught you KISSING  Michael in the window!! What  will you do now?? Will he break up with you??  Find out next time in chapter 5 loves!! " She wants the clout lmao MLF opens a Discord and all the channels have emoji strings in the titles #introduce-yourself-" Lol Quick, Adam, what's your opinion on Marco Lin Fan :youwot: It's Adam alright Actual picture of PB employee seeing MLF's resume and leaking at the same time: White people and not knowing how black people's hair works, name a better duo Figures his Reddit username was Joker, because he really loves acting like a clown I emailed her but she didn't respond What's her Reddit? I'd say it looks like emoticon material for this server but we have too many TNA emoticons lmao We need better material We need emoticons from a different book with weird ads Like...uh They want it to be their next TRR so bad Y'all think those are bad but I think what's worse is PB's obsession with outfits that have necklines all the way down to the navel And there are SO MANY of them it's hard to pick one :kek: Vaanu ending, definitely  Dumb TNA ad: (exists)
Metta: Why do I always get the weirdest YouTube recommendations Teenage me was SHOOK by this cinematic  I always wonder who the artists for the detailed cover/promo art are For...reasons I want to know so I can commission them to draw my OCs  Haha just kidding...unless That's the company that did art for ES, right? Or maybe I'm misremembering the name Oh right, yeah, I remember now I was wondering who the specific artists were, though, and what their names are. Not the company that hired them Bummer that we don't know them  Mal and Jackie I'm okay with this LMAO MLF seems to have no self-awareness so probably not I hope not The Choices subreddit mods are weird as fuck with what they keep and remove lmao They won't delete the endless "DAE Ethan look like David Gandy???" spam but delete harmless memes or mildly thirsty posts David Gandy's just a male model who resembles Ethan, presumably because the artists based him off of him Every month or so there's a "DAE Ethan looks like David Gandy????" post as if that hasn't already been posted 1829348394833857 times Lmao How did this person react to book 3 Did she make a petition begging for a book 4?? I'm going to a friend's house for Thanksgiving I'm supposed to bring pie and Cool Whip lmao Cuddling is better anyway Kind of weird that the FA cover dress is strapless but the actual dress isn't lmao Cover art always has some weird and unneeded differences from the actual book art Like that one TNA art where the MC's dress is pink even though it's blue in the book?? They should make an ad of someone reacting to the opening scene in ILB lmao I used to like Poptarts but now they taste like sugary cardboard to me Yeah, it's either that or the three hand-on-hip poses PB keeps reusing over and over lmao TC&TF was one of the early books so they were allowed to be more flexible with the sprites Now everything is homogenous and reuses the same stuff over and over  At least the dragons always look good It's impossible to mess up dragons I think this is the only female sprite I've seen where the hands are like...both in front Now it's all the MC body poses, or hand on hip, or very occasionally crossed arms It's weird they keep reusing the same three hand on hip poses when they have other similar ones that haven't been reused nearly as much? Xanthe's pose is pretty unique but I don't think they ever used that again Also, ES MC is the only female MC to date with the hand on hip pose LMAO Rarer are the male LIs with hand on hip poses I think Are there any LIs who have the crossed arms pose The only one I can think of is Marc Antony That's literally what happened with the puppy in Sunkissed LMAO It was originally implied it was gonna go to an abusive home if you didn't adopt it and when people got pissed PB had to change it Hex still looks good Okay I was wrong, another hands in front of body pose was the MC's mom in ACOR So that's three Where are his nipples  Okay that's four LMAO I guess that means we'll never see what 1001's version of Azura would look like  The funniest thing about it is that's Vanessa's face on MC's body LMAO The main reason people haven't moved on is because they're still waiting on Blades 2 too lmao That's the thing, PB wants to have their cake and eat it too. I agree some people seem to expect too much out of a phone app game where you have to pay up to get it on with a bunch of pixels, but it's hard for them to not be frustrated when PB pays lip service to the idea of being "progressive" while continually churning out the same smut books. If PB was exclusively making nothing but smut romance books, that's just the direction they're going in. But every now and then they *do* put out a different book like Blades, which shows they could be more diverse if they tried. Also, I really could not disagree harder with the idea that "If you don't like it anymore, move on/stop reading!" People are critical because they *like* Choices. They *want* it to be good. Everyone's idea of "good" is just different. Saying "don't like, don't read" is just an easy way to shut down criticism without engaging with it. If you like smutty romance stories, it goes without saying that's fine. But we've also seen that Choices is capable of taking risks and producing unique and interesting stories. If only making smut is safe and profitable, then why didn't they just do that from the start and spare themselves the higher expectations and thus, the criticism, down the line? Why do Endless Summer, It Lives, Perfect Match, The Elementalists, etc. even exist when they theoretically could've pulled higher numbers by making smut stories in their place? I didn't say that wasn't the case. Obviously at the end of the day, money and executives call the shots over the writers. But Blades is a recent example of a successful, non-smut focused book. If they're just following the money, we should be getting more fantasy stories like it. Like...I understand that the employees have to eat and they have to focus on what sells. But "the executives demanded it/sex sells/smut makes easy money" is not a shield to keep using against critics every single time someone voices disappointment about yet another smut book. That's not really an indicator of quality if most of the released books are smut to begin with. It's like putting out a bunch of cakes with different looking frosting but all with the same amount and flavor of chocolate inside, then saying, "Because the chocolate cake did so well, we're making more chocolate cakes!" If you're going to keep putting out and advertising chocolate, obviously people are gonna buy it. ...that's not a perfect comparison, but I hope my point makes sense? And again, Blades is something people think is one of the best, and evidently it kept the lights on. Maybe it's an anomaly, but it's still there. Are you talking about Witness LMAO Yeah, I dont think they'll do anything like that again Blocked Anyway I got Shreya and Raf, I'm okay with this  I didn't know you loved Maxwell that much LMAO I'm going to let the argument drop after this, but what I want to say that I don't think I made clear is that I don't pretend I know anything about how PB works as a company or what the people who work there do. That was not my point. I assume the best of the writers and I know they're all hardworking people who have earned their positions. What *is* my point is just that I think critics are still fans, and I dislike the "don't like, don't read" argument because *I personally feel* (emphasis mine) it isn't a valid defense. We can agree to disagree. It's one thing to simply not like a genre, that's fine. I agree people should avoid genres they hate on principle. But people can also enjoy things from a genre they normally don't enjoy. People can stop enjoying it when they liked it before. People can enjoy anything on a case by case basis. "Don't like, dont read" is not valid to me because it is all too easily used as a way to shut down criticism before it can even start. It's a way to strawman and it's an easy way to ignore any opinions that don't match your own. So what I'm trying to say is, I do think the writers deserve support and they are generally good at listening to fans and feedback. But I also think critical fans should be taken seriously, their arguments should not just be dismissed as them being "whiny" or "bitter", and I feel that telling them "don't like, don't read" is tantamount to telling them to shut up and go away. By all means, if they're continually unhappy and genuinely don't enjoy Choices at all anymore, then yes, they should move on and find a different app. A lot have done that. But just as many are still around because they still want to see more from Choices. And their opinions are valid. Anyone who still wants to talk about this can DM me so we don't clog up the channel. Thanks. They really had to come out and say "Stop fucking bothering us, Blades is getting a sequel, go away" LMAO Lol LMAO Not gonna lie, I won't mind Princess Swap lmao Reminds me of Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper Of course that's assuming it has the same "princess and commoner swap places when the princess is in danger" premise Jesus Christ lmao The poor mods must've seen a lot of shit to warrant this post :PleasePBJustStop: Honestly that kind of shaming happens already on the subreddit every other week, it must've gotten dire if it needed this level of addressing No doubt part of it is the dudebros being misogynistic in their whining about the genderlocked books :raifepain: Between WB, QB2, and Surrender they must really be throwing shitfits It doesn't lmao They're just entitled LMAOOOOOO If they want a male genderlocked book so bad they can just play visual novels and a million video games They could at least try to keep the mask on and ask for more GOC books lmao It's because girls had to get used to playing a guy because video game creators were mostly male Guys can play as guys all the time and therefore some of them throw tantrums when they're denied their usual status quo  PB wouldn't make male only books because men aren't their target demographic lmao They've always been geared towards straight cis white women first and foremost BASICALLY LMAO Same here I hope they hire more black writers at least GOC LIs tend to be very "safe" and mild because the whole reason for them being GOC is to appeal to as many people as possible lmao Sam is definitely supposed to be male lmao His GOC status feels like an afterthought If it weren't for the whole subplot about Sofia's dad being a super sexist strawman, Sam would be alright as GOC, but the sexism makes female Sam totally nonsensical PB wants to play it safe because they gotta please their new Nexon overlords LMAO Easier for them to stick to the tried and true rather than be bold again ATV's failure was especially bad because all they took away from it was "Our readers hate sci-fi" Rather than "Our readers hate bad books where all the lore is paywalled and the reader has no reason to care about what's going on" You know, I never understood why they don't have that Is it more expensive to host a forum on your site or something? How do they get feedback outside of random surveys? That's a good point. But surely they have to have some kind of test reader group? Movies have focus group screenings for a reason to determine what ends up in the final cut They could definitely use sensitivity consultants lmao Having a few Asian writers and one black writer doesn't cut it for diversity Also, maaaaybe they should also hire a black male writer for that black cast-led book? Black people's experiences aren't all the same and black men and women especially have different experiences I remember people giving them shit for giving a warning for "exploring sexuality" lmao Because it came off as homophobic/biphobic No clue, they haven't actually promised anything TE is also the rare book where you can play as explicitly asexual Never forget Morgan was supposed to be GOC and was made a woman by default at the last second R.I.P. the unused male assets lol I think he was just supposed to be race customizable? The fact that the only black LI was also the only one who can be permanently removed if you make a bad choice was not good :raifepain: True lmao Lusbian The cynic in me wonders if Shane would've been a popular LI if he'd been kept race customizable Okay, correction: slightly more popular I'm only wondering because we literally have proof from 1001 that certain LIs are more popular in it when whitewashed Caleb is one of the least popular HSS LIs, but in 1001 he's white and he's like, second most popular??? It's incredibly unsettling Metta lists all 10 of his top fave LIs and they're all just 9 Liams and 1 Charlie lmao Y'all are gonna break the bot lmao Don't go breaking my bot  Ouch What's wrong with a knobhead Why do the female LIs always have the best hairstyles  How do you pronounce Yvette anyway Why does white Jack have a longer face than the other two It's very distracting .img marco LMAO The forgotten Marco Why are black Marco's lips so red :raifepain: .img travis This your man?? Rare redheaded man on Choices who isn't evil Everyone forgot about RT lmao Asian male Robin at least looks cute Not gonna lie, I found the hate weird and disproportionate People wouldn't shut up about how "annoying" she was and it's like...okay, she's not real, but I hope you all don't also feel this way about real teen activists lmao Lmao true LOL WHAT Don't tell me there were people begging for a baby like Bartie to be killed off :raifepain: That's just weird What Where's the source on that TRR, the extremely fluffy romance where MC partakes in an apple eating contest to win a prince's hand in marriage, as dark and grim GOT?? Does not compute The fans would've rightfully rioted lmao In the game of apples, you win or you eat the stem ILB says hi lmao Even though it's only in the bad ending Hey Metta do you remember that weird Bertrand stan who wouldn't shut up about him What the fuck was that about LMAO Good, they were annoying Imagine stanning friggin' Bertrand of all characters :kek: LMFAO The balding Republican sweater vest look must've really done it for them Isn't Katnerys a mod on the subreddit?? What was it?? I'll be surprised if she doesn't open a new account in three days lmao None of these are even resemblances? They all look different Also whoever made this shouldn't insult Mark Hamill by insinuating he looks like Raife  Mfw I remember I didn't buy anyone in my family Christmas presents MW is kind of funny in the MC fake-out regard because if I remember right, the beta version let the decoy MC live if you chose to run away But in the final version they die no matter what, I'm guessing because it's more dramatic Yeah, I remember that now Why is it always Hispanic Sam LMAO What's with his eyes LMAO Dudebros are so weird lmao I thought they liked it when women chase after them?? Now they don't?? What is the truth Choices isn't obligated to have a male led book in the same way video games geared at men aren't obligated to have a female protagonist lmao They could do it, but they won't because that's not their target demographic Something something Facebook moms something something money Obligation is the best word I can think of to describe it I'm sure there's a better one I guess the better way to describe it is that Choices does not HAVE to make a male led book. That corner of the market is already very much covered A male led book would be interesting if it actually did something with the premise of being genderlocked to male Like, if it were set in the military during a war before modern times Not mainstream video games, but there are visual novels Though those are obviously very varied in quality Then again everybody gives Chapters flack, but it has some male led books LGBT too That's obviously not a fair argument. I didnt say that's the end-all and be-all I didnt say a male led book would be bad. But it just bugs me when I see certain (NOT all) male players haranguing the official PB media accounts for male led books Like, it's valid to want something different. I just don't like the weird sense of entitlement I get from some of them. (And yes, this sense of entitlement is also present with other fans who are not male, and want certain types of books. Fan entitlement is a universal thing, Choices is not special in that regard) Hot take: Benedict Cumberbatch with a beard is hotter than Ethan Ramsey (Who is basically David Gandy anyway lmao) I'm right and you know it :kek: LMAO Drew out here ready to go to horny jail Metta out here giving us a million emotes Do it Metta Make the emotes Therapist: Front-facing Sam isn't real, he can't hurt you
Front-facing Sam:  Lmao same hat If she simps over Tom too I might have to look into whether or not I have a secret identity to confess to :judgeyfroge: I'm kin with her existential crisis expression Yeah I think you're right, sadly She's very fucking weird I mean, it's poor wording at the very least Also "I don't care if you're a trans"...as if being trans is a flaw lmao That's fair I don't think she means harm by this, but it just comes off as bizarre at best Basically, yeah Tag yourself, I'm the weird reflection in Sofia's burning eyeball LMAO Sorry Metta Credit goes to the meme making king obviously Of course that's what levels me up :kek: I'm 6 when that boba tea hits just right They tend to look like they just painted over photos of hands and it's weird Reminds me too much of all those bizarre edits with Choices sprite faces edited onto real people's bodies  Even worse :raifepain: Uncanny valley like whoa, bro PB sometimes gets into it too Mostly with the way the artists insist on coloring in every single individual tooth when a character smiles Is this the first time we've heard of The Cursed Heart?? I'm guessing it's fantasy Oh, I must've forgotten The Cursed Heart is obviously Open Heart's prequel/sequel/spin-off/whatever LMAO Clearly Ethan became self-aware of the fourth wall and cursed the whole series from book 1 onwards to revolve around him a la Monika from Doki Doki Literature Club Switching lives with Bryce Lahela Guess I'm a surgeon now and he works at Taco Bell :kek: I'll switch with you Pri I'd overcome public speaking anxiety for Tyril Spring wedding > all other season weddings Nice and warm without being too hot and flowers everywhere It's because they always gotta reuse the same summer backgrounds LMAO TRR was summer too, wasn't it Bloodbound. Depends on whether or not I get a hot vampire to turn me before I get eaten LMAO Only in Choices ads do characters have legs and wear shoes LMAO Mfw there's one piece of cake left Craig from ES and Bryce from OH Similar chaotic energy Also, Azura from TC&TF and Aerin from BOLAS. Evil royalty whose names start with "A" lmao To be fair teeth always kind of looks weird in Choices It tends to be weirdly detailed PB seriously gave a pity gift just to make the VIPs stop whining lmao "Here's your diamonds, now stop trying to track down our locations" Not to knock the Choices artists for borrowing real life inspiration for their backgrounds, but for all its faults Episode usually has pretty good original backgrounds lol Especially the really detailed ones Lmao It's only the gold and the rounded roofs I guess it's also the pool/fountain in front, but those look completely different so First one is in a fictional West African country, the last one is in India I know, right  Have some more royal backgrounds LMAO Bonus: bedrooms It's the curtains and random paintings lol Got my blue elf boy  What ad is that from They do look weirdly similar LMAO Same nose and facial structure Also hairstyle and facial hair What is this person even hoping to accomplish?? Do they want PB to come down on them for leaking? Do they not realize those covers are leaked and they shouldn't be @ing PB with them???  I impulse buy takeout Removed from the list Marc Antony was from Rome, which is in Italy, so he was likely white. That said, ancient societies had a totally different idea of race from today and Rome and Egypt were both extremely diverse Nice PFP change Drew Appa is always good  I'd leave Not sure what Carter and I would talk about since I know nothing about sports LMAO What if we kissed  in the hog wrestling mud pit  Never mind said it was lol Whitiewashing in fanart is always gonna be a thing lmao This tweet sums it up https://twitter.com/alphacatgworl/status/1497859563185344516 All the Choices LIs have steely buns Late to the conversation but unfortunately "abusive" has become a catch-all term for Gen Z kids to use to describe any fictional character they hate lmao Same goes for "gaslighting" and "pedo" You cant say that and not say what it is  Daniel the waiter on his way to reveal himself as the ultimate Choices villain obviously Look at that nefarious smirk of his Yeah, I was wondering how they would handle that if they ever implemented a user stories feature This looks interesting and all, but I wonder how it'll work. Will popular user stories be turned into books on the Choices app or will the apps stay completely separate?? The "no coding" thing makes me wonder too It looks like the user stories app will have a completely different art style, which I'm sure will disappoint people lmao Why is her bun coming off of her neck LMAOOO The only appropriate reply to that is "Ma'am this is a Wendy's" Like...who cares lmao The IL covers are definitely the most unique for not having main characters on them Unless you count the vague silhouette on the boat on ILB Eariler LMAO What's tragic is that the bob is the only black hairstyle for female MCs that isn't afro-textured I think it would've looked better if it weren't so small That meme you skipped over did have a point though lmao Like why is it that PB can make whole new assets just for relatives' faces to match the MC but can't be bothered to make more new MC faces??? Or at least reuse MC faces they used once and never brought out again I'd be fine with Asian ILB MC if she actually looked Asian lmao Tired of PB making faces that are basically white and slapping the Asian moniker on them because their eyes are slightly more almond-shaped  Edna's hair definitely looks better Once I saw an edit of it that made it look better but I can't find it for the life of me I'm sorry but why does the bar on that last thumbnail make it look like Sam is a fighting game character LMAO Blow a kiss at him to make him faint and reduce his life bar ~~Gives a whole new meaning to "finish him"~~ Be sure to report back lmao Damn, where are those sprites  ~~Wow, someone actually romanced Justin lol~~ I don't think I ever dumped a LI unless switching LIs in replays counts If that counts I guess I dumped Adrian for Jax in BB I liked all of them until the repetitive drama made them stale lmao TFS definitely is a series that should have ended at book 2 or 3, after that it got very dull and repetitive. Not MTFL levels of dumb but it became old really fast They gotta cling to the waist to show how SLIM they are obviously Poor Dan He's just trying to help a guy having a breakdown  I'll never forget the weird-ass discourse that started over this man on Tumblr because someone said they wanted to bang him and someone else somehow construed that as wanting him to be a LI and accused them of supporting "pedophilia" 2010s Tumblr was hell bro If there was ever proof that the word "pedophilia" should be used only by professional adults with psychology degrees, Tumblr is it LMAO People whose blogs are just post after post tagged "anti [something]" are always the worst And everyone else on Tumblr is thankful for that It's amazing how Tumblr went through the whole cycle and back of "cool site all my friends are on" to "dumb site with dumb kids" to "horrible awful hell site with horrible awful people" to "cool site all my friends are on" All the dumb Discoursers swarmed away to Twitter and TikTok instead, nature is healing  I'm glad they put their faces on it so we know they're dumb children from the start What's wrong with the butt chin That anime lingo gives me psychic damage Understandable mistake ~~because all romantic poses and Choices men look the same~~ Cover Beckett definitely has bigger eyes than book Beckett lmao His cheekbones and jawline are more square too Emma is cute As long as she doesn't try to set up my dad with her mom again I'm cool with her lmao
