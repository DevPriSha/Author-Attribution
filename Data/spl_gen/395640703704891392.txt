Bachelorette

Baby shower

gender reveal just no back in the day, gender reveals were done with harmless cake and balloons which is fine ig since no one gets killed that way but some moron came up with a brilliant idea to use pyrotechnics near dry ass grass during drought conditions in extreme temps just to reveal the color blue "yay we're having a boy, hope y'all dont mind that we're setting fire to your lives and your property" apparently for some parents, "gO bIg oR gO hOmE" some people should not be allowed to breed honestly i live albeit far away from the fires but i can still see the giant plume of smoke from where i am human error resulting in preventable disasters pisses me off so much. like how could y'all be THAT stupid? and you STILL wanna bring children into the world? anti vaxxers are the worse kind of parents they're the descendants of Holocaust deniers conspiracy theorists will just cry "fake news" or "its all staged" unfortunately we cant fix stupid the Bobcat fire is just a result of fire season yeah all bc they wanna be so extra and feel "special" god, dont even get me started on anti vaxxers those poor children being exposed and becoming carriers :Duffyevil: Dunno her name Jajajajajajajajajajaja Don’t give them any ideas Mason is literally cancelled at this point after the past few chapters of his tomfoolery and I’m here for it 👀 Yeah I think I know who as well :kek: Wait how does one get access to the CAD channel? Or am I blind? Ah Gotcha The friggin sky outside is still red, orange, with a hint of gray But overall, just doing dandy yay, we're all gonna be diagnosed with asthma by the time this year is over! If Californians needed more reason to stay home and indoors, this would be it. Not only is covid still running rampant, but the hazardous air outside is nearly unbearable Just don’t forget your mask and to social distance 😷 Next to not forgetting your phone, wallet, and keys And of course as always, drink plenty of water This heat is a bitch Not as much right now but it has been Ya T shirt and shorts for me It is strangely cool but I wanna dress cool anyway toaster just yeeted the toast #because #mayhaps apparently it surpassed everyone's expectations. didnt even think it was that popular he's just trynna announce today's specials, leave him alone Delish!

Idk I felt like it played not too big a role And honestly it wasn’t my cup of tea Hopefully new ones But with PB, you never know I would love that very much ~~inb4 they portray homophobic male politicians getting caught with another male in the restrooms and those are the scandals~~ :MunchlaxMunch: ~~how can something so wrong feel so right~~ :smart: Yeah but honestly it’s hilarious seeing them all disgraced and shunned once their hypocrisy is exposed. I enjoyed reading those news articles the past few years Yes. What about it? ~~For once~~ Justin had that “enemy to lover” trope Some people like that from time to time apparently i mean it does feature a ranking system, but like many QB fans would say, its a trashy book and thats the whole point. shouldnt be taken seriously Stop making me drool smh Grrr Ooo tbh some of those edits always made me cringe God I love that icon. Instagram looked so much better like that than it does now I miss it And when cishet males aren’t being silent in the fandom, they’re busy fetishizing lesbianism I couldnt count how many times I’ve seen hetero men begging and pleading for more female LIs and then in detail, say what they want to do to them since they’re talking about female genderlocked books most of the time 🤧 not really and imho, spray bottles are *much* preferable than ||shock collars and straight up physical abuse|| when it comes to punishing pets water aint a big deal i see https://tenor.com/view/hunger-games-effie-love-it-i-justlove-that-gif-5608884 ew :kek: :MunchlaxMunch: lmao i love that Pri has been stealing Mara's emotes lately and sending them as screenshots thats the cheap broke lifestyle i live for i myself crop them in my phone's camera roll XD ooo Ahh DAMMIT Ahh i feel so much better now Yay double threat triple :Dopeyhappy: XD 👍🏼 ye hehe nah its a Drew thing naw :dogewink: good 😤 ✊🏼 @itsmeansh Andrew really be playing with my feelings ;-; @itsmeansh the tweet you posted earlier i miss SHS and COD COD was top tier mystery :Dopeysad: lmfao finally i was so annoyed at the inaccuracy and lies :kek: now if only the USA did the same thing God major throwback 😭 Doubtful. I think EA fully owns the rights to those old app games It’d prolly be a legal headache to distribute rights and all that jazz. Idk capitalism so it’s just an educated guess https://tenor.com/view/gravity-falls-emergency-hug-hug-hugging-cuddle-gif-3984945 @Mara goes to show where their priorities lie hey never feel ashamed about being dramatic BaBu2's incoming arrival is the number one problem society is facing today we must come together and combat the situation better yet, a cancellation. *tho its just my wishful thinking* dont remind me :killme: mine is fine currently mining ROE 👀 is there any hint that its the book's finale? or are they going for 18, possibly more? oof Wrong It’s more like this :PBSeeIToldYouSo: I like how you kept both phones just to take this picture Valid But wow, the new in-app design for Choices tho @Deleted User got that right bish 😂 :dogeheart: TC&TF god tier HBD!?!?!?!?!?

Ig it depends on the restaurant and the menu items In my experience, my family and I order the exact same thing so I pretty much have it memorized for when I have to talk to the person and give them my order I always preferred the Monday/Wednesday/Friday system tbh. Seemed more organized and easier to keep up with Now that was wack BP was the very first Thursday, D&D was the very first Sunday, TJ was the very first Monday iirc Everyone hates Mondays after all ~~Why do think Wetness was a Monday release~~ Yeah :Facepalm: Don’t forget the diamond choices *within* diamond choices I’ll tell you what went wrong, PB tried to copy and paste mainstream VNs over from other apps like Moments Generic smutty romance with a ditzy MC and forbidden LI route You mean “shouldn’t” thank god almighty https://tenor.com/view/please-dont-do-that-beg-no-stop-gif-14768042 :ohgodohduck: i feel bad for the actual Cassians irl yes MC's grandmother and Violet's daughter @unforgivablespelling yes bc Andy is a nickname for Andrew ive yet to see any Drew's tho :hmm: unless i forgot there it is :flushedfisheye: :kek: Environmental awareness is finger-lickin’ good :pleb: Nah, get In-N-Out In-N-Out burgers: *chef’s kiss* But what a coincidence lol In-N-Out is so good, highly recommend finding one if you’re ever in California The one nearest me is 5 minutes away I stan everything In-N-Out has to offer Fr His dad jokes give me life looks like Simlish to me :hmm: :hmm: :hmm: Yay Same :ohgodohduck: Starboard hasnt worked since November 9 :sadbear: my god tier meme was the last one to be starred :dogekek: 🤯 :pikawow: Crisis averted lol an interrogation room? the fuck... what is it, a Cops and Robbers Roblox Roleplay? what are the staff even like over there? they sound like they love having power way too much a channel for "interrogating" fucken hell.... :kek: they're cop wannabes or just flexing admin powers or whatever Promise? :aww: :kek: Brave soldier girl, comes marching home :Dopeysad: Oh god no skksjdljdhdgshsjs We haven’t had genuine good crossovers since TH:M with the ROD crew, Alana from PM, and Chaz from ROE were shown, from the crew that I chose anyway Fabien’s good ending @Metta Ye Cali Cool Kids :glasses: 9k4, yes that was him He’s a huge ES stan And who can blame them? ES was *chef’s kiss* ES was def part of the era of the *good* Choices Basically anything 2018 and before was the good Choices Sean my gentle giant :dogeheart: Back when choices and decision-making actually mattered lol Had an impact and everything ES’s CGs were so good That’s worthy of the PB art budget, hands down Now if only they brought back Hero People hated ES’s art style because it want the mainstream art like from ROE and TF Believe me, everyone is entitled to an opinion but what logical reason could you have for hating the ES art style? Because it wasn’t the mainstream style like with ROE and TF at the time they were releasing? It’s just dumb People are just too stubborn and stuck in their ways to fully appreciate the ES and Hero art style another soundtrack you twerk to :kek: you are the gift that just keeps on giving sdjkladjklldjsjksajklssda *swoon* We support and appreciate all that you do :dogeheart: I actually felt that and I don’t even have a job, im just raised in an Asian family That’s nice! Yeah iirc they went off to other jobs in other places Same with the It Lives team Some fans speculated the writers left willingly after noticing the decline in overall content, kind of like “jumping off the ship before it sinks” But idk It’s not far fetched? Likely Like they wanted to be unlike the mainstream VN apps but then they fell into the trend anyway Prolly like a big ol U-turn and then headed out And Nexon is a big factor to play in People saw what Nexon was trying to do and got out before it was too late? Who knows anymore :/ I’ll be the one homosexualizing everything 😈 Actually on second thought, maybe I’ll just cheer y’all on from the sidelines Gotta get work experience before even thinking about it :dead: Community college Same I’m actually studying to become a veterinarian I’ll actually feature them more often instead of forgetting about them lmao But ye, I can definitely work with the doggo sprites Despite only having one Pomeranian my entire life Oh god pls improve OH For the love of all that is accurate and legit Agreed Especially during these troubled times It’s mostly been Grey’s Anatomy drama type of writing :huh: :OOF: the more you know Her older content was so good Especially A Year Without Rain and Round & Round Omg and you can’t forget Magic, the song used in Wizards of Waverley Place: The Movie I highkey miss Selena Gomez in her acting days Totally Spies :dogeheart: And the OG Powerpuff Girls :Dopeyhappy: I’m prolly Jerry lol :kek: pandemic basically makes time meaningless Halloween still felt like yesterday and the week before was spring do it https://tenor.com/view/sassy-tyra-banks-yas-gurl-snap-gif-4968916 F https://uquiz.com/quiz/CpJgGo/which-choices-mc-are-you?p=720478 This one’s mine FYI, I’m NOT nosy y’all 😅 But damn, pretty spot on tho :Bbay: Except the beginning part The rest is right Reeeeeeee We’re essentially hopeless romantic loners who prefer peace and tranquility and self-care lol Hmm not bad 👌🏼 disaster gays exist too you know :eyez: lol you're living your accomplished life still wanted to reply to you anyway lmao ye part of the update be more observant 😤 jkjk *pats Lu on the head* ily and I'm.....just there :pleb: https://tenor.com/view/star-trek-logical-agree-yes-nod-gif-4968296 a silver fox grandpa? :hmm: :kek: inb4 he comes in here shouting "get off my channel" instead of "get off my lawn" :oof: roast war :hyper_eyes: get this bread 🍞 AHHH HES TYPING :okboomer: tru 😂 yes to all of these :dogeheart: Ngl im good with this new interface Whatever book you’re currently reading now takes up most of the Featured page 👌🏼 oh god pls tell me that means they finally got around to fixing the missing Nerve score/relationship status icon 🙏🏼 has anyone actually checked yet? dagnabbit icons are still missing :killme: Well on the bright side, at least TRR1 isn’t the default featured book when you first open the app Got sick and tired of having to see it Nah I just restarted it again i like how you're just writing an essay on all the changes on every single book cover *Bel patrolling the app* oh and the best part is, and this is nitpicky, but those annoying "New" labels are finally gone they were bothering me so much like i already read the latest chapter, stop saying "New" in the corner no those "New" labels only appeared after a new chapter had JUST released until they got stuck like that but they couldnt find the time to fix the missing Nerve score/relationship status icons smh im still miffed about that but he's Hispanic :WTFthonk: hmm they appear brown on my end oof LMFAO spoke too soon :kek: its not even in my Favorites tf its not, i can assure you i dont like the series with a passion well his surname is Reyes, but pls correct me if im assuming 💀 alright back up for a sec, so Latinos CAN have blue eyes...... my dumb ass thought only Caucasians can possess blue eyes JUST CRUXIFY ME I DESERVE IT OK OK IM SORRY :screaming049j: lol there were like two different topics going on and neither were being responded to smfh, now all PB needs to do is grow a pair and make a public statement about MW's fate instead of leaving its fans in MORE longer suspense like i can *TRY* to deal with the fact that its not gonna become a full fledged series but if PB can step up and actually admit to their motives, at least its one less thought in everyone's heads, whether a bad or good outcome we need closure period Yes, we were discussing it earlier Everything got revamped-ish :jebus: Anyway yeah, some colors got darker/lighter. Some fonts were changed. Etc etc No more Frank and his man lingerie :kek: that is...sad imho a shame PB doesnt even try to get their *new* readers to try out different genres anymore other than the mainstream romance fluff/smut agreed 1000% TE: WP the only "Book 3" of TE we'll ever get :Dopeysad: they're still holding back on those lmao ive played Moments and they definitely do not hold back on the steamy raunchy M|M smut Noice Sims good :Dopeycat: :Dopeysurprised: :Dopeyhappy: and then there's me not caring for sports at all :kek: breaking gender barriers by being one of the few male cheerleaders left in the world :pleb: oh believe me, im well aware of the history i find it ironic how today, men are being "feminized" for taking part in cheerleading when right before men were drafted were WWII, they were the cheerleaders like y'all need to crack open a history book or open up Wikipedia cheerleaders were male dominated, get educated :smug: god how times have changed "powdering one's nose in the ladies' room" the stereotypical football jock bully cliche :OOF: college was definitely more tolerable, i had my friend group back in high school to keep me mentally stable but all in all, community college had chillin people my high school was located in a typical middle-class small conservative town where all we cared about were sports while the extracurriculars were neglected. oh and minorities were bullied and staff did nothing to combat it. so all in all, i hated it there my school had a weed scare where during the summer school session, my classroom reeked of weed so they had a cop come down to check all our backpacks to find the culprit my area followed this huge Twitter account called "SoCal Confessions" where all the schools would post an anonymous confession along with their school name. it was usually almost always a sexual experience some kids at my high school managed to bypass a firewall and was able to watch ||porn|| on their devices in the middle of class i'll just delete it since its easier lmao same. once my former classmates graduated high school, it was pregnancies and weddings galore. it was trippy indeed, seeing people i grew up with wanting to be adulting right off the bat yeah it seems very overwhelming like idk how y'all could do that, what with the 21st century struggles we go through on the daily im almost certain a girl my age already bought a whole ass house valid, especially here in Cali you pretty much take a deep breath and that'll cost you $100 i wanted to be a doctor because Asian parent stereotypes, my working class parents suggesting that for me constantly. then i got my first dog and i switched right to veterinarian shhhhhhhh you didnt see anything :eyez: not the ILITW MC :kek: Yes Hartfeld, attends a class with Kaitlyn https://tenor.com/view/pepe-why-pepe-pepehands-crying-gif-12683546 wasnt this featured in PTR first?

If you’re dyslexic, why are you on Choices You’re not the only one Anyway I personally find the wikis walkthroughs reliable because I don’t trust myself. I’d rather get something right the first time than use my one key left to restart just to prevent getting a character upset :kek: Me playing video games that involve making choices, I hate upsetting a character Just play The Heist: Monaco...ish There’s at least one vehicle explosion XD THM is god tier :kek: Car crash trope, what has Choices come to 🤦🏻‍♂️ I guess PB still wants it to remain the fact that the MC will always be on the left side while others are shown in the right side of the screen Exactly, it could’ve used a well-balanced ratio Olivia would make a better queen, hands down Lmao right? :kek: You mean every politician in existence? :kek: Oh no you unleashed the kraken!!! Quick man the harpoons! :niapanic: :bartiemad: GODDAMIT FUCK IM SORRY XD uwu Perfection :CharmanderHi: :marafrogemoji: :MunchlaxMunch: The server babies could walk in any minute now True Good That man needs serious help Literally in all different fields of psychology @Priyudi AHHHHH WELCOME BACK!!!!!!!!

Starboard is alive! once more! we winning tonight kiddos @Arzaylea star my message or perish grrrrrrrrrr gracias :uwuhappy: ooh that starred into both channels are we gonna have to get rid of one or keep both for the sake of flexing? XD phat mood im not even in the book club in this server LMAO :dogewink: :bartiemad: nah never found the motivation for whatever reason nvm xD I’m not okay with this :animeglasses: Yo I would love an LGBTQ+ culture story as a whole ass book, not just a daily release short story. PB needs to grow a pair and portray drag queens and trans MCs already, not to mention non binary rep done correctly :Dopeysad: I just lowkey wanna see PB finally make their message clear that the conservative cishet crowd and their ideals on what a good book actually is becomes rejected. No having to get married, no having to have babies, no female genderlocked MCs, just plain progressive and liberal books. Explore the more tough topics today’s youth faces, social wise Hell to the fucking yes I want my own Pomeranian in Choices Hence the blank slate MCs as of late imagine using light mode couldnt be me anyone who uses light mode is sus i cant stand wearing professional attire, period lmao it makes me feel suffocated and "sophsticated" ugh hoodies for me :Dopeyhappy: Imagine simping for a toxic person Couldn’t be me If the character is “attractive” enough, they can get away with anything Mal is just as popular as Tyril :dogeheart: I wouldn’t be surprised if the fandom bullied PB enough to make Poppy into a LI in Book 2. With characters like Maxwell, anything’s possible Therefore Poppy is still not a canon LI as of now C: People just need to get off their high horse Actually she’s half Caucasian, half Asian Isn’t her father white tho? :OOF: I mean her face clearly says Asian, bottom line Facts Nah it just means you have a lot of time on your hands and you’re using it wisely :dogewink: Same hat Lu Can’t even multitask on Choices :dogekek: Fr 😩😔 We’re never gonna spend money on keys if that’s what y’all capitalist yahoos are trying to make us do :kek: Like Lu said, bless your brain Oh god definitely VOS is my guilty pleasure RIP MW :Dopeysad: No but it might as well be 😔 Can PB just stop being cowards and just say MW is a stand-alone? Like seriously, this is just cruel and unusual torture I’ll pick you up. PB studios is in the same state as me Man if I had the tech skills :kek: That is so fucking true LMAO Gotta love how PB and FB moms are so hell bent on calling me the bully because I dared to criticize TRH but completely ignore the fact that homophobes have been attacking Ava for weeks before, not to mention showing disgust over they/them pronouns I’m actually terrified how they’d react if their kids irl brought home a same sex partner I made enemies within the Choices Facebook fandom lmao Me @ about half the TRH diehard stans I have not bashed the stans either so idk what’s the problem with those lunatics I do not, sorry It’s the hypocrisy for me Exactly Like me disliking TRH ain’t even the worse thing. There are homophobes and transphobes still running amuck and PB won’t do anything about it. Y’all thanks for the love and laughs 😂❤️ Great minds :smart: They really fucked up Ahmed’s character Definitely one of the reasons PB had to make that announcement a while back about banning any Choices player that continues leaking spoilers on a public domain Suspend their account somehow if connected to Facebook or sum Like honestly at least be more discreet about it. That’s why we have Spoilerland Like bitch, just don’t post them in the first place. You can’t control internet users and anything that’s out there on the World Wide Web ***WILL*** be shared, whether you like it or not Blocking is always the good option “Waaah guys stop sharing my stuff without asking me!”
*continues posting on a very public IG account* Make it make sense Oversensitive more like that literally borders on plagiarism Nah not dumb. I didn’t predict it either and I actually preferred it that way. I like being surprised The emotional impact is way more eventful when the goosebumps settle in when you get that “I did not see that coming” feeling But that’s just me It’s literally FA, BaBu2 and Spanish Google Translate TRR Yo Jonathan scared the shit out of me the very first time I read that book I say syllabi :marafrogemoji: lol everyone’s been loving my custom status so much lately 😂 I’ve been getting DMs and such. I’m so flattered :uwuhappy: :zoeywink: Furthermore Woke up to it this morning :BooParty: :BooParty: :BooParty: Pretty much It also depends if you *want* to take a steamy scene since that’s what a 30 diamond choice usually is: a steamy scene Autocorrect....just doesn’t like any of us The nymph forest is a pretty bg aight fine oh its not just Tumblr thats reacting. all the fandoms across the board are sparking with outrage i was on Facebook and the comments are a mix of PB simps, praising them for all their hard work and the people with the valid complaints. like 7 books cancelled, just like that right? that was actually surprising to me ROD stans were unfairly dragged and given false hopes like the rest of us yeah exactly :Dopeysad: idk, some people speculate they have a system in which how many diamond choices were purchased determines how successful a book is, not the keys spent on chapters it makes sense to me anyway we also speculated that that mightve been a lie that there was never a script plus the unique art style 🥺 so many people dislike the alternative art and would rather have the mainstream generic art that had existed since the OG books. like y'all are entitled to your opinions, but come on, give the art style a chance once you get passed it, its really not that bad i mean kinda but not as scary as Tyler's it looks so unnatural and weirdly drawn BRUH LMFAOOOO RIGHT???? lmao yes at this point i wouldnt mind spoilers since they wont come to me in the form of a book 😔 fr PB should just hire interns. so many fans with actually good ideas just remove the "The End...?" from ILB as well https://careers.jobscore.com/careers/pixelberrystudios/jobs/2d-artist-cFgZPYv1qr64S0aKjuTcQg?ref=rss&sid=68 just one of many examples they're so damn picky oh wrong link lmao but you get the general idea clownery shit ok but Shrapnel can rock my world 😩 :kek: i love you @UB3R-B0T 😦 Eva who? i say Eeva We were the first to lockdown after all A *lot* of stupidity :zoeywink: Same here Kio Like for the people that are announcing their departures from the Choices app like this was some airport, for this case scenario, I don’t blame them AT ALL. Their frustrations and anger are totally valid. But with books like BOLAS, the zombie book, and mystery book, etc, I have to admit I’m intrigued. Challenges may have rolled out just to soften the blow from that bombshell but im doing pretty good in terms of diamond earning so I can maybe just maybe replaying the old books and get the full experience. I’m just that type of person ayo welcome back! 👀 :dogeheart: sad :smart: Hilarious, crazy, spontaneous Lmao he said to use adjectives Likes cats @Arzaylea ahhhh someone else who knows Corpse Husband 😂❤️ .ud clout Lol nah It’s a young American term, designed to make anyone famous without having to get some actual talent :kek: I too am a sucker for hoodies Not for cosplay but for something to hide behind while I’m out in public (yes my mindset declares that clothing is used to hide my shy ass self from the world) 👀 Damn you really did find an image that captures my 24/7 mood 😂 Hoodie buddies :dogeheart: Oh shit lmao Ayo phatter mood 🙃🙃 yeah same, i remember that he, alongside the rest of us, would roast the guy for writing cringy self-insert fanfic which was flawed at times but i do remember some of it being hella problematic in the very beginning totally he's been long gone from the server so everything's Gucci Writing channel was always clogged up with “pls read” “tell me your thoughts” “hello anyone?” The kind where an underage child sprite was aged up so that adult things can happen to her like ||having sex|| ||It was Skye from HSS:CA btw|| Exactly. The staff had given him too many warnings and strikes and ultimately booted him I think so yeah. Don’t remember the details but I slightly remember a last straw Mhm Mara and I used to bitch about him in our DMs :kek: Mara is our shoulder to vent on LMAO Yo actually same now that I remember. I offer one piece of constructive criticism and he took it as a green light that I gave him permission to give me constant updates 🥴 like bro no. BASICALLY Oh yeah as Pri said, that was the final straw that got him banned Hopefully Yo Pri, I don’t remember if you were this observant, but remember how he expressed this hatred for BaBu so much to the point where he would repeat the same ass phrase over and over again? “I wouldn’t be surprised if my phone grew devil horns and hellfire on the screen” kept on emphasizing that it’s the Devil’s work :kek: Like dude I don’t like BaBu either but I don’t become overly dramatic and say my phone was possessed by some demonic entity LMAO 👀 :marafrogemoji: a vow of silence jksl;dkahfda they *would* have a poppy server :marafrogemoji: and this is why we consider Poppy to be problematic. characters like her, will develop actual cult followings and yeah, its that serious because she's a pretty female and that's a free pass to be a toxic hateful shrew it would seem tfw people would bash on Benji for his obsessions with MC but then they BECOME a Benji for their obsessions with Poppy the irony :ohgodohduck: . n buzzkill :kek: nah i dont have nitro :Dopeysad: :marafrogemoji: Taxytubbies :kek: Because just like drugs, we can be addicted to our friends for life :kek: Or like the whole saying with “Your love is my drug”

Even women hate women being powerful and successful :dead: :judgeyfroge: :MunchlaxMunch: Tis another Choices pattern Harper did mention she still had surgeries assigned on the side But yeah Apparently if MC had caseloads on the side along with the diagnostics duties, so can Harper with her surgeries and diagnostic duties As shown in Book 2 Juggling stuff like that is probably impossible irl Anyhow Oof I don’t watch medical dramas so idk squat :dead: Anyway They put her on the team for one thing and one thing only: the rivalry. Now we have people down in the Instagram comments making edgy edgelord threats against a POC female character I cringe at the very thought Because in the first book, they hinted at some “romantic history” But honestly she was so underused She was just there because “overwhelming pressuring aunt” to Aurora And now, the whole Ethan thing does feel so random All of a sudden, those two being in the same room for more than five minutes = reminiscing on a bunch of memories while getting sidetracked MC is literally there as a third wheel But uh sure, let’s re-determine female empowerment as “competitive primates in the wild” by doing that shit in OH3 Prolly Bloom still behind-the-scenes Has his own private team or sum Idek It’s gonna come up eventually Hence the psychic telling MC last chapter: “Bloom is up to no good.” In other news, the sky is blue :kek: We do 24/7 :glasses: Same hat He existed only in Bk2 Ch 1 because “old friend of Ethan’s who lets him stay late because favored owed” and that was it Jackie went to Harvard iirc Let’s be real, any real life location exists in the Choices world as well. PB just prefers to make up fictional locations and names for the fun of it No matter how basic and generic they can be Me no understand this sports talk :kek: But anyway yeah, the names are just so dull Fries are always valid Eww Not my hometown having a Taco Bell and DelTaco on opposite sides of a four way intersection :kek: The same logic applies to when two gas stations are placed across the street from each other Like subtle rivalries? i love to see it i like how Ethan is both the most favorited and hated :kek: :partay: woot  woot ik what you're talking about lmao https://tenor.com/view/ww3-gif-15983076 Hey everyone deserves a Cheat Day 🤷🏻‍♂️ eh i dont really see it tbh. Aria is full on black while Adder appears Caucasian-ish, like her brother or they're ambiguous, take your pick thats also another possibility indeed ,img Choices Raydan .img Choices Raydan lol gnarly ugh and SB being GOC teehee you're welcome :CharmanderHi: Hercules (/ˈhɜːrkjuliːz, -jə-/) is the Roman equivalent of the Greek divine hero Heracles, son of Jupiter and the mortal Alcmene.

Kingsley? never heard of them indeed the lectures back in HWU were actually engaging imo god it takes me back mhm :kek: DEADASS Wetness MC is your typical anti-masker and/or COVID denier IRL Whining about having to stay indoors at all times under lockdown Cassian deserved to be featured in a better book .w Los Angeles Lmao :oliviastab: @Priyudi your dreams have come true i friggin love this emote LMAO I actually understand those struggles Not me being in my community college class pre-pandemic and diamond mining BaBu and the cringy baby theme blasts through my speakers while the class and professor turn around to stare at me :kek: HBD PRIZZA 🍕 have a chaotic day and pls spread chaos, no matter what Voltra says "its not my....BIRTHDAY!" Make it make sense :kek: :niapanic: and Discord :smart: Bruh, what if it’s yet ANOTHER troll account just to mess with maarco lin phaan Only this time, a “good thing” is happening to her instead of a bad one The maarco lin phaan account claimed a journalist from WIRED is doing an article/interview with the Choices fandom and her account caught the person’s attention But it’s just extremely sus to begin with Could be a troll account Could be PB undercover Who the hell knows Let alone one person who owns a spoiler account Must be a slow news day :kek: My name can literally be seen under the Connections of my discord profile so personally I don’t really care. I’m an open book but with certain reasonable boundaries Ikr Totally mind blowing Everything you ever believed in was a lie We live in the matrix 🤯 whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! lmao and im HaDomieHrew noice no more confusing Kyo with Kio :kek: my parents just found "Andrew" easier to remember lol speaking of doge, i just realized the dogekek emote is gone ): aww well what has to be done has to be done :oliviastab: yeah i noticed the emote didnt appear on your end oof :MunchlaxMunch: there it is :kek: hi also me no like extra daylight https://tenor.com/view/broadcity-hissing-sunlight-unwelcomedaylight-vampire-gif-4204993 nice It’s so the mathematicians can feel special :kek: 3/14 “stuck in the past” gang True Pie good Especially pumpkin:dogeheart: Sometimes but it gets old quick lol Reeeee I arise back from the underworld Siwon Nice tan on that man :MunchlaxMunch: 👀 "toxic love" what in the hetero fuckery is this did anyone call this person out on their blatant homophobia? denial wont help them here, its too obvious idk im still a little sus if the person wanted to make it a point that the love triangle itself is toxic, they shouldve put all three LIs in one picture not just singling Ava out huh? i dont remember Ava dating Chad i know you'd think the person mentioned Mason and Bayla only bc those two were the only significant relationships idk i did speed run through this book maybe there was some Chad arc with Ava that i didnt know about im just confuzzled exactly I already read it so I literally don’t mind. Anyway inch resting its the heteronormativity for me :uwuhappy: Why On earth Would you do that :judgeyfroge: Even so, I’d rather eat my cereal dry than with a non milk alternative :niapanic: Especially water of all things :Facepalm: I’ve actually eaten cereal dry too Not that bad Milk makes it better but I’ll have it either way *sigh* Bel Honey Nut Cheerios and Froot Loops for me :DogeLick: Fight me Bel Lies Ngl I’d be down for that, the Oreos I mean Oreos with milk are heavenly Oh yeah I remember seeing those at my local Costco man me getting my first iPad memories: Temple Run, Angry Birds, Subway Surfers and yes even the Devil's game itself, Flappy Bird :kek: No I am wym Timezones just prove that time travel is real. Just take a plane to make it happen :smart: I feel like it should be both racial diversity and actual writing talent that’s needed for PB. Out of the entire company, PB only has 3 POC including chelsa and I feel like that's not a good look especially if PB is trying to write more diverse books so I dont blame them for wanting to find more POC for their team but the person should also be hired because they write well. Not just because they’re a POC :niapanic: i'd honestly be down for a book that dedicates its entirety to exploring friendship, bonds, and group chemistry, childhood memories, and all that ngl Oop I got my hands in my pockets, I’m staring down at the floor How tf does her brain even work like that I’m sorry but just how Bitch, you’ve been leaking spoilers on a public account since the beginning of time. Do you really think PB won’t notice your double life? They’ll catch up to you eventually and when they do, better hope you delete everything on your account in time because your sus ass ain’t getting hired anytime soon How does one’s morals even work like that? :huh: That is a true fact Are you serious? Wow This nutjob clearly doesn’t think before doing, ever “Oh wait I’ve exposed myself before. No matter, I’ll continue leaking stuff because it’s my obligation for whatever reason but I still want a legitimate job as a PB writer uwu” ^ Plus that edit is just so cringy *Given* the backstory with the parents Wishfully thinking, but wouldn’t it be so satisfying to see this person’s account’s downfall if PB were to take legal action or at least some type of call-out post? Using the MLF account as a PSA to once again, ask people not to leak spoilers and assets? 

👉🏼👈🏼 XD ): praise be Queen Mara :CharmanderHi: doing God's work :oliviastab: mhm 100% as in the words of Bernie Sanders: "I am once again asking for you to stop leaking spoilers and server binaries" (yeah im talking to you Maarco Lin Phaan) https://tenor.com/view/side-eye-squint-suspicious-hmm-futurama-gif-8526915 all of PB staff watching out for people leaking their content early :zoeywink: with shifty eyes and judgy expressions :judgeyfroge: LMAO to both above statements we are only human Pri, we make mistakes XD Same goes for Facebook. They’re straight up deleting negative/constructive criticism comments calling them out on their heteronormativity and their resemblance to the Chapters app extremely sus i find it hard to believe that someone like her could be *that* gullible then again, i'd be surprised Indeed. She’s just asking for legal trouble :kek: Girl you ain’t immune from consequences. Companies scour your social media before hiring you. It’s only a matter of time before they stumble upon your spoiler account and be like https://tenor.com/view/warning-gif-6097057 Hmm maybe it’s not as relevant anymore but it prolly depends on the company/establishment you’re applying for But hey I’m glad it worked out for you anyway Lu XD Inch resting :MunchlaxMunch: Indeed Lmao @Metta shame Metta. Shame for not spelling it correctly :kek: You literally did that the last time as well LMAO :kek: And we love you for that :dogeheart: *sigh* Facebook isnt any better either. every time someone tries to compare Choices to Chapters, the comments get yeeted :dead: i havent typed "dat" and "den" since i was 10 years old using text chat on Roblox/Wizard101/Minecraft  :kek: i thought it was such a "cool kids" way of saying that/then :judgeyfroge: Yeah more like this They’ve been around since 1973 Pretty much Lol :kek: Yay!

:worry: what kind of tale, dare i ask? yes lmao but his name is spelled slightly different okay a LOT different https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh he was accused of ||sexual assault|| during his nomination 👀 sure why not, i myself am trying to avoid college homework :KEKWhands: kk noted :MunchlaxMunch: i'll read it after WTD lol yeye 😂 you’re welcome btw and thank you for that rhyme :KEK: screw you Drew owo btw how does this make you feel Mara? :KEK: i’m already halfway finished with your story lol every time he calls her newbie :dogeheart: LMAO i’m drafting up my DM for you as we speak :KEKWhands: :KEKWhands: no. she must hear my review :KEK: :dogeheart: :dogeheart: Happy Holi! gnarly wooooooo! downtime at last it’s not in fact, colors shouldn’t even have a “masculine/feminine” label just like what you like my favorite color in kindergarten was purple but nobody had a problem with that. i just grew up and decided that blue was my fav on my own ye WWII defo contributed to certain gender roles and stereotypes being reversed. like Bel mentioned, all the male dominated jobs and high school activities were left unfilled so when the men went off to war, it was the women that took over the workforce and cheerleading yeah, the pink triangles during the Holocaust :/ oh damn i could almost see it wassup get some rest oof spring beds regardless hope you have a lit spring break! imagine a world where i can afford to go to Disneyland 😔 oh my bad hair day or just simply working with what they got :MunchlaxMunch: adorable welcome! :CharmanderHi: hey Pri! 👋🏼 new member is here, im the only one active in your Wordle thread, and TPS is approaching 💀💀 her nico nico kneecaps i’m referencing the meme 😂 https://youtu.be/Cuh3unwYMzw watch it until the end lol it was so funny the first time i watched it lol XD and the way he just came up with it on the spot i agree, it was realistic to have some “calm before the storm” scenes in a book like that if you’ve heard of the game Until Dawn, you’d recognize an iconic scene where Michael and Jessica were about to have sex and Jessica boasted how “IT WAS GONNA BE HOT” and she gets snatched by a Wendigo through a window :KEK: https://youtu.be/jmIpU1bHy54 PB take notes 🤣🤣 i refer you to this OH meme :KEK: :KEK: oh right, Adam already mentioned it lmao truly :SadCat: potential for IL3 wouldve been really good. the club making it their life's mission to protect the public from ever finding out the truth behind the Power, but it shows its ugly rear end anyway and now all of Oregon is at risk of a bloodbath maybe an apocalyptic type scenario like Weirdmageddon in Gravity Falls, but its contained to just the state of Oregon rather than a small Oregon town in the woods https://tenor.com/view/gravity-falls-bill-cipher-gravity-falls-bill-cipher-gif-22802575 it was one of the more cooler concepts of Gravity Falls that i loved so much. bold of Disney Channel to allow such themes into this show now i just imagine if PB took inspiration from it i mean just look at the artwork potential but hey at least we got a vampire apocalypse in BB and a zombie apocalypse in WTD lol side note: i cant help but ramble about how great it is that the fictional world always writes their horror/supernatural stories taking place almost always in Oregon. just something about it appeals to the writers. the forests, the nature, the urban legends, folklore, Native American legends, etc. lol yeah, its just way more authentic when PB creates a fictional town in the middle of nowhere and have it hold many secrets with a MC either being a knowledgeable local or new kid in town oblivious but also discovering something new fr like when are we gonna have books take place in Seattle? Salt Lake City? Chicago? give us variety they should have their own wheel to turn just have Voltra and I recite the Fifty Nifty United States song and we'll help with the ideas yo, an Oz book hell yes Canada, New Zealand, anywhere they speak english so PB wont likely butcher it lmao bruh had PTR actually been successful, they totally wouldve moved on to more countries rather than the generic European ones yeah :/ PM imo nailed the world travel aspect. a lot of the countries had spice. even AME was bold enough to go to Iceland .cowsay I am offended by this statement. :KEK: LMAO its a "discovering ourselves" retreat. totally didnt piss off an evil corporation ye to meet Matt's dad iirc i dont recall oop but god, id like to see Choices go to Alaska. its such a pretty state not the bible belt 💀 ALASKAN MALAMUTES hey we fought a bear in TC&TF and ILITW (sorta), why not recycle it :KEK: it was mostly European countries but Nicole and Audrey and Violet did go to Istanbul to honor Nana and Pop-Pop ooo pretty oh man Fucking, Austria 😔 sdhklasdhasdl fugging it sounds like middle school me trying to make it clean for myself when i refused to cuss at first i fudging hate this class ouch, right in the childhood 💀 Magic Treehouse was lit srsly? omg ngl that looks cute that’s pretty awesome tho love professors that actually also work in the professional field besides teaching hope y’all stay safe don’t forget the camera panning and zooming violently on their faces and then repeating the same clip several times oop wait but you never mentioned the surface pro lol hold on a sec oh wait i accidentally tapped too fast without reading it my b :KEKWhands: Brent https://tenor.com/view/crying-emoji-dies-gif-21956120 from Mara's wattpad story that she whipped up from her nap i'm still not over that ending :KEKWhands: YES if you can truly a dreamboat mhm woooooo! go Aaron! and then there's me, still belting out in my car while a tissue is stuffed up my nose it’d be very un-Mara of her if she didn’t lol it’s currently raining in SoCal right now and i’m thriving bless I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN CALIFORNIA annoyed, confused, stubborn, angry, disappointed, exhausted, frustrated, and shy hey hey hey im pretty good, hbu? oooo like its underwhelming atm? and you're feeling conflicted because you're used to the mountain of work but after getting a small hill, it feels a bit out of place worried there might be some hidden due date you dont remember btw, Californian here. just wanted to say ive never in my life heard of earthquake preparedness in the form of written exams lmao. you dont prepare properly that way. you actually do it. duck and cover, demonstrations, calm-and-orderly fashion drills that require leaving a building if its still standing wack truly yup pretty much you either feel it or you dont. or just hear about some other one that happened miles away and then worry about aftershocks following a big one and then everybody tweeting about it lol at this point, it just happens once every blue moon. along with a slow and agonizing wait for the Big One to strike like can San Andreas at least be merciful and gives us tiny ones so that the Big One wont be as violent? damn oh yeah truly and i totally understand why its recommended you stay in bed during a quake. if you just ducked and covered underneath it, the debris will bury you and it'll be a while before someone could dig you out. apparently you're supposed to stay in bed and protect your head under the pillow and just hope for the best nope. grades 11-12 thank god that discord outage was shorter than the others Sakuraland: Flowers Only :blobsweat: @unforgivablespelling for tomorrow, CAD should be Voltraland 😂 oh no jlsaksd i was just thinking of the song remember when it took you guys like 5-6 months to realize #📚book-club-land  still wasnt visible? :KEK: dun dun dun im still waiting for my april fools and that my whole life was a lie and i was just chillin in my mom's womb this whole time freakin Kent and freakin Brent :KEKWhands: also take care!! SIMP CARD ^ #ThatsMyRodrick Devon Bostick is hot, plain and simple :KEK: oof really? damn yeah Tatsu has all the server rankings of everyone our profiles, levels, reputation points, etc. LMAO those people are a joke. they already gave the money to them, kinda pointless to destroy the products at that point yeah i feel removing one bot is barely even gonna make a dent anyway. countless other servers will still be utilizing it so its whatever not to mention the fact that at one point, people wanted to boycott Discord Nitro because Discord supports NFTs. yet people are still boosting and sending emotes anyway religious-wise, i grew up in a Vietnamese Catholic family. no typical Buddhist views like most people would expect. and tbh, my parents were so obsessed with practicing it themselves but when it comes to me and my brother, we just tagged along with them to church every Sunday but as we grew up, my brother and i see it more as a once-a-week hobby rather than a main religion. so yeah i pray whenever i have a sick relative or relative's pet that im worried about but when it comes down to it, i havent read a single word from the Bible nor would i want to share it with other people that dont ask for it. i have a friend who's a Jehovah's Witness while the rest of our friend group are 100% atheist, and we coexist just fine. we dont let religion be our main topic of discussion whenever we hang out. we just keep that stuff at home and our respective houses of worship. we just want to make dirty/dark humor jokes all day kids-wise, im open to the idea of adopting some of my own but at the same time, seeing my maturity and willingness, its pretty unlikely. there's always being a doggo parent and my parents are just gonna have to accept that their grandbabies will be four legged furry babies, no matter what my future family will look like lol honestly the very idea of having some religion or book thats been re-edited MULTIPLE times by mankind to satisfy their own agendas determine every move and word i make or say sounds very exhausting. but it helped my parents find peace when they lost their parents and helped me find peace when Rusty died so you know, thats how much i want to practice myself. and yeah if i were to go down the kid route, might just adopt one or two, depending on financial and marital status like Kio aww i love that for you ❤️ but ye, the concept of the Rainbow Bridge honestly puts me more at ease than any other depiction of the afterlife the idea of animals having their injuries and illnesses all healed up the moment they step onto the bridge and will be patiently waiting with the other pets for their humans to come join them :dogeheart: i think he’s referring to your Cookbook bookmark on your screen i will always be honored to have been one of the first few people who accidentally discovered your real name when we were sharing screens of homework 😂 you’re most definitely right O.O Indian rupee yeah 2 dollars actually sound worth it to me :uwuhappy: the shadow behind it and everything ~~on your parents’ vehicles~~ nah i’ve never done anything like that before lol my parents don’t use bumper stickers or decals for their cars elaborate on that one 👀 ooo always wanted to try 3D printing. looks really cool yes do it :uwuhappy: my brother had mine custom made :toooocute: oh damn, at least the frame is able to fit in all four LIs lol ye that looks good! who cares if its not the holidays all year round. show off Lily's santa hat lol understandable xd you'll be tempted to rub your finger on it thinking you actually did crack your keychain lol if there are, i completely forgot what they were xd Olivia Nevrakis she seriously deserved one oop right? yes the colonizers are our weakness error 404 lmao, we must be rid of the spell they cast upon us :KEKWhands: https://tenor.com/view/whitemen-pocahontas-dangerous-warning-thesewhitemen-gif-7210644 but they’re also hot 😩 oh it’s a stray?

PB knew everyone was bored af at home during lockdown so they decided “what the hell” and made them free. imagine how insulted the OG fans felt after they paid their share of 30 diamonds lmao truly they either got with the times and accepted the gradual changes or announced their departure from the app like this is an airport tru plenty of other apps out there :KEK: man remember when Indescribable was the funniest memeable Choices joke? now it’s Desire 😂 looking back, they were actually notoriously short in length lmao it was basically a quickie :worrysip: grabbing on to his length like your life depends on it :KEK: dam of pleasure bursting CLIFF HANGER LMAO bliss and ecstasy are on PB’s own Wheel that they spin before writing the dirty thirty with desire DOESNT QUITE REACH THEIR EYES 😭😭 “the car feels pregnant with unsaid words” :KEKWhands: :KEKWhands: twanging your magic clanger ASDFGHJKL Chocolate s’mores ftw water lol i’m a simple person thinking we could get a QOTD bot in here 👀 cold water after any hot day is refreshing af cold windy gloomy and rainy break out my hoodies anything below 60F *chef’s kiss* blue 💙 my friends when they realized the way i was talking about boys too often :KEKWhands: big same glad to hear! my Rusty is still watching over me as we speak ooh and while we’re on the topic of dogs, i came home on sunday and realized my neighbor’s dog got loose after someone left the gate open. i helped them get him back and they were incredibly thankful. it was an honest mistake and the dog has met me before so we’ve gotten acquainted and he feels comfortable around me. it was such a small samaritan thing but i felt good for the rest of the day here he is btw :) truly 😌 morning all lol omg magestic Appa is one with nature 😌 visiting my mom's sister to meet my cousin's new puppy LOL lmao dont even with all the internet hate on the baby just because of the way he looked 💀 tbh i liked Ice Ages 1-3 but thats about it. i loved to see a cute baby mammoth but 4-5 were definitely meh for me oh yeah she voiced a teenage mammoth in the fourth film iirc :raifepain: at that point they definitely were just milking it brand new planetary disaster one after another lol still tho, cant deny that the other standalone films Blue Sky Studios had done were underrated gems i did only many years after the film released and i got older enough to learn how to use the internet to look things up lol pretty cool one of my favorite spongebob clips Linda? you lied to us all :niapanic: candy is dandy happy easter to those who celebrate! yes. i miss the feeling so much. watching your fur baby dream as their legs suddenly start kicking and then suddenly whining it’s such a nice feeling that they have a soft place to sleep, being taken care of carl is drunk prolly deleted their profile too. might explain why their name didnt show up o imagine having a job to have to do taxes yay! you gotta do what you gotta do work-life balance is okay but being a full time student is also valid i believe in Mara supremacy :MARAONLY: there is no Ruchawar in Ba Sing Se :KEK: historians called it the Great Spoilerland Civil War or coup if you will idk how long it took since it was a blur lmao the new normal. comply or perish LOL that’s a good one :KEK: man its my dream to be insulted in the most British way like that omg there's a video :MunchlaxMunch: no choice but to stan :MARAONLY: tbf the people at Facebook/Meta have been doing a piss poor job for a long while now :KEK: every once in a while, my friends' accounts get hacked and DM me porn links 💀 now imagine my complete and utter shock when i receive one from my aunt :KEKWhands: ;ksdajlsdsh STAWP true if you have your irl pfp on it, it'll most likely be reused in scam accounts. the kind that reply to other people's comments saying

welp guess it varies honestly, sounds like a fun road trip to me 🤷🏻‍♂️ not sure what it is exactly. maybe because San Francisco lies right directly on top of a fault line so for people more aware of geography, not an attractive place to live in. and all Los Angeles has is the glitz and glamor of the rich and famous and beach houses and what-have-you with good traffic, yes if you take the inland highways Pacific Coast Highway takes forever but it is scenic if i ever wanted to visit, i’ll get up at 6 and make it by lunch if i could lmao i was raised in a Viet family filled with morning people. i can handle it :KEKWhands: we’ve gotten up early before just to beat the traffic at the airport before going on vacation lol my parents are way too punctual and i’ve been conditioned to be like them so yeah :okboomer: Pri no i would imagine its a hybrid of sweet and greasy first photo shows non vip releases look at the second photo that shows the vip releases the smile :dogeheart: spring time in california is basically chilly af in the morning and by noon, the clouds clear up and the sun comes out and it suddenly feels like summer came early oh yeah and rain comes once every blue moon lmao you’d only even fully rely on winter to bring you freezing rain, enough to fill up our reservoirs to the halfway point anyway but occasionally we do get rain in the summer too and suddenly it feels like i’m back in Vietnam visiting family again. me no like sticky rain breaking people's car windows should not be illegal in the case that there's a living breathing animal or child in the car. i've heard some people getting so pissed about their broken windows like sir/ma'am, you left a dog/child in there willingly. idc for your accident excuses. its common sense to not leave a young loved one inside you reap what you sow the summers are brutal, esp in the Southern USA. just dont leave anyone in the car alone. you dont have to take them everywhere with you. just leave them at home with a caretaker and go on with your day Starboard is finally back online and i love the first thing it pulls up :KEK: truly the pinnacle of art happy Pride Month all!!!!

:blobsweat: .w Los Angeles a solid 100 F in my hometown 🥲 we’ll be saying goodbye to triple digit heat by the weekend more profusely sweating? i have not they're hellbent on us conserving energy between 4 and 9 PM LMAO FR but gov't isn't allowed to say squat about rich people because rich people are funding their political campaigns speak of the damn devil :raifepain: even as a Californian, i think its overly ambitious and in this day and age, our government would have to pay each and every one of us an incentive to even consider going out and buying an electric vehicle lol my fam has one and it works pretty well for us on long trips so i got no complaints. we even have our own charger right in the garage but i defo want to see more charging stations within close range right next door to already existing gas stations that will likely shut down in the near future lol but hey, if we can be more environmentally friendly, i'm all for it we're already building light rail so it's trucking along i've always wanted to ride in one and see what its like ooo next stop: hydrogen powered cars Tesla will soon have to step aside as long as there's less gas guzzlers backfiring and pumping exhaust fumes into the air :dogewink: i mean we are a society that is heavily reliant on the big oil industry because they convinced us we should be a bit unrelated but i can also see why a lot of internet forums say that American suburbia is poorly designed. sure you have all these "nice" but generic Levittowns and other versions of planned communities but they were built purposely to be far away from the nearest workplace/commercial shopping area where its most convenient for people to commute to without the struggle and since we have little to no mass transit in little ol suburbia, we *have* to buy cars just to go to the nearest grocery store or big box warehouse when in other places, the nearest food market is a short walk away only time will tell 🤷🏻‍♂️ people are already favoring rideshares over taxis and ambulances because they're cheaper and way more convenient ironic isnt it but you know, socialism evil and healthcare in all shapes and forms is not a basic right :sadclown: >.> <.< big oil will continue funding gov't while we'll remain lightyears away from a decent high speed rail 😔 playing Choices for the past 18+ hours i shouldnt be one to judge. i once accidentally left Sims 3 open for two days LOL damn rip i have another British friend in another server who couldnt care less he gives her credit for being a comforting figure in times of tragedy but other than that eh we may be on fire and in a drought but nothing will stop us from waking each other up from an eternal sleep :KEK: mood ooh natural science rocks 🗿 AYYY WELCOME BACK MILQUE!

Oh you mean like student MCs and YA MCs who already have careers Wait Nvm Luckily I never play female faces in books where you can choose MC’s gender The good thing about OH male MC faces are that they’re never reused Literally one type of male MC face has been reused twice TE male faces were reused in NB BSC male faces in PTR lel Yup Eh not really Those were more edited to look slightly different Not the exact same but modified versions Agreed Swoon at the male Asian face :uwuhappy: :smart: Either Jocelyn or Britney from ILITW Hmm I’m seeing a little bit of both Jocelyn and Britney Like a hybrid :hmm: But at the same time Ya ^ 👀 BoJo the Clown strikes again Agreed smh They did her dirty the minute her sprite was reused in that one OH2 chapter It really do be like that gn :redfieldangry: Ah it’s almost October October will be It Lives binging Since PB failed to deliver us a third It Lives last year and now this year, it’s all we got 😔 Ooh I might even replay NB and THoBM when I have the time afterward Same Shorty but a goodie NB had potential The Walkers have been **CANCELLED** for a while now ever since the barn wedding chapters hell yeah Mara 👀 Mara is radiating with gruesome murder energy rn and im here for it omg next murder book TNA valid you do realize Mara isnt an actual psychopath irl right? its just her fictional inspiration ~~but she can feel free and kill me too~~ ^ 🤔 y'all are sending each other mixed messages and i find it entertaining for some reason night spoopy nightssssssss :redfieldangry: Mr. Red will be watching ig if PB isnt gonna give us a third It Lives for spooky season, then BaBu will have to do very true the womb is a portal and you never know whats gonna come out of it https://tenor.com/view/the-big-bang-theory-sheldon-gif-12501820 same but mine is Monster House It Lives in the Womb *Priya enters the chat with a knife* oh no Lythikos guess the one thing Hana wasnt talented at was surviving :kek: i was gonna say who's Barrier? lmfao and caucasian Ina deadass looks like a Karen :kek: jajajajajaja they deserve a whole ass statue Don’t underestimate the power of stupidity People tend to hate what they don’t understand Sofia belongs in the Louvre there hasnt been anything since the bloody sneak peek :hildasad: i just want...anything thats not romance exactly lmao they knew it was a failure after all it was experimental from the beginning even PB wants to forget about Wetness it would seem we must pray i wouldnt even mind if it had subtle VOS vibes i was so excited when i first saw that agreed Sam and Dave and Hero MC are lost in the cosmos 😦 :kek: so much accuracy Hero deserved better and It Lives deserves a proper conclusion everything's written, but not drawn... *sighs* same, they outdid themselves in ILB with the horror art ES and Hero had that unique comic book/anime-ish type of style ): fuck the heteronormative romance https://tenor.com/view/pepe-why-pepe-the-frog-sad-crying-gif-16026853 the tiresome tropes and the predictable Choices book formula STD technically had that as well but we all dont like Justin lmfaoooooooo lol Choices just needs to stop with the matchmaking diamond choices bc its kinda dumb now Becca actually becomes nice while Poppy had no redemption arc oop lol Choices books almost always wraps up a plot and then give you a diamond choice to give your rivals a piece of MC's mind or like QB and PM's case, still flirt with the enemy they really wanted to go down the one LI route like TNA and Wetness, but at the last second *insert LI thats actually the MC's age here* the professor route is def not popular Zoey did have the "obligatory fashionista best friend" trope when she first appeared God I love the new emotes We’re just abusing them now > like new shoes you gotta use them til you’re tired
Words to live by :garbryce: :garbryce: Too true OMFG CLEVER :kek: @MaralinaSakura Oop Wdym? Like are we able to delete our own messages? No I don’t think so It’s still gonna be in their notifs what are those? still so many terms idk ah ive been doing that lately oof :kek: Yes it did God I miss COD I think it’s really cool EA let PB reuse some key aspects of their games in their own like HSS Prime: Kimi Chen and Owen Harris from SHS 
and 
Mansingh Transglobal in Choices from COD like it was mentioned before Same. :dogeheart: Oop With nothing but TRH and RT releasing, I agree Schedule be like https://tenor.com/view/tumbleweed-desert-deserted-alone-lonely-gif-6156103 :Dopeysad: :jebus: Nah it’s not just you RT is just meh to me and TRH is shite. Again to me Oh god don’t even get me started with BaBu2 Everything ongoing right now is just a diamond mine to me Aye same. It wasn’t perfect but I still enjoyed it nonetheless Agreed Those two are the ones keeping me from deleting the app, that and replaying books from 2018 Hell a BOLAS2 announcement would be awesome but Andrew works hard so I’ll let him do his own thing. I love that king DS was the exception for me As mixed as it was, I liked it, as flawful as it was Ugh Zig deserved a man if MC chose someone else. It would’ve been amazing af if he got with his roommate Aaron I don’t think they ever did ): Not canon anyway Agreed Ugh my gay heart :dogeheart: The one time I spent diamonds in the entire Freshman series and it was to take those two to the petting zoo and when MC got to name one of the animals, I chose Zigaron or something like that and the two just shrugged it off as some friends thing 💀 IT WAS MY SHIP NAME FOR YOU TWO TF Lol Nah Zigaron fits better :hmm: Chris Powell and ROE MC I dunno Just off the top of my head Zoey expressed attraction towards Male Professor Kingsley so Either way, Zoey = bicon :bife: :bisexualbite: True chiz i...dont know how to feel about the new font :huh: lol same from NB? im not sure all it says on the Wikia is that she grew up in New Mexico :niapanic: :bartiemad: :bartiemad: :hmm: Never forget :hawyee: Friggin August 28 and then never mentioned ever again Happy birthday! 🎉 The old books were the good books I’d say give it a little more chance and time. If your mind still hasn’t been changed by the end of the book, then it’s cool 🤷🏻‍♂️ It just depends if you’re into the fantasy scene I personally liked all of them but I don’t remember which ones were quote where things picked up Ye that The bigger the party becomes, the more interactions and scenarios I hope you enjoy! :hmm: :jebus: :jebus: :jebus: Who? _ _ same Male Asian Hayden is just :dogeheart: most likely doubtful, theyve had to be corrected so many times :nope: No :jebus: Same I just hope it won’t be too generic and cliche Where everyone actually acts like adults and not go on childish tirades Right? Ye we established that in #🗺scandals-without-apples :JoJoThink: Tumblr is a cesspool anyhow. Everyone there acts all high and mighty I only see ERR so far Not TRM Yeah they’re really trying their hand at a Spanish TRR Nah even @Arzaylea can confirm, there’s a LOT of mistakes MW barely focused on anything outside the cop crime thriller topic what exam *isn't* stressful Yup hoo boy :ohgodohduck: MW2 😭 Hero 2 ROD2 will never come either Stop Don’t do that to me :Dopeysad: :bartiemad: Sadly true Me too its talking about the future of the Choices app in general, not a specific book hmm i can kinda hear what you mean im playing both at the same time QB counts as “scandal?” Weird... Also RIP horror category getting any recognition Oh wait a sec, it still appears on my end :Dopeyhappy: ikr?! :dogeheart: :marafrogemoji: Huh? Metta likes TRM? Holy shit, I never knew I’m making Satan proud 😈 ACOR was pretty cool some might argue the female empowerment was a bit shoehorned but eh, the historical accuracy was more or less okay tho its debatable yeah i still need to brush up on my Roman empire history interesting how Marc Antony was portrayed as a ridiculously hot guy in past works of on-screen fiction sorry im still processing "you dont speak truth" :kek: Nope, TRM was merely a prequel, showing how Kenna’s legacy crumbled into nothing but parties and drama as solutions The only thing I loved about it was the Pomeranian :dogeheart: The most handsome boi Kenna continues to roll in her grave as we speak. The Rys name has been tainted But we still like the fact that Olivia bears a striking resemblance to her ancestor, Zenobia. Like what is going ON in that gene pool over the years :marafrogemoji: Yeah I also remember VOS being tied into the BB universe, Grant running for the “late Senator Vega’s open seat” Maybe Grant just wants a change of scenery. Some people are willing to move to a different state to pursue their career goals I think the same applies to politics? Ah I see Wack See, BB and NB being connected makes HELLA sense since it’s revealing that not only vampires exist but an entire night world of supernatural creatures: Fae, trolls, wolves, the whole shebang. Sadly NB did not succeed as a spin-off enough to warrant a whole series :Dopeysad: Ooh and It Lives with TE A shadow creature only spotted on the west coast 👀 And I’m surprisingly okay with HSS being connected with TRR. Emma and Myra keeping up with the Royal Gossip news Yup At least it made some sense lol GOD yes No worries at all, self-care is important. Take time off for you and yourself :ohgodohduck: Hell no, hell no, hell no They should really expand to more USA cities like Salt Lake City, Seattle, Chicago, etc NYC is practically mainstream for Choices at this point ROD took place in LA But RCD is definitely stereotyped because Hollywood Let’s see, we also had LH in San Francisco Ooh maybe Palm Springs or Sacramento Yeah I was gonna say PB will try and butcher that country’s language :marafrogemoji: Australia and UK book would be cool Yo if they ever feature koalas in Choices books, I would die happy They’re so friggin cute ooh Canada book when? remember there was a time when we werent allowed to star anything in cursed chat? :dogekek: Carlbot said otherwise :OOF: Not necessarily the starred message itself but the fact that it came from cursed chat See, if people were to star a bunch of NSFW content Willy-nilly, then we would have a problem because the entire server will see it, including our underage folks :Dopeysad: :marafrogemoji: Thank you! Yeah I hear a cricket in the background of this track It’s so annoying and I’ve complained multiple times to PB but of course this isn’t their top priority so now we better get used to it... 🤷🏻‍♂️ man im replaying the track rn and i miss NOT having to hear a cricket chirping in the background :killme: everyone must know about our Lord and Savior Priyudi she obviously gets automatic membership im not but i wish you luck regardless :dogeheart: petition to change this server's name to Studyland so we can help Pri :kek: ye we've become an inner circle 😉 a Chaotic Inner Circle basically but unlike them, we wont commit illegal hazing tru NOOOOOOO ANYTHING BUT THAT https://tenor.com/view/coronavirus-out-of-this-house-cross-get-out-gif-16681717 ah you mean groupchat Bel thought GRP was an acronym :dogekek: https://tenor.com/view/the-simpsons-mr-burns-evil-laugh-evil-laugh-gif-4076853 we love to see it right? TE is the best. even the little things are cool to look at Aww Scribblenauts! One of my first apps I played when I got my first iPad God where did my innocent days go This Maxwell is hella valid Not afaik Eh I mean i knew both a male and female Blaine back in middle school when I was put into a history class with both of them so :dogekek: Poppy isnt even a LI smh why was she even an option lmao right? the simping couldnt be more obvious the hypocrisy 🤡 :OOF: personally i preferred OH2 bc Bryce TRH3 was trash period Bryce before his glow up hrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhh Womp-womp 😏 Yup They are. In a diamond scene, you got to play Lookout with Emma and Luis and you versus a team from the Hartfeld game crew, which consisted of Tripp and Madison iirc The nicknames were uncanny Lol but its hilarious :dogekek: I have just above 900 bby :zoeywink: Eh if I’m bored enough and feeling motivated, I can easily do it no problem Depending on if I like the book or not If you guys are replaying something, I think TF side stories will count. These guys are 1-2 chapters so if PB counts them as a full book and tap through them, you can easily get that one large reward Damn Well it was a long shot anyway I can always rely on you to correct me Lu 😂❤️ I mean it tho, I hate it when I misinform people Yup I know Bel, Lu already informed me on the situation It’s fine lol That’s nice, kick a man while he’s down Jkjk Ily Lmao 😔 those fucking scared me PB really made TRH function on unrealistically insufferable antagonists Agreed with all of the above Anton was a decent villain Facts with the Challenges, yes that is a true fact its quite rare when the majority of the fandom unite to hate on that one character ~~can you blame me if i like tall, dark, and handsome~~ *meep* *swoon* Lu and I apparently have the most unpopular tastes in men in this entire server :kek: ~~but mostly me~~ ~~that is a true fact~~ from Platinum alhdlhhf;ahsfjsdkaf Julybugs! Im an Augustbug :dogewink: :marafrogemoji: Oh good lord, Royal series will have the same number of books as the TF main series :killme: Unpopular opinion but yeah I have to agree. It is a bit unfair to assume. Hell, it might just be a freaky coincidence for all we know. I’m not excusing Andrew of anything, I’m just saying, maybe we’re reading way too much into it Yeah, I'm thoroughly convinced it's a coincidence. Claiming a writer has a vendetta against ginger-haired women is really...out there Pri’s friend who used to be on this server asdfghjkl :kek: 👀
👃🏼 
👄 Fuck you 403 Forbidden Error message Personality: introvert

I like this MC already :dead: i definitely agree with all of the above, 100%. its an all-too familiar trend we've seen with Choices books. at the very beginning, they really did try to be diverse with genres, hence "choose romance, fantasy, and mystery" and surprise surprise, they did all have end goals where even the non diamond choices help progress the story further. as time went by and more romance ads that are churned out, more romance fans are being enticed to play, not for the story, plot, or artwork, but for the LIs. hence why the app has recently been demoted to nothing but family fluff from TRH and BaBu, and choices and decision making becoming less than irrelevant and useless. it sucks, it really does, and we all have different types of scenarios to pin the blame on. whether its Nexon aquiring the company, the rise in the FB mom population and their money being spent on sheer romance and family fluff rather than books like TE and IL, writers being laid off, the pandemic, its just a whole ass mess and it sucks to watch from the sidelines like people are free to spend their money however they want i guess, but really, to what end? a customizable background that'll prolly barely show up again? flashy outfits that will only appear once in a book/lifetime as if this was some Prom or Homecoming or wedding? i just dont understand the spending habits of the fandom sometimes, and it just results in a stupid Domino effect Which is ironic, considering they willingly and voluntarily put themselves through the emotional stress and anxiety of losing a fictional baby to a “big bad bully” antagonist to the point where they threaten to sue PB over it That’s far from escapism if you ask me Yeah more irony on that front. The diamond choices don’t even matter to a certain extent. It’s the same formula over and over again. Spend diamonds to make friends with side characters, you lose temporarily, go and find some loophole or shenanigan to make the antagonist look bad, the good guys win once again. And then inb4 they introduce yet another shady antagonist People often express their frustration that the diamonds they spend don’t even matter but idk why they still complain since they get their cheesy “happily ever after” anyway Goes to show the diamond choice and non diamond choices, just aren’t relevant anymore. The story moves on to a good ending, with or without them Me remembering the time way back when TC&TF’s and MW’s score/point earning system allowed for lockable/unlockable choices which actually brought a little spice into the books and had a genuine impact. And now I’m sad Hence why Kenna gets a choice of LIs to pursue. Personally I’m a DomxKenna stan because I’m a sucker for childhood friend romances but overall, I loved the design of TC&TF, everything about it was just perfect. And with MW, there were literally no romance routes and I was fine with it. All I cared about was the crime thriller aspect. Even Dave and Sam’s tragic backstories helped build up their personalities which I’m perfectly fine with. I just liked that unlike current MC’s today, Kenna and Sam were not ditzy airheaded clueless damsels-in-distress who constantly need men to bail them out of a sticky situation. They got assistance and help but don’t rely on piggybacking to pursue their goals. But that’s just my two cents Personally I could do without the outfit system. I know PB is never gonna retire the Closet feature in the near future but it is what it is. Personally I would love a book where “dressing for the right occasion” just isn’t relevant. They’re nice to look at, sure, but man go back to the stories where we don’t have to go to some fancy party. Another common trope in Choices books; having to attend some fancy formal event just for an excuse to pick out a premium outfit But hey, it’s whatever Just wishful thinking on my part ugh thats more likely when instagrammers block you, their profile appears as "page isnt available" lol Indeed Doesn’t change the fact that MLF’s account wouldn’t be missed if it were to be taken down. The watermarking posts and unnecessary edits that ruin the entire idea of inclusivity, i could go without laws is lawyer book, crimes is cop/mystery book :garbryce: Not Bel answering his own trivia question four days later :kek: Man I miss Kahoot In the classroom lol :kek: ***without you my friend*** ***when i see you again*** you just *had* to ruin the song smh jkjk how.... ^ ~~uncultured~~ lol :kek: oh wait S means bad? oh then nvm then gotta put that in #📮discord-suggestions-and-requests :judgeyfroge: ^^^^ Do it It’s *chef’s kiss* my slow ass realizing that Nick from HFTH and Carter from QB had the exact same shirtless sprites, tho Nick's chest looks more oily and Carter looks dry as hell same reused body posture, both arms on hips and everything gnarly 🤷🏻‍♂️ lmao Pero why im still mourning Dave Reyes, Kenna Rys, and even Chris Powell all in a row 😔 ugh not yet likely this Friday mlm icon when 😔 :/ could be ATV she's useless at both queen and duchess, cant change my mind :kek: and later meh stfu Metta :judgeyfroge: first of all, i aint daddy, so that aint me second of all, personalities dont matter to me so much as a MC who should be knowing wtf he/she is doing in their respective fields :garbryce: i miss Book 1 Bryce 😔 mhm Eww no Cancel TNA to put the 100% effort into OH again Fax No WB was only for their social media accounts Choices app icon itself on my iPhone is still ROD MC and Logan Rip Android users Having to look at *that* :judgeyfroge: Yeah they should really consider changing it. The ROD stans continue to berate PB for it to this day and the Choices icon is a reminder of it ^ This MLM icon ftw Man Ngl seeing Choices at least show their appreciation for the MLM fans would be most appreciated Same with the Sienna peeps Extremely FA is wrapping up soon, and all that’s left is OH and BaBu returning.... Yeah that too ig Same hat Fae Indeed Right? Yeah Book 2 would be its own redemption The story itself is making it a big deal so I do hope it results in something more *more* Yeah like I wouldn’t be totally mad but I’m still gonna be disappointed Lol same. It’s fine to dislike the book in general and only be there for that one LI :MunchlaxMunch: All the scenes with him have been oh so casual and wholesome and we love to see it PB at least did a decent job with the whole childhood loves arc with Tatum We love to see this :kek: rip It Lives 😔 NB couldve been BB's sister series but alas the lore was just vague lord knows a lot more people were attached to ROD they said they had the script for Hero, just not the art budget yeah it was just a worthless pacifier that went into our mouths to get us to shut up DS 😔 couldve been so much more yeah there was no denying it was popular :kek: Scott Lee would like to adopt Bubblegum Pretty much No It’s the obsession for details for me :kek: Jkjk Nothing wrong with being observant You do realize we have ads and Challenges right? Heh yeah I have 2400+ so I’m chillin That’s valid Still I love the nostalgic feels and Memory Lane vibes nonetheless Reminds me of a time when PB actually cared about quality content And my ignorant ass continues to think they’ll return to their glory days but that ain’t happening anytime soon BOLAS Hands down Yeah i too think I could’ve tolerated QB a bit more if the LI ratio was more evenly acceptable. I miss the standard two male/two female system Don’t get me wrong, I like Zoey but Kingsley is creepy and I just think QB is overrated imho :/ Ethan’s heart eugh Same tbh Indeed Yes like I’m a diehard Mal stan but even then I enjoyed the story more than the romance itself BOLAS was so refreshing 100% Bryce 😔❤️ Or at least make the effort of returning the choice concept like from the MW and TC&TF days If PB could just dial it down or at least eliminate insufferable MCs as a whole, especially from those horny books to begin with, I would be a happy camper Yeah back when PB were so confident and assured that their next book was gonna be a hit. Hence when MW said Book 1 at one point and yeah even ATV Then “Book 1” said bye and received standalone status Exactly Yeah I miss earning points in Choices books. I found it a really nice and fun concept Honestly who even knows the inner working mechanisms of PB as a whole He was the saving grace when it came to BOLAS The one good thing about 2020 Choices She just simply got sidelined A lot Barely non existent In general But yeah mostly from the jump No it’s been there for a while now True Because they’re pandering to different audiences They used to be I think it changes every once in a while We don’t speak of MTFL :kek: My Two Fool Loves My Two Remaining Brain Cells Dying True, I don’t regret the diamonds I got out of it she goes to jail regardless its part of the story when ||Duffy shoots her in his reveal chapter at the police station|| how long has it been since you last read VOS Pri? xD VOS is one of my most favorite books so ofc i remember it all down to the very essential details :dogeheart: but yeah she does learn of her future grandchild before succumbing to her fate yeah she really put aside her snobby rich white woman personality aside just enough to give Kate her full encouragement ): :pb: Therefore, too much Must we draw you a picture Bel? :kek: :e_minor: :e_minor: PB just likes to toy with our emotions and pain, that’s all Yeah like cool, good for the streamer but what about our IL3 :aPES_Sob: ES ye in a way Wanna bet it’s only for a few days and homegirl is gonna come right back making some emotional message about how much she misses the fandom during her brief break :PES_Hmmm: :e_minor: :e_minor: I was correct, but at what cost :NM_worryCry: Do it Lu :MunchlaxMunch: I know I know. Just wishful thinking on my part 😂 She absolutely does not Judging by overuse of emojis in her caption, it’s clear that she likes to be extra, extremely extra The woman is too perky for her own good What did The Endless ever do to you? :kek: MLF is known for her spoiler account. Similar to this server Spoilerland, she posts her assets and edits on her Instagram account. It’s usually private or public depending on her mood but it’s more riskier to do it on Instagram than Discord Needless to say, she’s known for her obsession with white male LIs, gay erasure edits, and straight up hypocrisy when dealing with “those other fans” of the fandom This is what happened to me when I dared to professionally dislike TRH on a public forum :kek: tAkE tHaT yOu bIg bUlLy She does What can I say. I was feeling nostalgic LMAO :judgeyfroge: its the AME music for me :kek: :judgeyfroge: Calm your ta-tas. I meant to respond to the screenshot itself, not your comment :ConfusedCat: Hey Pri! :Wave: Yay!! :yay: Good I don’t have any bitch Whatthefuckever Please you wish Me and Lu are legally classified as an old married couple And you’re petty, what of it Not to mention tedious since you really said the same thing twice. Now your material is about as dry as mine :SmugSaber: Correction: the D stands for dumbass but nice try Excuses, excuses :samsungyawn: What, dumb & revolting? Eh I like mine better Because I’m both dumb and revolting :pleb: I never said I was funny, skank And you’re a lil bitch, do something about it 💋 How about no Dancing ain’t for me :jebus: LMAO no man bun on that one Good boy There he goes Bad bot .img duh :judgeyfroge: Oop Seems that way LMAO Interrupting the thought process, smh Rood Khaan’s sprite deserved better than that Inch resting Regardless phat mood 🤣🤣 I mean if you have all the time in the world then go for it Otherwise spend money on the keys? 😅 Three hour wait it is then lol cruel and unusual torture Literally 10/10 amazing movie i mean it did originate from his human name, Douglas Redfield. and since MC and their friends were kids, kids always come up with cute short nicknames for the fun of it, so the nickname Mr. Red stuck eh true ngl when i first played this book for the very first time, i really thought he was some red demon monster then he was revealed as a shadow monster and i was like aight cool i can dig this yeah only when he's mad :redfield: The one thing me and PB have in common: we do not know our maths :kek: probably HSS for me :kek: i should think so, yes which is why i was so overly excited about AME3 at first while everyone else was hating it bc im a sucker for traditional gay weddings dont get me wrong, i loved the Handfasting in ES, but i also love a simple tradition with tuxes and vows and stuff hell if i could, id do a cheesy Vegas eloping irl which ironically is what Adam suggested when i chose to marry him are traditional Indian ceremonies not your type? that bad? i see i see religion based weddings are just kinda meh the more i think about it, monetarily-wise, the more i would just like a simple cheap ass small gathering with a close group of friends. i am definitely not the formal extravagant glamorous type :e_minor: :uwuhappy: Sadge Lame ^ Lame Oh wow :EYES: Oop :judgeyfroge: Choices in Spanish should’ve never existed to begin with if its just gonna be half-assed, why even bother waste of resources imo :PepeHands: with every new book, comes a new cringy ad :kek: oh no oh jeez, enemies to lovers :lmaoNO: but like, weird lol the book description: "ever wondered what it was like to romance your very own Zom-bae?" now here's your chance!" Earth science gang Aww that’s cute Sounds like a teacher that actually loves their job and puts in the effort to make it fun for the students as well Wish my school had more of those Truly literally Donahue's wasnt even that iconic to the story i can guarantee that if PB did something like Berry High school spirit merch, *that* would make a lot more sense and money God is she on her bullshit again You know what deserved a petition more? It Lives :DoD_Pensive: no i think that was someone else ^ desperate and entitled, yes LMAOOOOOO NOT MY BRYCE :kek: I mean, there’s this :kek: Just constructively criticized the deeply milked Royal series and uh apparently, calling it out for its flaws and recycled regurgitated tropes is “bullying” and I’m the “big bad bully” :DogsOfDiscord_2_SMUG: I know, I’ve been a mean bully :chad_moment: :NM_Kekw: I got this one playing BSC2 LMAO Pretty sure some of y’all have seen it by now :demonvillager: ASDFGHJKL IAN TOO :KEKWhands: :kek: :PES_ThumbsUp: inch resting drag race book when? we need more queens and kings up in here yes they did RCD was meh to this day, i still wished and preferred it be a Hollywood U book even in the OG app, the story felt unfinished there was a lot more that could be produced its even funnier bc PB caved in so easily to the whole Rafael debacle which happened to coincide with the intensified BLM movement guess TRR is just more successful than OH i suppose stan Scott MaralinaSakura — 06/11/2021

where did you see this? oh, if its a meme, then its prolly not real lmao but if you can find a leak or spoiler, then its prolly real xd yeah exactly yeah i thought so lmao Aku, one of the things you need to learn about the Choices fandom is to never take memes seriously XD they're not reliable sources of info. they're only used to roast lol noooooo you're fine lsdfjdfdfdfdfdfdfh ~~besides only i'm allowed to be the gullible dumb Asian of the fandom~~ i love to see it :gorguetea: i've been with PB since HSS Prime and it really hurts to see them become like this. used to be all about genuine promises and delivering them now there's a bunch of exclusion and shitty corporate methods because crimes are cool 😎 https://tenor.com/view/gorilla-spinning-funny-war-crimes-gif-18253130 gross, not another wedding book The Birthing Affair :kek: not tonight, watching youtube videos. maybe some other time 😔 U R very ✨ cash money ✨ @Metta :kek: all my homies remember Gabriel and Leon 😔 kif NOT THE APPROPRIATE CHANNEL LMFAO the underage kids in this server will see this :judgeyfroge: lmao stop that is cursed whitewashed :KEKWhands: no false incorrect not true :deargodhelp: :judgeyfroge: sleep Aaron yes sleep uwu you deserve it after all your hard work another day, another migraine ha ha ha migraine ooo rip go ahead https://tenor.com/view/squidward-another-day-another-migraine-headache-work-gif-16473390 :KEKWhands: :heheadrian: when VIP books lose their VIP status, they're no longer advertised on the app's Featured Tab its just a regular book like everything else in the Choices library recommended books are usually ones you have not read at all yet i presume wack Josephine: bet smexy 👀 NOW THATS A CURVEBALL Han is hot yes compared to Adam, i actually liked Slater more surfer hottie the tank top and shorts, yum thanks i hate it they could’ve kept Bianca’s name and it’d still make sense there was really no point in changing it for a reuse i wouldn’t put it past PB justice for bianca sandoval she was bestie tho NorCal girl what’s xcal when i said NorCal, i’m referring to Northern California 🤦🏻‍♂️ that makes sense and seeing how a lot of californians are moving to texas lmao Turn Texas Blue Challenge that and because of the homeless crisis and rising housing prices yes but california republicans are too dense to see it they think it’s a “democrat blue liberal state bad” exclusive issue like uh, wake up. it’s not just in the most progressive state in the country. it’s nationwide :aislame: :deargodhelp: thank god that my phone lets me create shortcuts so i can play choices while still being able to look at the icon without cringing. i miss the og icon so obvs i chose it truly 😔 if you want i highly recommend it PB's golden age was during HWU and HSS Prime days, fr yeah nothing we did in HSS Prime or HWU is technically canon according to PB lol i still wished Chris Winters had a husband rather than wife, he was super gay when i romanced him in HWU lol it be like that 😔 right?! everyone was also fawning over Addison Sinclair agreed everyone we met from HWU deserved more screen time no sign of Bianca Stone, Lance Sergio, or even Lisa Valentine :/ omg Aria! i loved her LMAO same i genuinely liked dating him Christian music :kek: sweetheart it’s called the internet. you can’t control the masses no matter how many cronies you hire in an attempt to perform “crowd control.” that’s why SPL makes people promise not to leak spoilers outside of this Discord server. because we’re actually careful about the assets and scripts. you on the other hand, MLF, put your own watermarks on everything. anyway i’m glad people are exposing you left and right, whether or not it was intentional. it’s about time you learned that there is such a thing as consequences of your actions

-thank you for coming to Big Bully Andrew Bui’s TedTalk eugh can they just like confront her already? i’d love to see that shitfest being stirred up 
👉🏼👈🏼 honestly just delete yourself from instagram as a whole. you’re doing nothing on there but pinning multiple targets on your back anyway she does this to herself and she’s too dense to even realize that we love to see that queen shit do you know about the MLF drama Aku? 👀 basically there’s this person from the Choices instagram fandom who, just like spoilerland, loves to access assets and scripts for Choices books ahead of time and shares them with like minded people. only difference between spoilerland and MLF is that she does it irresponsibly on an instagram account that’s either public or private depending on her mood. she also happens to follow Choices’ actual instagram account. in other words, she could literally be caught leaking their very private tech stuff and could possibly face legal trouble, whether or not it’s minor or major leakage. not only that, she’s known for making cringe edits in which there was gay erasure on certain characters like Ines from OH, shipping her with Zaid rather than her actual wife. also she’s way obsessed with male characters, even as a cishet woman herself. she’s just obsessed on a whole other level oop well i don’t know much about that part of her life so i tend to forget that portion anyway bottom line, she’s mad sketch and hypocritical. thinks of herself as high and mighty with the spoilers but when she gets called out on it, she pretends to not see it oh damn now this is new to me ah oop yes i c doxxing herself, even if its just like, a tiny bit yikes welp one step closer to connecting the dots she makes it too easy its not even you she just lays it out on the table for all to see :MARAONLY: a lot of tea to be spilled, indeed :gorguetea: hey, she wrote a Gaius tree fanfiction, anything's possible :kek: :0 she wishes she got hired (: twas piping hot yeah it just wouldn’t make sense yeah thats whats buggy about the app even after you play the first chapter of a new book, the second time you log into the app, they're like "ayo you havent played this yet, do it now!" :PleasePBJustStop: :kek: https://tenor.com/view/cant-unsee-how-to-unsee-blind-homer-simpson-simpsons-gif-17613101 https://tenor.com/view/throw-smile-easy-mac-book-pro-gif-14004597 El Romance Real the spanish translated TRR someone who used to frequent the Choices Discord fandom and was also into accessing files and assets ahead of time he’s also apparently active on Wikia was very cringy and a huge know-it-all facts lol CQJoker, remember it and avoid it oop he created fake alt accounts to get back into servers he was kicked from from PCF, i forgot why but he was kicked from another server called Choices SYP for shitty behavior against the staff members in their DMs after he got demoted from a staff member to a regular member, he was extremely rude in people’s DMs, calling them names and shit oh that’s right he left voluntarily it wasn’t until he confessed to making an alt account and trying to ping the entire server, that he got kicked, i think :gorguetea: iirc, yes lmao he was extremely condescending like Voltra said. he was such a know-it-all https://youtu.be/RXgER_m08KU he was this Vine in a nutshell https://youtu.be/5LfeJdpk3K4 ahaha so cute 😂 yeah xd this Beckett was fine af BAGHAGAGAASGGS he actually does tho omg dafuq why art why i just assumed its a joke that relates to generic white boy names lmao Travis, Thomas, Garrett do tell 👀 when you can https://tenor.com/view/travis-btb-travis-gif-13025621 lmfao i get the picture frat boy Travis wait lemme try something .ud Travis :hmm: jkdsjga jsdk right?

👀 jkjk i romanced him :KEKWhands: they always have the weirdest smug looks about it as well. like damn, you really think people take you seriously huh? :Facepalm: i just about lost it when the diamond choice appeared LMAO https://tenor.com/view/legendary-battle-worthy-opponent-finally-a-worthy-opponent-our-battle-will-be-legendary-gif-14616660 ^also TNA vs TRR yes esp when i leaned in and realized it said "get outfits for you and your whole family" djklskd the diamond choice thats always guaranteed to repeat pretty much lol milking the milker The Royal Caretaker Affair PB hire Aaron :takemymoney: we star a lot of your book descriptions too so therefore you're highly qualified :PBSeeIToldYouSo: you can always go to Pixelberry's youtube channel for that one lol https://youtu.be/ATom57OV3Ck eh its whatever for me the way that TNA appears twice under both Drama and Steamy :KEKWhands: overall tho, it does look really cool nice aesthetics i zoomed in on the photo and judging by the top view, it looks like FA when it comes to PB, a book with at least one LGBTQ+ character is considered a LGBTQ+ book and then the genre says otherwise lol called it literally anything with a top 10 tag, AME1, OH1, TRR1, etc. welp it does oh wow its a given apparently so lmao so much for choose, romance, fantasy, or mystery (TF, TC&TF, or MW) those were the days yup NB Fae realm background is so underrated and wasted the castle is so pretty :dogeheart: beautiful out of place like when TE music is reused in TNA lmao whats so magickal about a rich dude's apartment building :KEKWhands: OMG i love god the details the shades of blue cute!

If choices were episode then I agree. Episodes/chapters stories are 99% trash so to expect the app to have an outstanding story would be highly ridiculous. But choices started out with outstanding stories but the apps been regressing for the past few years. So I don’t think my expectation is “too high” for this app to do better 🤷🏻‍♂️ And tbh I’m currently working on not minding a smutty book as much with explicitly and steamy sex scenes. I dig that shit, esp of the gay variety. and kinks? I like them too. But these things need to be paired with a kickass storyline. Something original and unique where the plot isn’t just centered on sex. Stories that follow the same cliche trope are outdated, unoriginal and frankly forgettable. it’s the “don’t like it, don’t read it” broken record they keep replaying over and over again :kek: they want to avoid having their logical fallacies called out Hayden and Thomas Hunt i’m good with that :kek: just hoping they have some news about BOLAS2 or even COP yeah :/ disappointment but it is what it is at this point tfw QB is the only non VIP book in the schedule right now. wack still it was shitty of them to go back on their promise well regardless, what’s done is done. no point in dwelling even further weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you know what, yes. i fully support fr tho, he does an amazing job setting the scene just with his voice alone truly. i’ll admit i only came for the voice at first but after learning that little tidbit, i stayed for the personality. it must suck having an illness fetishized like that right?! i love his videos. they’re such a fun bunch to watch being all chaotic as hell and just letting loose :kek: emphasis on the slow :heheadrian: oopsies sexy hoeing your way through the Shadow Realm :smart: ok ngl, i’d spend diamonds on that :kek: :kek: you brought it up :heheadrian: :niapanic: rip Aerin. say hi to Baldur for us LMAO i fixed it to avoid confusion apologies :KEKWhands: LMFAOOOOO LU STOP “WHAT ARE YOU DOING STEP BRO?!” “oh man, now i’m stuck” :( :KEKWhands: ooh are we now officially egosexual? 👀 i made it up just now 😂 tfw BOLAS2 will some sooner than Carter gaining LI status death by horny ok but i’d actually read that :MunchlaxMunch: no choice but to stan :dogewink: lmao PB desdass forgot huh? like straight up slipped their minds oh right, i just scrolled up to this lol dang 51 minutes past noon and still nothing here you go. i got the schedule the forbidden romance: rich and poor LMAO NOT THAT AD if only can’t really blame them 🤷🏻‍♂️ you and your mysterious powers continue to baffle but also amaze me :KEKWhands: :niapanic: :niapanic: it’s ok. i do that to myself on the daily :dead: :raifepain: sdjklakjsdahsdal PB always has a pacifier ready to go into all our mouths :heheadrian: tbf the Royal stans are the same way. announcing their deletion of the app the minute TRR concluded for good LMAO so we know they're not afraid to take risks like that LMAO @kioverity you need to see this LMAO i mean Metta did declare war on Bel today its Carter tomorrow/in a few hours its gonna be Yvette Yassified Yvette nice ring to it LOL no boobs i’m also the clown the m in MLF stands for moron :Facepalm: ASDFGHJKL NOT GROBTAR SOFIA we love u Mara :dogeheart: my conquest for nitro involves leeching off my online friends :kek: THIS :judgeyfroge: no wonder i liked Brooklynne so much. she was the most relatable for me lol lmao i remember that back then the male sprite was the slandering writer so he always died and playing as the girl, whatever choices you picked determined if she died too it’s more like whoever you choose to play as, will die while the other one is alive to witness the shootings you play as Logan Mills then he dies while Theresa Holland survives and vice versa what in the cinnamon toast fuckery is this default version on the cover oh god, ive seen those faces spray painted on their cars. thats how you know if they're a weeb :kek: :judgeyfroge: i can most certainly handle Dick >:) Mara, Pri, you two are my spirit animals cishet dudebro here is clueless to the fact that the two things he’s describing here are the same thing :kek: idk if he just has a hurt ego or what but he just doesn’t like that majority of Choices trailers always have a genderlocked female MC loving a male LI rather than the other way around this is his facebook profile btw. it’s the self inserting for me. just admit it, you’re Ina’s wife. own it ;) it comes down to the fact that QB MC is female genderlocked but this guy says he's Ina's husband anyway. its a little self-inserty to me but idk maybe thats just me its nice to see straight men NOT fetishizing lesbianism for once even so, its eh apparently only men are allowed to chase after them lmao lmao whenever the genderlocked topic comes up there's always someone who's like "Most other videogames have male protagonists anyways go play them!!!" But like how many have LGBTQ protagonists that are male? not many. I get that most of the audience is female but besides the art for Male MCs and some changed pronouns, the characters barely refer to your gender so I'm not sure why its vital to have one gender. all that aside, would love to see more covers like Foreign Affairs at the very least yeah. a male genderlocked book is never going to happen because in the plotlines i can imagine where it has to be male genderlocked PB’ll probably be attacked for promoting male privilege the only way they’d be able to gain a profit from a male genderlocked book was if they fetishized and milked an mlm romance IMHO (not that I agree with the means of it) yo, MOTY deserved a spin-off. wouldve loved to see a FOTY book why do you always have the perfect video clips :kek: oh my, did someone touch a nerve? :worrysip: https://tenor.com/view/perhaps-perhaps-cow-cow-gif-24051768 .cowsay Man I remember when i had hair like that. i was hot, smoking, and working it did i? barely remembered the book lmao got it from a tv show but eh they don’t call him Benedict ||***Cum***berbatch|| for nothing ;) :dogelick: ready to get bonked and love it damn right :dogewink: https://tenor.com/view/bonkers-bonk-meme-bonk-dog-bonk-hub-bonk-gif-23661548 :megadrian: :megadrian: :megadrian: it’s how i roll bby ✨ nah ✨ ~~mayhaps~~ :dogelick: :heheadrian: anyone got pics? ah the good old days :BooParty: agreed tbh o_O because its TNA :KEKWhands: Voltra, remember the Lily's Garden ads we used to laugh at so much? :kek: now im thinking of those lmao this one also will always be iconic :kek: wait, you also customize a building in WTD? a bit spoiler-y but i dont even mind at this point lol and then i remembered what this channel is :sadclown: yeeting my ass back into #📵no-spoiler-zone :deargodhelp: yikes cringe well she's very into lesbian erasure. anything after that, doesnt surprise me she doing this just to pander lmao yeah there are transphobic gays and biphobic gays as well, which is super weird desperately yup ._. like seriously, guys and girls can be JUST friends. is that so hard to grasp with Ines and Zaid? they're best friends, that doesnt always give them romantic potential lol ig truly 9 because dead/sleeping none same old things rehashed from the previous month and it’s like Mara said. with VIP early access now becoming more common, what’s even the point trapped in prison with Guy Ledford eww its official, my new birthday is July 14 :garbryce: either that or July 21 :) i'd be down for July 5 too ngl NOW THATS A CURVEBALL Endless Twerking periodt who wouldnt want a summer wedding :) hmm winter is my favorite season after all. watch me wear three layers into a cheesy Vegas chapel LMAO WHY IS THAT TRUE AME wedding was summer, ES handfasting was summer, ROE wedding was summer oh yeah true TC&TF doesnt really have any seasonal changes lol yeah autumn wedding if ILITW was slice-of-life and not of the horror genre whatsoever 😂 yo they finally featured BOLAS in an ad :dogeheart: another one “Yes Ash, harder!”
*in the presence of infants* yikes SB and BOLAS 2 😭 agreed lol thank god for iphone features that let you change an app’s icon by turning it into a shortcut 😆 did you try using the Shortcuts app? i fiddled around with the buttons and stuff until i somehow stumbled into changing the app icon and getting to rename the shortcut lol ooh found the instructions https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/iphone-13-is-coming-soon-but-you-can-still-make-your-current-iphone-home-screen-aesthetic/?fbclid=IwAR06f-AKqZY023iEyPYOYCXRdKLYBIQI9c6DSOCiEhaMz85-YKhgLDKA0BM TC&TF, im good with that 👌🏼 queen shit 👀 uncultured beautiful y’all are sleeping on Michael with his Vans and it shows 😔😔 lmao even the comments are confusion :KEK: the frat bro from VOS and Chadley now that’d be some juice goose :KEK: no satisfaction on both ends yeah BSC .img BSC2 .img untameable sneak peek i mean that was obvious hoo-wee, BSC getting a spin-off after all LOL i hated those faces valid :KEK: you're not wrong. i simp for the French colonizer uwu now my ancestors are disappointed in me, even more so than usual :KEKWhands: no choice but to stan pain LMAO i just use it to express internal pain xD :KEK: they do be looking pretty tho, damn holy moly, that ballroom and courtyard not me thinking the stairs was part of the wallpaper 💀 IT LOOKS SO FLAT sweet, broody elf boi 👀 these are just edits oh wait i could be wrong lmao yes i’m definitely wrong :KEK: i just never paid diamonds for these scenes :KEKWhands: :KEKWhands: Sofia supremacy poly is also an option lol but ofc it’s The Nanny Affair, no plural lmao nope it’s a single LI story if it’s a single LI story, MC is definitely not gonna be single lol which is funny too because realistically most affairs are eventually discovered and concluded rarely in fiction does it ever “blossom into romance” idk maybe i’m just limited on the multimedia i watch xd hmm my mistake again happy V-Day everyone 😂 ~~shadow monster boyfriend when~~ gaslight gatekeep girlboss TNA should’ve let you choose which of the coupled pair to have the affair with that would’ve been interesting to see that too lmao from that point on, hooking up in a public restroom is hot for PB watch them portray ||gloryholes|| they announced they were gonna do an all-black cast book during the height of the BLM movement in 2020. and we finally got a title name gonna be interesting to see LMAO oh god the way people have claimed this book isn’t diverse because it’s all black cast :worry: yup i know for sure this could be Chelsa’s and like half of QB’s writing team’s next big project so there’s hope in that area it just makes sense for Chelsa and colleagues to be writing this one If it's a reasonable genderlock , I won't mind it hey for the purpose of cultural accuracy, im down for a racelocked MC since it’s the entire purpose ROE MC at least has some form of knowledge to her Filipino-Chinese background and it’d be nice to see something else similar to that whoops lemme edit that. used the term wrong yes just without vampires lol ooh maybe a fountain of youth could be involved those were hot TH:M male faces 😩😩 yes yup, did a lil announcement a while back about accessing their server binaries https://twitter.com/PlayChoices/status/1252307326393937920?s=09 like way back in 2020 lmao 4/20 seems like it tbh then again who knows there's a shock oh damn i impulse buy new earbuds whenever i completely wreck my old pair lmao 👀 iOS devices let you do that. idk about Android users tho. they probably have their own program it actually does through Shortcuts lol :) thank you :D all thanks to this i still technically have to look at the original icon every time i access the shortcut itself but it’s whatever, i can just swipe it away instantly besides pretty sure Mara uses an Android device anyway oh wait really? :KEK: i really lob in all mod users as Android users :KEKWhands: sounds very Murder Mystery Party so i’m excited oooo 👀 :MunchlaxMunch: damn next month gonna be exciting. COP and Untameable with the wide releases lol fr gonna be a high school reunion, i feel lol it’s not just gonna be embezzlement being added to the list of crimes portrayed in Choices wanna bet there’s a hallway pursuit with the Benny Hill theme playing students gonna be in much more mature situations damn nothing ever happens in this quiet coastal town of Cedar Cove, until the body is found… quack ooh cute Appa supremacy :dogeheart: you know what, same lol yes the Fae realm Ahmed, is your wifi/discord okay?

Shrapnel before he got his powers his literal identity is Lead Gunman LMAO Bouldermort genius yeah that was the default :KEKWhands: AME counts with Slater and Bianca RCD with Thomas TC&TF with Diavolos TF with Zig and Becca :KEKWhands: yeah i’d say so majority of older books got sequels, almost always guaranteed until time passed it just varied it would have to depend on the book’s success likelihood
