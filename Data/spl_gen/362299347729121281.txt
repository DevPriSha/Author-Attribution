Thanks for doing this so much. You've made my heart happy Wait what roles can be requested Uh can I get a he/him and 18+ chat please? Extra fries Thank you Ketchup I'd prefer them to be specific Because everytime you say you're LGBT people think you're gay and I already have to deal with people irl assuming I'm into men and that I'm gonna have a husband If you saw my message in the server with Rei you'd understand I am transgender My Dad actually told me my body was "made for a man" was the sum of the message It includes bi people What No Nonono Gay and lesbian is already inclusive Trans women can be lesbians WLW is a catchall for bi and lesbian We could have WLW, MLM, NBLNB, transgender, nonbinary, and aro/ace That's not a lot Yes Wait That's just a pronoun role It'd be better to give them a nonbinary role I'm in 5 Choices servers 4 after the old spoilerland gets deleted I'm very happy You guys even went and used the same channel names I'm soft I love it After reading through Dsicord suggestions, I would like to set a reminder to please please god do not change my nickname when it's your birthday there's few places I get called Adam Show us ! Oh it looks AMAZING What kind of icing did you use? It looks like something with a mirror coat Oooh that's what I was thinking If it makes you feel any better my old chemistry teacher called me by the name of an allergy medication when I was a TA in the library PRI YOU'RE BACK I'M OK ARE YOU OK Will we have the 3 chapters when it comes back or just the one? Oh I meant when it comes back the 21st will there be 3 released or just one? :dogeheart: I would like...a horror HFTH Not HFTH like In that style I mean Also mystery book come out on Halloween maybe? 👀 Please PB As someone that went through a massive hurricane that left him without electricity or water or any sort of signal, if there's no outhouse then they probably used a bucket. I don't think pirates shower that much but I'm gonna assume they rinsed off in the ocean like my parents did I'm ok guys it was 2 years ago!! The whole thing just gave me some experience to what it might have been like for MC in DS Maybe? I think it'd be cute to get a MOTY Christmas book, and sensible to think it's possible A book 2 though? Idk about that Pri left again :wut: No, you only see it if your date is Zoey All of my naps are 2 to 4 hours wym What is CS? Ooooh I had a dream about Bachelorette Party...which is really strange considering I've never read it I've seen the hair styles for the book and my dream had like 5 proper black hairstyles which means PB really needs to catch up and stop giving us basic straight hair I don't look at the book club posts What was it about Is the 6 hour slowmode how long the polls are open for Sorry if I'm late but a new Choices update is out! Hopefully this means everything is fixed! Wat I'm testing it now IT'S WORKING!!! A while ago I asked about bringing back the asset channel, but nothing came of it, so I was wondering where I could put a huge thing that I found? Uhhh It's just a huge number of backgrounds Like giant From I think every book I found it when I was searching for Sims 4 accuracy For covid? How did it go What are you majoring? Also Can I just put it in general since I can't really separate it I can, but it's just a really long link. I can DM it to you if you like to be more specific So I can post it there? Maybe it'll be a lil like WT We'll see that guy again There's political stuff in it tho is what I mean Me? So what faces do you think they'll use? For the mystery book I'm hoping VOS MC is the VP having an affair with the guy running for president I don't think they'd go there My god sorry it someone already brought this up but I just saw something pn the subreddit about this new politcis book and Remember that one Choices Insider survery? About would you rather naviagte politics, be stuck on an island, or work on a cooking show? *They listened* I picked politics and mermaids too! I'm still disappointed that we didn't get a mermaid book when PB announced DS as the "nautical book" I liked DS tho I didn't pick the cooking show one in the survery because it said the chef was hot headed and I can't deal with another Justin situation I would love a cooking book though. We haven't had anything even remotely close to that Let me date a cute pastry chef PB 😡 The closest we got to a "forced" female LI was Eleanor Also yeah I was thinking of a woman when I said "cute pastry chef". I would love someone that shared my love of baking desserts 👀 I used to bake all the time but I fell out if it the past few months :Dopeysad: I made a red velvet cake recently tho (albeit from a box but) and it sucked because it wasn't *true* red velvet cake, just vanilla with red food coloring 😡 I want to experiment with using ganache soon but I worry I won't be able to make it shiny Yeah I remember that cake!! It looks so good Screenshotting this My next project is muffins Although that's not technically a dessert - I just like muffins Yeah I loved going through the results I just wish I could remember which faces they showed for "face I face II face III" Also those results weren't surprising with what I've seen on the subreddit If you see anyone simping for Jen in the favorite LI category it's probably me Finally a fellow Jen stan!! What was that one girl that we stan...who high school English teachers all say was a spinster but really she was just a lesbian Emily Dickens? Dickenson? She wrote love letters to this one woman from what I can remember Yeah her name was Susan Hey guys I think tomorrow is the one month anniversary of this server! Wait that was yesterday Time is really flying by Yes I thought today was the 3rd 😭 But yeah yesterday was our anniversary! Hey if I download the mod on my current phone will all my progress be lost? Is it possible to go back and forth with the mod One account play with the mod and one without Using the same phone How do I completely delete the mod Because the phone I used for it isn't supported my Choices anymore, which means I can't update, and with the mod you get an inescapable update message. I want to finish the diamond playthrough I started and have enough to do it Tried deleting everything I could. But the mod is still locked in and I can't escape the update message I can't. I can't access the app to even save my progress. And I can't delete the app because I won't be able to redownload it because it's not available on that phone version anymore Well I didn't have a Facebook account So I was using my Mom's...on my unmodded version, which is my main I only use the mod for replays Also I was paranoid And it was before you could sign in with Google I'd download it on my current phone but I don't trust it enough for something to not go wrong and corrupt me I do not I don't even know how to do that It took me like an hour just to figure out the APK No I have a computer I wanna just download it on my current phone but I'm paranoid I have 2 phones Mara One I use for the mod Which doesn't even matter anyway because I can't get the mod to fucking work on this phone Bro I'm stressed at the phone because I have the right to be not at y'all don't spray me If I wasn't frustrated before I kind of am now I fully agree with the spray bottle statement. I've had it used on me unnecessarily MORE THAN ONCE and it's really humiliating and uncalled for Sorry I had a nap I just woke up I wasn't getting paranoid, I said I was paranoid about the mod corrupting my current phone, which is why I put it on my old phone in the first place I was answering a question? Also it's humiliating because the only time it's been used on me was in an unnecessary way or to downplay my feelings and it's not great And I was fine. I was never angry, especially when I mentioned the outfit comment in TRH. It feels like you're misinterpreting my comments as aggressive Update: Galaxy s8 I've tried it 5 times and kept getting that message I did that when Priy and I talked in DMs, it didn't work And then at some point I got a massive ad for Viagra without even having any apps open so I went into safe mode and deleted everything related to the mod Yeah I've only been using AndroPalace I did the same thing I did when I first installed in on my old phone But...still nothing I only used the basic link and mediafire from the mirror mod I'm so bored y'all all I want is to finish my diamond playthrough of ROE :ohgodohduck: Discord doesn't work unless I turn my wifi off I've had enough :dead: Yeah ik it's not me because all my other apps have been ok Has anyone else at some point stopped getting the Lily Gardens or Homescapes ads and instead began to get weight loss and prescription drug ads @Deleted User Super late but I haven't searched anything related to weight loss or dieting in like years so it can't be targeted It's a little 😬 for me to get weight loss ads considering my past Has anyone notcied that when it comes to ILB faces, they keep using the Hispanic one for new books but the black and Asian faces haven't been used yet? With the OH faces they used every one .-. White in PT, Asian in MOTY and BP, Hispanic in BaBu, black in OH itself... No fuck off Oh yeah white in SK and DS too I forgot they existed They already do ? If I see that bun one more time instead of a decent black hairstyle I am going to go feral I think he means what link from Andro Palace Like MediaFire You can get in trouble there for "badmouthing" that server in another server It happened to me when I said I didn't like their April Fool's Day prank They were like super rude about it and yelled at me for "shit talking" them in another server Oh wait I forgot I also got in trouble because it was Drew that happened to reply to me :kek: What is this a reference to? ^^ Yeah they said that in the beginning Even though it took forever and I started to think they lied to us God this threw me in a loop before I saw it was the glitch again I need flash player recommendations because I can't do shit now since Adobe decided to axe theirs Nah I need it to watch movies Yeah everything that used Flash isn't working anymore for me Ever since today That's an alternative I can use? Can someone link me a computer emulator that's completely safe? Ever since Choices stopped supporting my old phone I've been missing replaying books with the mod That's a valid concern. I see it a lot with face claims in particular Help (It's the APK) Idk why I only have ever had trouble installing it on this phone LMAO No :Dopeysad: Didn't work I don't understand, before I needed the app installed? I'm signed in with Google, will my non mod data be ok? Oh no I mean I'm worried about losing my current non mod save when I uninstall the mod later and go back to normal I was doing a diamond replay of ROE on my old phone, but then PB decided to stop supporting it so I never got to finish IT INSTALLED OH MY GOD I CAN FINISH MY PLAYTHROUGH @8emi95 THANK YOU SO MUCH I got the mod to install!!! Thank you Now I just need to get back to where I was in book 3 :killme: I'll be out of the loop on the current releasing books for a few days I used the mediafire link And no, no VIP I got the mediafire one from Andropalace, so when I open the app it says "A n d r o p a l a c e" at the bottom None of the mods have VIP There's 3 links Straight up mod
VIP
Links to other mods Try uninstalling it completely I'm actually looking forward to WEH, I heard it's really good and they were supposed to release it a year ago Yeah I know how it ends but I still wanna play it Oh no I wasn't implying you were I like how they gave corgi one too Ok new headcannon We have to go on a secret mission somewhere and wear disguises and the corgi comes and wears the mustache Sorry idk the royal corgi I just know Baguette the French corgi :dogewink: "A corgi?"
*puts on mustache*
"BAGUETTE THE CORGI?!" I love kitties Can we have a picture of her? So Y'all have any tattoos? What is it? Ooooh I have my oldest dog's pawprint on my ankle She's 15 years old Yeah I want more too What do you think you'll get? Oh If it's your first I recommend somewhere not bony My Mom has both of hers tatted I think I want something Marvel related above my knee for my next one Thigh, upper arm I got mine just above my ankle bone and it HURT Regrets But also glad I didn't get it any lower I'd say so, but not if you're super skinny I think Also one note White ink hurts more than any other color Upper arm is a good place!! I think a lot of people do that or forearm for their first Mine was mostly dot work but when I had coloring in it hurt I think black is least pain, white is most. Idk why it's that way, though Yeah I got yellow bordering red area for my first 😬 Referencing the picture My tattoo is black Yeah that too!! If anyone knows why white ink hurts most lmk It also depends on size. Mine was mostly dot work but I only went once She's not even a LI :ohgodohduck: Did anyone else's challenges reset? "Make a premium choice" I completed that ages ago and it disappeared Man I was so close to the 150 days played and getting a massive diamond reward :Dopeysad: I wouldn't say it's the shittiest version as the challenges DID get me rich I think some of their "most popular books that people hate" are only that popular because people diamond mine but they don't want to admit that They dragged us longer than MTFL MC As they should after being dragged for years I actually left a comment about it on their Instagram, which is something I have never done before To be completely honest with you all...I don't think ROD was ever going to get a second book, or was meant to have one in the first place. I think fans begged for it so much they were like "yeah sure whatever" in an attempt to quiet them Also tbh I hate that they said that shit about hated books like...they got so many views because of diamond miners LMAO I propose that to diamond mine in the future maybe we should just...replay books we like and get the ads They dragged this out for 4 years and it's despicable I hated FB moms even before I played Choices and yet here I am liking them even less- What I don't understand is what they're saving money for. If they're making books like BaBu to get money for books like BOLAS...but then don't make books like BOLAS...then what is all the money for? Exactly I want closure If I could choose any book, it'd be Hero. The cliffhanger was so giant If the script was a lie...Maybe they can just go back and rewrite the ending of book 1 #GiveEvaALastName2021 I actually think they're hiring rn What are they? Yeah the Hero cliffhanger was fucking insane Jesus christ God that reminds me of this one thing I saw This company wanted like 5 years experience of this Microsoft program that had only been out for like 2 years or something like that When was it confirmed? Eva. Like how it's spelled Ayva would be Ava Perfect Idk what WFHing is Ah I am unemployed That's because they're conservatives I'm also 90% sure that's why Andrew conveniently took a break from Twitter before the announcement Of what Spoilerland? Do we have any MCs with green eyes besides white D&D MC? I can't think of any Orcs, aliens, and elves don't count SA? Sorry I forgot to turn off the @ Someone in the Instagram comments said something about wanting a vet book and I can't decide if I'm on board because yes or not on board because I can't stand animals being hurt/sad I ordered Pizza Hut for dinner TF book 1 has the most views on the whole app When views were still visible Annabelle from D&D? We actually see Sabina's dad in a flashback and he's a massive dick Is the newest bs Android update still making it impossible to download/play Choices? I've pushed it back like 5 times now Oh my god I thought it was only me Whenever I go to a channel and click on the videos tab I get NOTHING I got it to work!! I had to (begrudgingly 🙄) close out all of my tabs so Chrome could restart That makes it sound like I had 50 open but really it was only about 10 This is so valid Happy birthday we love you 🎂 Remember when we had a new chapter releasing almost every day, each for a different book 😔🤘🏻 Why are they putting some of the merch "in the vault"? What is the purpose? Losing sales? But why? Omg remember when people would sell iPhones with it installed for crazy $$$ After it was taken away Ok this might sound stupid but someone said good morning in another server and it got me thinking how cool time zones are and just how vast the planet is, yet how small we are yet how beautiful it is. I just got out of the shower and I'm laying in bed in my pajamas but somebody else on this same planet is waking up to a beautiful Tuesday morning and is about to eat breakfast. That's so amazing. It's wild Hey 3 out of 4 of the ones I voted for won!! 🥳 Why did I think of ILITW What's the context of this? Oh that's good Mara. Imagine what would happen if she got the job and released all the scripts and stuff. No surprises, lots of pressure Ik we're in the spoiler server so by surprises I mean new books PB might lose a lot of money It scares me honestly. Imagining what will happen to PB if she gets the job and doesn't change The original doge is actually a girl! Her name is Kabosu I still have ROD My preveiws Yes I do Look at how they massacred my girl Stage lights are not sunlight There's actually a little fact I know about the mirror thing. Take it with a grain of salt Apparently when the mirror thing came to be related to vampires, mirrors were made with silver And now they are not, so unless the mirror is very old, they could possibly see themselves You know how people were with the whole silver thing being used against mythical creatures Oooooh that's neat Praying for VOS faces. It'd make sense Teja is Indian? I don't know every name origin Lately every time I get the slightest bit hot I get the urge to cut all my hair off But it's conflicting Because I've never had hair I couldn't pull back and my curls are the one thing I've always loved about myself. Plus my parents would flip out It's above my shoulders but can still be pulled back Wait why is Naomi there? Also ik a lot of people hate Kaitlyn for some reason on the sub but she's the OG and my favorite I think But I can't ignore all the others I set my MC up with :dogeheart: Yeah but all the others are from genderlocked books Because of the band stuff is what I saw All the LIs during freshman year were irritating tbh Not fair to signal out her imo Oh no Voltra I was talking about the sub!! No one here is Unpopular but new James face > old James face That's true Fae but I have seen people actually defend Justin And plenty of love for Drake The sub hates Lily and Kaitlyn Lily did nothing wrong ever The new Discord icon is a different color 🤢 I don't understand the point in retiring things like this. All it does is disappoint people I am so fucking tired of Project Makeover ads Someone tell me why I just got a CYOA ad where this girl gets together with her stepfather and they have a kid together :judgeyfroge: It was called "Romance Fate" I thought it was Chapters at first Make sure what you have as an excuse is solid. Skipping jury duty could land you in jail Hey is "based" a good thing I'm...old I still think of "thank you based god" from when I was a teen So I always thought it was that making a comeback *this generation* I always divide by culture No way people born before 2000 are gen z We're very different I feel very..."get off my lawn" rn honestly My brother is graduating high school Wednesday I can't fucking believe he's gotten so old It's so strange Swear he was just 16 "What do you mean he's getting older. That doesn't happen" Feel bad he only had one normal year of high school Sophomore year he was out for months because of hurricane Michael Then junior and senior year corona happened I look 10 years younger than him tho My Discord logo finally changed color and I absolutely hate it. Disgusting. Hard on the eyes. Go to hell :judgeyfroge: Oh man!!! OH MAN!!! INSIDERS HYPE Wake The Dead isn't a romance title... It's GOC... New book!!!! Idc what y'all think I'm excited Is it bad that's I'm a little excited for OH to end so I can start my next diamond playthrough God the fact there's only one book in ongoing...I thought I had accidentally hid the section Anyone else just...chug a bottle of water when you get out of the shower My showers aren't even that hot but when I get out I chug a small bottle of cold water and it hits different Last time I looked that name up it was Ash-lynn? It's Irish so it's not pronounced how it looks Does the person speaking have an Irish accent? :kek: I bet it's like 50 now :Dopeyangry: What is going on :wut: Since PB loves her so much, I think she should use her voice about all the issues going on with the books. Maybe they'll listen to her That makes it sound like they're paying her to play their games Or they have a contract where she's not allowed to say anything negative Contracts where you can't criticize are sketch It was 93F earlier today I hate Florida bro Can't wait until July when it's 102 🤪 That's 33.8 and 38.8 Celsius Here it's always at LEAST 3 to 4 degrees warmer than the listed temp (ie. "80 but feels like 84") because of the high humidity I consider the "feels like" the more accurate temperature Honestly being a ginger I'm about 4 shades paler than the rest of my family (plus I'm heat sensitive) so I rarely leave the house during Summer But my Mom is fucking bonkers and would probably keep the thermostat at 79/80 year round if we let her 80 is 26.6 My room is the hottest in the whole house I swear to god Yes. But my Mom keeps the temp at 77 (25) How y'all doin I just took the nicest shower. I feel clean as FUCK Has anyone in here had the Pfizer vaccine? How did you feel after the second dose? My bsf is worried about getting a reaction as bad as mine, but I got Moderna I feel bad because I think I scared him with how bad my reaction was, I could barely walk He's getting it tomorrow Yeah, I told him Tylenol was my saving grace. I'll let him know, thank you guys PB give Scott the recognition he deserves challenge Update: Best friend got his 2nd shot!! Did they get a callout or something Oh my god so I was right? :KEKWhands: Holy fuck they did they doxxed the artist Twitter is fucking scary The name "Surrender" has definitely gotten my interest 👀 Yes I know I'm super late I slept most of the day God the schedule is so dry, I'm considering starting BP just to have something to read besides TNA :PleasePBJustStop: Oh also I should have clarified I don't have VIP and I'm waiting for AVSP to fully release before reading Me, still using iTunes: :judgeyfroge: How do you fry a liquid I wonder if its a pain in the ass to clean Like it sticks to the sides Cleaning a fryer is already tedious Hey guys is oldgamesdownload.com reliable or is it a scam? Uhh This game I played when I was like 6 or 7 Old PC game Oooh shit they have the Sims 2 also might fuck around and attempt that Hey guys I wanted to let anyone that cares know that I might lose cell signal tomorrow...maybe I'm just traumatized by hurricane Michael still but the way my parents are talking about the storm tomorrow is making me nervous so if I am gone from the server for several days that's why Well not gone just inactive I don't think it'll be a full on hurricane but the way my parents are talking and my Mom saying "I don't *think* we'll lose water" are making me like, super nervous I'm in Florida so that's probably it...whenever I opened Pokémon Go today I got a severe weather warning, though we only got rain today Yeah. Hurricane Michael was a category 5 and a major event in my life So I'm nervous No it's ok I'll update you tomorrow Thank you Schools closed which is a positive thing...every time they've closed schools as long as I lived here, it ended up being fine weather Thank you all, I love you I hope I'm just overreacting...but with Michael it was a category 3 and then changed at the last minute And then BOOM Disaster in my city An update: Since I'm on meds that make me sleepy I decided to take a 4 hour nap as opposed to being very anxious all day. Don't know what's happened in that time but being awake the lights have been flickering bad and the outside almost sounds like Michael Thank you Kio I think it hasn't rained in an hour now, but if it starts again it'll definitely be later tonight Parts of my city are out of power though, but luckily not me Y'all remember the no more tears fish bottle How do I do the image command WHAT LMAO ,img no more tears shampoo THAT ONE What kind of scent is cherry almond Someone make that a trigger In this server we stan Betty White :UmiYay: What kind of furry emote is this :judgeyfroge: :judgeyfroge: Not to be off topic but I just realized since they put in "threads" I can't search for certain words anymore :PleasePBJustStop: Oh my god I was using the one at the bottom When you swipe to the server list I'm a millennial that's not technologically advanced Insert the Marge emoji from the other server Yes that one Anytime an app changes layout I'm like "where da fock did everything go" Yeah I can hardly read the black text Not to butt in but I think they would have more money if they stopped going back and editing TRR book 1 It was perfect as it was, as wonderful as the CGs are, we didn't *need* them Holy shit? Which book was that Oh yeah I was wracking my brain like :wut: :ohgodohduck: Hey if you're looking to expand your Sims game and are short on money Drew, I recommend the stuff packs tiny living or bowling night. I love the tiny living clothes and who doesn't love bowling? When I got on yesterday they were on sale for 25% off Laundry day is great too if you like that stuff Stuff packs are the cheapest packs before kits, which...are $5 but don't give you much 🤔 Lol "Love" PB you still have time to fix this shit Hilarious that all the replies defending PB are either VIP members, people talking about romance for some reason (irrelevant to this situation), or both Mainly VIP members who don't give a fuck about anyone else Really, I think I can sum this up in 3 words: Yeah that's what I'm pissed about They basically lied to us So there's this Animal Crossing app I use to keep track of my stuff, and the creator hasn't updated in months. Normally they haven't been later than a few weeks. I'm worried honestly Where is everyone? Ew...math Honestly I haven't been to college. Which I get shit for. But one of my biggest things is that you're *required* to take classes that are essentially repeats of 11th and 12th grade I am no good at math, and if I fail I feel like I'll have wasted my money You know I actually heard somewhere that 11th and 12th grade were added during some war to keep teens from being drafted or something, so that's why college is a repeat I really just want to take an anthropology class without being forced to learn calculus I think they're kinda neat Plus they're useful when people tell you you're adopted just because your hair color is different than your parents I wouldn't say I'd do them for fun Honestly I don't remember much of 9th grade biology It was really boring. Just...plant cells for most of the year Do not care about plant cells Hope this doesn't make me sound like a freak but dissecting a sheep heart was...neat I love the relationship between Connor and Hank. Very father/son. It weirds me out when people ship them I would die for Sumo God I love dogs so much Don't remember the polar bear. It's been a while OH Wth is going on with iPhones? This is like the 4th security breach No I know what happened it just seems to happen a lot :CharmanderHi: Aw I didn't get to see it :( I didn't know who Brett Kavanaugh whatever was until the trial Well it still applies Now everyone knows who he is Don't remind me He was only in Home Alone 2 because they filmed in a building he owns and he demanded to be in the movie Nicki's a republican? It's what he deserves :PBSeeIToldYouSo: I've heard anti vax shit from both parties tbh Right side is all "government tracking" and left side is all "essential oils" But yeah anti vax doesn't mean republican at this point Who The only valid Tucker is the one from Danny Phantom I barely remember HSS Surprisingly my republican parents are trying to convince my annoying ass younger brother to get the vaccine. Literally the only one in the house that hasn't gotten it :PleasePBJustStop: Oh no what did that guy do Guys what did he do There's a Belvoire Twitter page? Not in the RP server Hey Priy Love seeing the iconic Bernie Sanders in the Queen B throne again Thank you Bel The rest *nose whistle plays* Wait LMAO YOUR NEW TAG "Big bully- Bui" My worst comment is when I made a post asking about relationships in TF and told a commentor I wasn't going after Zig :PleasePBJustStop: Hey mine too :Dopeyhappy: I think you can sort by controversial on your profile so try that Is this a fan group for CYOA or an app stealing PB's art? I don't have Facebook, this was an ad on Instagram Is it Choices art? It looks very similar Yeah I was gonna say it looks like different color BB hair I see it too Oh man that reminds me of my god awful 8th grade English teacher. Truly a menace to everyone that had her :PleasePBJustStop: WHAT Oh man what was the scandal at y'all's high school? How tf do you OD on weed Mine is the drama teacher getting a student pregnant and getting fired because of it. (She was 18 but still) I know Jesus christ Weed smells so bad I can't imagine My neighbor is a pothead :PleasePBJustStop: Not the one that owns the cat I posted in #🤳show-yourself  dw Why would you waste money like that OH MY GOD HOW COULD I FORGET You go first Eat the rich Teenagers scare me because they drink vodka in class at 7 AM But When I was a sophomore (that's 15 turning 16 for y'all non Americans) this guy in my year threatened to ||shoot up the school||, it was some sick dark humor "joke" and he threw flyers about it on the ground in the cafeteria and posted ||bullets|| to his Snapchat. He was arrested and expelled from school. Haven't seen anything of him since I understand your fear. I didn't even know about it until I heard his friends talking after his arrest I didn't eat in the cafeteria Too crowded and overwhelming Outdoor campus gang That happened to me too omg What the hell What do you mean by enclosed I'm sorry There was a cafeteria and a courtyard next too it Yeah the cafeteria was all closed but it had outdoor seating. The courtyard just happened to be next to it What ages is secondary school High school here is 14 to 18 What the actual fuck So Did y'all ever play Webkinz? Do you remember your first one? I was 8, and I got a panda and named her Banana The website is still up. Which is amazing considering this website I LOVED as a preteen/teen, Petpet Park, shut down Oh I've seen that it's such a good video Loving the new icon guys!! The new Twitter formate is so ugly 🤮 Why do apps keep changing this nobody asked to be changed They made everything super wide for no reason Maybe it was backed up It's basically kind of like a Snapchat avatar Oooh bitmoji Here's mine Discord stop trying to get me to join student hubs when I'm not in college challenge I vowed to never use Grammarly purely because they pop up a lot in YT ads Are y'all today's date? Because you're 10/10 Hey what would you put in a gift box/care package for a guy that's not food, soap, or beard care related? I've been browsing Etsy for ideas and that's...kind of all there is I know it's early but I was thinking about doing care boxes for Christmas for my family this year and I have no idea what to put in my Dad or brother's That's a good idea... My Dad would probably like axe throwing I know a place I could probably just put anime stuff and M&Ms in my brother's and he would love it lol Nah nvm that's too little effort he deserves better "Adam it's 3AM in October why are you thinking about Christmas" ssshhhhh Actually Amazon already has the gift guides out I don't know but Lush took away the Halloween section and replaced it with Christmas :KEKWhands: I was falling asleep and my eyes snapped open because I just realized Pixelberry, we call PB for short And their logo is a berry...which is used to make jam... PB&J... 🍞 🥜 🍓 Ok so y'all know how when it comes to customizable LIs usually it's black, white, and either Hispanic or Asian? Never both? Well apparently it's not just a PB thing We got this Amazon toy catalog in the mail and I looked through it to see what ~kids these days~ are into and when I got to the doll section the same thing was going on What the hell Also appreciate that my PB&J was iconic enough that I'm seeing people use it :dogeheart: Idk about Asian but certain places in the South have a large Hispanic population because we're near the Mexico border. Some places even have Spanish used at basically the same rate English is Well not just the Mexico border but Puerto Rico and Cuba too Using what you said...there were more Hispanic than Asian dolls I still think it's stupid So y'all have lighter skinned dolls?

But ig flooding doesn't really apply since my house is too high up We only had flooding after hurricane roof damage Michael :PleasePBJustStop: I don't think tornados count because I feel like they can happen anywhere there's a storm Bro you good?

So much meme potential God can you imagine Also hey y'all What the fuck was that I still don't understand NFTs or how they can hurt the environment if they're digital I want to ask a question but you have to promise not to make fun of me Bel jesus christ That's me on Instagram it's ok But um How does electricity make greenhouse gas? It's not made in a factory Wait yo I missed the extra zero - Why does electricity need steam It's just Zip zap Through wires I don't know how I thought electricity was made but that's definitely not it Texas is the worst state What do you mean by robust It depends where in the US tbh Ew republicans :ethonk: I don't really see buses that often when I go out. Unless they're school buses We have train tracks here but they're cargo, never transport for people There's one I hear blowing their horn in the distance at 3 AM That's because Japan is next level Far superior to the US in tech That's because the society would completely fall apart without them My main thing has always been the EXTREMELY long flight I literally cry from exhaustion after 8 hour road trips Nah it's definitely about destination fuck long trips I'm tired and want to lay in bed away from people :PleasePBJustStop: Also I am scared of boats because titanic and am scared to fly again since finding out about 9/11 Kio what is this :judgeyfroge: Small boats are ok. It's big travel boats that make me paranoid I actually can't swim despite living in Florida I mean I used to know when I was little. But I went so long without swimming I forgot Oh tea? How are you all today Just want to warn you all (at least in the US) to do any online Christmas shopping now because shipping is still having issues because of corona Love you Hey I'm 99% sure they did it purely so nobody can see the massive amount of dislikes this year's rewind will have LMAO Where is our dude There is a MegaMind filter on my Snapchat Pwease tell me what it's called This is my biggest problem about it. I don't care about seeing the ratio on other videos as much (like vlogs/meme stuff) but the dislikes are SO important for stuff like this Yes We're like the little angel and demon on your shoulder Guys once December hits can we change the roles to festive themed Like snowflakes and presents Idk Gingerbread is good for orange Maybe Santa for red? God eggnog sounds gross but yeah I always imagine it like drinking eggs I would say tree for green but I feel that's not inclusive I'm just trying to think of color matches tbh I can only think of Satns for red Gingerbread is orange I feel that'll be difficult Gingerbread It's not religious it's just food So? No evergreen tree is that shade of green Idk I don't think carrot cake and Winter have any association Mistletoe is better I like that Anyone orange is evil Anything but eggnog NO Is there anything red in Hannukah Ok guys mistletoe or Grinch I'm still adamant on orange being gingerbread. It's the most Wintery/festive choice we've had so far Mara what do you think New role names For the holiday season How do I do that I don't think we'll settle tbh :PleasePBJustStop: I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING FOR RED :pomg: LOL I thought that too after I sent it We love you Mara Do u guys like my red suggestion I will admit I only thought of the berries because of Animal Crossing :raifepain: I can't believe it's almost December I hope 2022 is a year that treats you all well.

What is the worst birthday gift you've got? Mine is a common December baby experience: Something Christmas related. I got ornaments Oh that's a fat mood :sadhours: McDonald's has chicken tenders? What :KEKWhands: Rn I want ice cream I actually haven't eaten non breakfast McDonald's in over a decade FOR A GOOD REASON TOO 😡😡😡 Lu have u never had a little cup of ice cream at Applebee's Cinnamon candy is a sin I've never had Taco Bell POPCORN? Applebee's has popcorn????? Where do you live No way that's a yankee thing Throwback to when Arby's had to add (for sandwiches) to their commercials for like 6 months Sonic cherry limeade hits All of you need cherry limeades rn :cooldown: Wendy's god tier. Not breakfast though because they don't have pancakes and all of the sandwiches have eggs 🤢 Eggs are DISGUSTAN The hot cakes >>>>>>> Hashbrowns are so good Horrific Chicken minis I'm tired of Pizza Hut trying to get me to buy Cinnabon dessert Leave me alone I love candy And those videos of putting candy in a dish Man I had a place like that. It was a small business, real local feel. But after Michael, they couldn't afford the 1 million to repair it because they didn't own the building Miss those fucking puffy ass breadsticks Obviously My best friend used to work there and I would like to pass the message that EVERYONE working the line fucking hates that giant meatball 👀 PIZZA HUT FRIES We don't have Jack in the box here Wendy's fries have been super good lately. Hot and fresh There used to be 3 movie theaters where I live. Now there's only 2 because one got turned into a 500th church :PleasePBJustStop: I live near a Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins combo store What?

I actually don't eat any seafood I wish I had taken some pictures of pictures so I can show you all the snow I assume Iceland is different now with global warming and stuff I mean not drastically But there's this picture of me when I was maybe 2, and the snow was taller than me and I'm very bundled up Aren't you guys worried about mosquitos? I don't think I'd go anywhere tropical Ironically, every bug BUT mosquitos is attracted to me :PleasePBJustStop: One time a stink bug got caught in my hair and I was...so close...to just cutting all my hair off Traumatizing Australia? We have roaches here I am terrified of roaches Every so often this truck drives around with a massive bug sprayer in the back in order to control the mosquito population What I hear banana peels help with bug bites Oh we still have spray trucks here ^ Probably because it's Florida What do you mean Also yes. Unfortunately. It's so hot all the time Tomorrow is my birthday :dead: Aw you gave me the birthday role 🥺 It's early for me but I accept it It's 1:44 PM here I'm in the small section of Florida in a different time zone The rest of the state is an hour ahead I hope it will be too It's tomorrow but I love you both And you too Pri Thanks you guys 🥺 It's about an hour past the time I was born (and also past midnight) so it's ~officially~ my birthday now We love you Mara please take care of yourself Wait who's Gaius Can't remember everyone's changed their names for holidays What no Read Mara's new name Who is Gaius Y'all C'mon it's my birthday I kinda feel like I'm being made fun of :Dopeysad: Metta explained it to me I'm sorry, I don't always understand jokes Actually that clown cat would be a good emote...

That's a good one Found out two of my favorite meme cat's owners are in a partnership with some company to make them NFTs :PleasePBJustStop: Under the list of all the cats it says they're "in partnership" with some charity stuff I guess? But they're all gonna be turned into NFTs Grumpy cat's owner and the owner of the cat in front of the salad with the lady yelling meme (Tartar Sauce and Smudge) Yes She passed a few years ago What the fuck Hey!!! I didn't say this but I agree There's...so many I've been so preoccupied since Christmas I'm sorry I haven't talked with you all :SadCat: :judgeyfroge: Listen I know I live in Florida but it should *not* be 78 degrees in JANUARY (25.5 C) The fact my AC has to be on makes me so fucking angry...every year before this one we'd have the heater on. But for some reason my parents are still "lol global warming not real" I just want to wear cozy pajamas! How are y'all I got to have the heater on today :toooocute: Cozy pajamas here I come When you said this I thought you were talking about the actor and was like "who...who is going to tell her :blobsweat: " I love Emma Watson What house are you guys I'm a Hufflepuff I got the same result on Pottermore as I did another quiz, but I feel the other quiz is more accurate overall as it includes all possible questions Pottermore can give you Ok that emoji is...kinda scary ngl The Sam one not hamster Did you put that in this server because I can't find it and I had a joke No front facing Sam emote Yeah How did Metta use it I can't find it Hamster has been here for a while I know that :angrysam: FOUND IT :angrysam: 

You wake up with sleep paralysis and this is at the end of your bed staring at you, wyd :judgeyfroge: ...+Desire +Decorum Mood In other news I'm playing TWD game and got to the dreaded dog part and I'm literally almost in tears BRO ME TOOOOOO When I watched this episode on YouTube years ago I just couldn't like the video I actually covered the screen I couldn't handle it Bro I'm literally almost in tears rn why did Telltale do this Have you heard of the website does the dog die? Yes! It tells you if a dog dies in a movie Along with other triggers, like ||child abuse|| I use it all the time I'm scared to know what you thought it was It's because of Pillsbury saying copyright Yes It's called Great British Baking Show in the US because of Pillsbury Copyrighting the term "bake off" This is House MD erasure No Why did I not register that Open Heart isn't TV until just now Yes...it's terminal.

People post there "best nine" their 9 most liked posts of the year. If Starboard did something like that it would be so cool...but instead of 9 it would be 3 or 5 :Dopeyhappy: Really? :toooocute: Jesus how many stars did you give him for it to make it in the top 3/5 most starred messages of the past year? It doesn't exist it was just an idea I have But Pri thinks she can make it a thing!! Maybe for all time but I was saying for the last year only That'd take a long time, especially with the glitches making some pop up multiple times I mean I have nothing better to do and can do it but I cba rn Mara wrong channel No not mini modding I don't think it works in here Are they from 2021 tho? Have I said anything in the server in the past 6 hours Searched my name but maybe it got deleted Ok thanks guys. Had nightmare Did I teleport up North or something (5.5 C but feels like 2.2) It's supposed to get to 39 later tonight but because of the wind it'll probably feel below freezing I made s'mores on my stove though so it's ok What is "The Talk"? Does anyone remember Dinosaur Office from the 3DS video channel I'm watching a different compilation right now, I love it so much I was right about the 2s and bad luck, I got locked out of the house this morning :PleasePBJustStop: For context People always wonder why black LIs are the least popular but literally the answer is always racism. That's it Didn't Adrian have like...a thing with Gaius Or something I actually didn't know he was mixed until someone told me. I only ever heard him mention being Brazilian Ok all but the 2nd one are gorgeous Watched Sense and Sensibility on Valentine's. Alan Rickman was in it.

Wish I screenshotted it There were 4 different links to click on I wasn't gonna read all that. If it's not interesting I can't pay attention Plus I would still be using Discord anyway 🤷🏼‍♂️ Not like I'm joining a company to work at or anything Guys I have a confession...I don't like mangoes...or most pies :sadclown: :blobsweat: I like pumpkin and this one pie that was chocolate and had a cookie on top. Granted there's pies I haven't tried but when I tried apple pie I said it was "too apple-y" :dead: Also mangoes taste like cheese and not in a good way I think I just don't like dessert apples? Because pink lady apples are my favorite fruit NOOOO Thwarted by Mara when everyone else is asleep :adminabooz: :SadCat: Are you ok? Why not? How did this happen? Have y'all called anyone? Is that a lot Yes but is that cheap for electrical work Why is every server I'm in so quiet :SadCat: Who tf is that 1% I just wanna talk He's punchable Have you ever just found a movie on Netflix or something that's really good but then you find out it bombed at the box office and the sequel was canceled :SadCat: ? Fast Color No fucking way Say sike rn :oliviastab: Gary Garrison Hey. If I want to bring awareness to/talk about something going on in my area personally, would I go to #😡let-it-go or #🗣education-channel I'm scared I'll dox myself though so maybe not I was going to send a news article I'll send it later pictures and emotes don't work even if you send them Discord is officially back I think so here's an ad I got. The context is she's supposed to be dressing up for a wedding Hey guys how was y'all's days? Amazing Mara thank you Hey I'm so tired And have a headache There's less smoke in the sky though I think so that's good Fires Like, massive fires So I found out today, after so much frustration I almost had a melt down trying to fix it so I can add purchases to my phone bill, that Verizon has dropped Google Play and won't tell anyone why Bro you let me down during the fucking hurricane (AT&T still had signal) and now you wanna do this? 🔪 I'm gonna square up I just wanted the $5 diamond pack "It's a business move" ok but HOW Anyway I used my debit card :Dopeycat: ...👀 WOOOOOOO ? I hope you all are well Some states have already ditched DST. Apparently the whole thing was for farmers but modern farmers hate it Anyone else just...really like getting the mail for some reason Our mailman gives us magazines that belonged to people who have moved. When you move and you haven't changed your address for the subscription yet, the magazines get their addresses blacked out and given to other people So the new home owners don't get the other person's mail :worry: Oh not you Mara It was @ the Tale thing :SadCat: Promise I was not being mean Thank you for the head pats of reassurance Well, I can tell you that before WWII blue was the feminine color and pink was the masculine color. Idk about before that though Kirby's Return To Dreamland 🥺 Only game I've played but I love the pink boy...poyo... Wait no that's a lie I played a little of the one that came pre downloaded on my Switch Fuckin uhhh Hold on Super Kirby Clash I got Majora's Mask for 3DS...I never completed it because for some fucking reason you only have a certain amount of time to complete the game and it stressed me out, especially as a complete Zelda newbie Haven't touched it in years I completely forgot I own Kirby's Epic Yarn but only played it for like 10 minutes because most platform games were too hard for me at that age Do you guys remember the boat load of mini games on the Mario game for DS Those were my shit The find Luigi (?) I was SO good at this one "Wanted!" Oh no it's not I never owned Mario Party Let me go through my games rq Yes I know my nails are awful Mario Sports Mix? Kio hi!!! I feel like I haven't see you type in a while They did this in OH and it made me :ohgodohduck: Yeah I see you in my reactions :dogeheart: That's true I know everyone is different but I never felt like I wanted to...do stuff after losing someone Can we get a book set in Australia I feel like we've never gone there Not just for a book like travel wise too How have we never gone to Australia They were going to Asia in the end It's just nice to be different places Florida is a totally different climate than Minnesota Really PB is American and it's unlikely to have most books be outside of America so it'd be nice to have other places Didn't we go to Mexico in RCD Yeah it was to meet his dad We've never been to a Southern state that's not Florida...and if it's South Florida (ie Orlando) it barely counts because South Florida is basically a Northern state, but hot and lower Not that I'd want to be in the bible belt :KEKWhands: HUSKY TIME I completely forgot everywhere we went in ROE Besides Italy And France But we've been to Paris dozens of times Why did Austria make me think of Magic Tree House My fucking SHIT as a kid Because they go back in time To like Idk what composer was from Austria WHAT No fuckin way Who This looks like some shit my old psychiatrist would make me circle Also the first o looks like the Instagram app logo But maybe that's because I'm not wearing my glasses Thank god Please don't change my screen name Like genuinely I hate April Fools Thank you What if a channel is still hidden :blobsweat: Is it Choices related Not saying it needs to be just wondering So uh 6...PM...? What time is it for you rn I'm too stupid to understand the slider It's 2:33PM for me Is that 10 Military time :PleasePBJustStop: Does anyone remember Petpet Park I loved that game so fucking much man like I watched a gameplay video and I started tearing up over pure nostalgia I miss it Idk what it was but it was just so cool to me Me and my drym did so much stuff for years I had Webkinz too but this was my thing when I got a bit older They actually stopped making plushes a few years back It's all digital pets now I actually logged in a few months ago. They really went heavy with the membership thing. Some games I remember playing as a child now require deluxe membership. Some require you've adopted a pet within the last year, which I understand because that used to be the requirement to keep your account open Oh yeah stuff in the W shop too Goddamit I remember buying that fucking teddy for free when I was 8, Ganz :oliviastab: Probably Most digital stuff is. Petpet Park went down in 2014. Fucking hurt Mine was a panda named Banana. I still have her I also have a girl lion with a mane...trans rights I never did Poptropica I did uh Webkinz, Petpet Park, Monkey Quest, the Nickelodeon chat rooms (rip), and I did Club Penguin like 2 years before it was kill Old friend told me I had to try it It was so dead What happened to all the fucking games man Now it's just bs Go to the Nickelodeon website and they used to have so many games...now it's just a bunch of shit clips and like, one or two games, if even, per show Yes I like nostalgia don't judge me Monkey Quest went down so fast. I think I was like 15? When it was airing. They introduced a membership and made it so that free members can't complete key quests without paying actual money That's so scummy Oh man do you remember that iconic Lilo & Stitch sandwich game I see people talk about it Like on Twitter "this game slapped remember this??" Oh man the Babrie games... Fucking SLAPPED Kio you just made me remember I was also in McDonald's world thing and Ty/Beanie Babies. The latter was AMAZING Myscene too Also I named my lion Cheese. Had a bit of an unintentional food theme Literally like what kid cares about clip shows give them Barbie makeover games God I just realized how like...weirdly obsessed with gender I was .-. If I wrote notes about my stuffed animals I HAD to specify their gender even though nobosg else was gonna read it THE ARCADE THE ARCADE IS THE ONE I WAS ALWAYS THERE The arcade was so many games. The fairy world was for everything fantasy movie themed. The closet was fashion and makeup. The bedroom I think was everythinggirl.com or something? I remember it had a password book Oh that one was so good The amount of SpongeBob games lost to time physically hurts me You mean kinda like how icarly.com is real? Flashbacks to #notmyrodrick Zoo wee mama It kinda reminds me of my parents. Every time a brand does something super liberal (excluding gay marriage since they support that) they "boycott" it. Like Ben & Jerry's and what used to be Aunt Jemima syrup. "The future is now old man", and they'll soon only be few brands they're not refusing to buy. I feel NFTs are similar Disney does not give a fuck like LOL But yeah Tatsu does a lot in this server, us having it isn't contributing to NFTs at all There'd be a lot of unnecessary changes if we got rid of it Sorry for late reply I went to the grocery store Like my Dad bought a Ben & Jerry's ice cream and when my Mom found out it was that brand she refused to eat it. And I think it went bad and was thrown away. Like...man it's already been paid for. "It's the principle" I promise you Ben and Jerry do not give a fuck YES My Dad gets super offended if someone says Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas You know Hannukah is a thing right? Like Throwback to when I proved to him the words God and Jesus aren't in the Constitution :zoeywink: :blobsweat: It's funny because like My Dad is a total hardass. Has been military since before I was born. Goes on tangents about freedom of speech and freedom and "greatest country in the world" "But also if you say Happy Holidays you're infringing on my rights to live in a Christian nation" Which... ^ My parents are both Republicans. But my Mom is more left than my Dad For British that's tory My Mom came up to me a few months ago and told me her and her Bible group were trying to figure out why young people aren't Christian Honestly I don't feel the need to have a religion. I used to be because my Mom baptized me Catholic but it got to a point I realized I was only believing because Hell terrified me. Plus I don't have rights because of that fucking book I think when I came out as "lesbian" (before trans) it put things in perspective a little for my Dad. My parents never threatened to disown, convert, or kick me out for liking women Didn't Jesus literally die so nobody had to follow the old one Genuinely So you're telling me without god you would murder people? :blobsweat: And religious people like that, Lu, are the best ones Me thinking about how my stupid military insurance doesn't cover top surgery so I need to pay $10000 out of pocket :PleasePBJustStop: I don't know It cover hormones, but not surgery. They cover tube tying for sterilization, but not hysterectomies (unless it's medically necessary like cancer) The thing is, I NEED the surgery.  It's not the same as getting a nose job BuT wHaT iF yOu ReGrEt It :cooldown: Transgender surgeries are not cosmetic If I am old enough to have a child I am damn well old enough to not have one. Kids are more permanent than being sterilized And that you're 30 with 3 kids 🤪 By this I mean adoption. You can't get rid of a kid. They'll want to find you once they age out of foster care and pregnancy often has permanent effects Thinking about my old doc who was literally so fucking amazing, she gave me an inhaler when bronchitis caused me to not be able to breathe when my primary doc just thought I was being dramatic. Found out later she also gave my old coworker her bisalp before moving to a different city Pregnancy and childbirth absolutely terrify me, what makes you think I want bio kids I would resent them Nobody should have kids they don't want "But it's not REALLY your kid" Yes it fucking is I miss her she was genuinely amazing. My new doc is nothing compared to her I had a painful hemorrhagic cyst and had panic attacks over going to see her but she was so nice and understanding I don't want any kids ever either, I understand I get it. I'm glad it helped you with Rusty. Ginger is on her way out, she has late stage kidney disease; and I lost my first dog when I was 14. I know how hard it is and I know you seem to still hurt sometimes. And same lol my Mom is actually completely content having granddogs, since she's the one that made my love for them. She is very much a dog mom Oh this reminds me What caused the switch? Who is y'all's favorite starter Pokémon For mine...take a wild guess Litten and sprigatito? Is this sarcasm or genuine :ohgodohduck: Out of every gen who is your #1 favorite starter Hell YEAH!!! Bulbasaur fan club!!! ~~That's actually the name of my private story on Snapchat~~ Oh I have a collection Not pictured: Socks, pajamas, a lanyard with keychain, and Bulid-A-Bear bulbasaur Silver is 25th anniversary addition Stand in the front is from my most recent birthday cake LEGO to the left is a knockoff I found in a mall :MunchlaxMunch: God I love that funky dude https://tenor.com/view/marge-i-just-think-theyre-neat-the-simpsons-neat-potato-gif-8549864 I was ON IT when I found out they were making a bulbasaur POP! figure. I was at Walmart the first day of release like :takemymoney: :oliviastab: :dogelick: Sorry I promise I'm not one upping you I just really like him and Pokémon is a special interest of mine :SadCat: Oh my god I completely forgot about my Pop socket and Pez dispenser Let me turn on my status real quick to make it bigger 5 now :JoJoThink: :oliviastab: Daylily supremacy :yeetedtothemax: Metta :SadCat: Noot noot Daylily gang rise up :oliviastab: :SadCat: My joints Bicker of ass? I hope everyone had a nice day :dogeheart: Anyone wanna tell me about how their day went? Someone hit a pole and cut off all the power for miles :PleasePBJustStop: Why does this keep happening 3 weeks ago it didn't last this long but still At least it's semi cool ig Temperature wise That's cool How long has it been since you've seen each other I'm sorry Drew Where do you put ur cables I can't read But Throwback to post hurricane when people would rent fucking...garbage/waste trucks to pick apart trash to sell for money, and this guy didn't know what the fuck he was doing and hit the lines, causing the wires AND the truck scoop to catch on fire :PleasePBJustStop: Right outside my goddamn house PSA Yes I knew this but apparently according to the reels on Instagram that are reposted from tiktok, people do not I can't believe people don't do it I'm so paranoid I do it after like every load Honestly this goes double if you have the laundry day pack in The Sims 4...shit will burst into flames after like, 2 loads :dogelick: ~~someone send e minor~~ I really need to go back and watch old SpongeBob Thinking about the time a guy in my class said he wouldn't eat Skittles because the rainbow is gay :PleasePBJustStop: For the amount I use tired emotes like that you'd think I would be into cigarettes but I have never smoked in my life What is y'all's favorite candy Coke. Just regular Coke I feel the same way. Sometimes I'll just go and look for little surveys I can answer Cold water when I come in from a Pokémon Go session HITS Chilly, cloudy, light breeze. Not super humid Anything below 74 is good in my book Florida :PleasePBJustStop: Here's one people never ask at our age ~~except me because I like to know 😔~~ What is your favorite color Mine is yellow God I love dogs Rusty is doing well btw Oh...a baby... Good morning guys Hi Mara!!! :dogeheart: You guys doing anything for Easter? I'm going to play Animal Crossing and eat some candy 😃 YES IT IS Did you guys see Scrat got his acorn https://www.instagram.com/reel/CcVH4BVqvk3/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y= Remember the Ice Age baby memes I barely even remember the movie he was in :ohgodohduck: All I remember from later movies was them getting Nicki Minaj to do a voice Thinking about all the candy I'm gonna eat tomorrow My Mom said she's gonna make cinnamon rolls for breakfast too Hell yeah Hoppy Easter 🐰🐣🍫🍬 Do you ever just look at your pet sleeping and feel an overwhelming amount of love Is that good or bad? Then congratulations!! Hey guys any plans for the weekend? I just got back from watching Sonic 2 and I am tired Also sick because I gorged on popcorn after hardly eating today Big nostalgia trip!!! Oh man I was shaking when this big thing happened Nostalgia for me personally. I know the whole movie seems to be an AU but it made me feel 13 again And as you know from previews and the 2, Tails is in it and I love him sm Would die for him 10/10 so wholesome There is once again a mid credits scene so don't leave Me after the mid credits scene: Have fun at beach 🏖🌊 The spirit of Earth Day is truly upon me...SIX toads in my backyard, along with the numerous translucent baby lizards that come out at night. Amazing Am inside now 😔🤘🏻 Has anyone here been to St. Augustine? No :GaibooShock: :Bonk: Also hi Mara :dogeheart: St. Augustine is the oldest city in Florida Not to sound nerdy, but I really enjoy planning trips. I was super hyperfixated into Disney World a year ago, but it seems more likely we'll go there, Chicago, or Gatlinburg. So I've been researching and planning things to do, prices, all that stuff I could be a travel agent if I wouldn't quit after 2 days of dealing with Karens :PleasePBJustStop: I'm just planning for me, my parents, and my brother. Of course we're not going anywhere until Ginger passes but I just love planning and organizing so much I like to get a head start I'm sorry Frat :( I know things can be stressful, but it helps to be excited and I'm glad yoy are That's cool Ok when I was doing my ~research~ I found that there's both a pirate AND shipwreck museum? Why can't they just be combined into one big museum Also good morning guys Hot :PleasePBJustStop: Oh yeah I'm way more North than Miami ~~It's always both~~ It's ok but feels a little...try hard-y You can say woman Mara, it's ok "This book is told from the perspective of a woman. There are primarily het relationships with some gay ones thrown in also" Don't make it harder than it needs to be ok? I appreciate the effort, though :dogeheart: Yeah, gay can either be an umbrella for lesbian and gay men and sometimes it can just mean gay men, so if it's only lesbian it'd be better to say lesbian 13, but if we're being real technical my brother and I actually started with a Game Boy Advance SP I had so much fun with the PS2 Y'all ok? Feels like the server isn't as active as normal Over the past few days it's just felt less is all Ayyyy My middle school had a lot of fights. On my 13th birthday two kids got into it in the parking lot and were detained Another time one broke out in the doorway to another building and I got my head pushed into the brick wall just trying to get to class For non Americans middle school is ages 11 to 14 :ethonks: A ghost? A server ghost? Why would it be available on Desktop only WHY DOES IT ONLY SHOW UP ON MOBILE IF YOU SEARCH FOR MESSAGES BY BIRTHDAY BOT Mara I have something to show you I was going through my gallery, found the picture on the left, and made this He was in a jar. This was from Wizard's Unite, before it shut down. It was Pokémon Go for Harry Potter The fucking entitlement If you want a child so fucking bad go adopt one Y'all it was so fucking hot today hell fire season is officially here I stepped outside to put the towels in the dryer (our laundry room isn't accessible from indoors) and it was like WHOOSH All hot air Like a fucking sauna It's not Florida without high humidity :PleasePBJustStop: Is it nice or suffocating? I rarely see fog Also another sigh hell fire season is here Mosquito truck man is back I have 3 seasons: cold, hot, and hellfire What happened A popularity contest? Probably fucking is I'm sorry Do you want to switch? If things get really bad with his leadership, is there someone you can go to to have him removed? Do your best, ok? Yeah I figured it was at a school, which is why I brought uo the advisor bit As he should Me @ him: :cooldown: I'm sorry y'all. I knew my dumb bitch disease was severe but I didn't know it was contagious :sadhours: 😔🤘🏻 Lock me up :dead: 666 feet underground Drew I should tell you...it's terminal :sadhours: I have 69 seconds to live :GaibooShock: Bel has a severe case... RIP Bel...we'll die different, but together *coughs* Fratting? :worry: :cooldown: Are you yassifying That what *CONTAGION* Pri run you'll get my severe DBD :worry: How much did you pay Mara making bank RIP Pri you can join me and Drew's funeral Damn, now I'm imagining that The worst foot injury I had was when a stone stocking holder fell from the TV stand onto my big toe In shock probably Adrenaline High pain tolerance A real super hero... Jesus christ I could never How Iconic HNNNNNN That reminds me of that horrible gif With the toothpick NOOO I've split a toenail before Was sobbing Wasn't even that bad :KEKWhands: How long did it take to grow back? Oh that's a bot we have? Heheh .cowsay YEET Beautiful. Remarkable. Absolutely  gorgeous I meant cowsay :SadCat: I live up to my name once again That movie is a fucking masterpiece and not enough people meme it .cowsay All hopped up on Diet Coke and Jolly Ranchers... LMAO Hey Frat It's been storming for the past 3 days. Was basically a monsoon yesterday and took a fat nap It's stopped raining for now but maybe I'll have some hot chocolate later if it picks back up Also have a headache Can't do the weather thing because I'll dox myself more than I do when I talk about hurricane Michael but it's 73 degrees, cloudy, raining on and off, and there's a tornado watch somewhere I know damn well if I step outside it will NOT feel like 73 tho Florida is massive. If you drive 8 hours you are still in Florida It's probably 30 degrees warmer and sunny in like, Miami Dear lord It was fucking hot here too I am never stepping foot outside during late June to early August I swear I will melt on the SPOT Yes I am a Floridian. Yes I hate Florida. We exist I was referencing a meme :sadclown: Let me pull up Google rq Ok it's only SUPPOSEDLY gonna get this hot today but there's a 99% chance it'll say "feels like 93" or higher :PleasePBJustStop: Any temperature I see on the weather channel is a goddamn scam it's always gonna feel way hotter The humidity makes it feel hotter than it actually is Not to mention the sun beating down on my poor, pasty ginger soul. Killing me slowly I will fist fight the sun and solve all our problems Man I love Winter. If I'm cold I can have delicious hot chocolate, wear my favorite sweater, have blankets...if it's hot I cannot rip my skin off because that is all I wanna do Not to mention my scalp gets hot. I itch. I consider shaving my head Winter is the only break I get from Florida actively trying to kill my heat sensitive ass Heat sensitive gang LOL they don't here either. It's all Summer...except for late December through early February when it can get to the 30s sometimes That's near freezing Freezing is 32 Thunder scares my dogs And lightning makes me paranoid Florida is the lightning state I don't wanna get crispy My biggest hate is wind and rain, because that's what hurricanes are Not me talking about hurricane Michael again :raifepain: Bro I HATE the beach fuck the beach Hold on I'm gonna send a picture on why I don't like winds This used to be a pet supply store Yeah. There were a few torandos while it was happening and it got hit But they've since relocated to a bigger location Was there the other day My Dad took us all to drive around where we could to see the damage. But this was all back in 2018 Is Singapore big? Florida is 721 km But it feels forever Going to Disney World takes the whole day Well Orlando in general WHAT I can't fucking read It's an estimate, especially considering the Florida Keys. They're like...mini islands? Kind of? But it's not ENTIRELY connected to the bottom of Florida ~~Not to mention mosquito central. Would never visit~~ Yeah. We have a mosquito guy. During the season they go throughout neighborhoods just spraying for mosquitos. But the Keys are marshlands, which they love I don't live anywhere near the Keys tho People are like "I hate small talk talking about the weather is boring" No it's not it's nice. Bonding moments. Like hearing about snows and heat Oh yeah, I haven't seen snow since I lived in Iceland But I need to go to bed...phone at 9% 😔🤘🏻 And also 3:31 AM Is it muggy out? I hate after rain air Ok not muggy since you said it's cold but like...humid Summer is coming which reminds me, if you leave your dog in a hot car you're a fucking piece of shit Yes 100% And a dog stolen by me Oh it's fucking hot, I've gotten heat exhaustion playing Pokémon Go before During the Summer it's the definition of sweltering Throwback to when my brother watched the Harry Potter movies with his friend and I asked what house she was What ingredients do you have? This is the second time this dog has appeared in my explore feed and his eyes are so human it's so unsettling :worry: :hello911: STOP LMAO Isn't...isn't this from Choices? Like not the inspiration like literally the art 💀 Nobody is mentioning it in the replies I feel like that meme of the guy in the corner of a party "They don't know it's from a game" It's still funny I just looked up TRH book 1 chapter 1 because I know I saw it there and it is, in fact, the art Are there any Canadians that have been to college here Y'all ok? I'm about to take brownies out the oven who wants one Good. I'm happy I got to bake again I had to have my brother pick up some eggs for me But I wish I could do it more. Like I used to Who here was the server baker besides me Thank you Drew I am going to commit a felony I still hear fireworks Can someone move the ID channel Grey with light brown center How is my favorite server today? Something that can't be said in this channel :PleasePBJustStop: I've been on the internet for a long time Frat it's inevitable Thank you FREE HIM WHAT AM I NOT ASKING Give us updates I love you too Aku 🥺 Absolutely agree Lord Ginger Pizza of Lush Crying because I am in fact ginger But she was named after the spice Anyone else been like super tired lately I'm on mobile and don't notice anything different Hey I'm gonna be on a much higher dose of my meds than usual tomorrow so if I say anything weird in chat don't worry about it No weirdness, don't worry mods. Just feel more calm than I ever have Oh it's not a new doasage 😅 I just had to take a high dose because of something massively anxiety enducing today in order to be able to get through it I'm gonna ask my psych if maybe this should be my standard dosage instead HAPPY BIRTHDAY DREW Bought these from an Asian market and they slap. Literally tastes like soft serve. Definitely recommend Also got Japanese melon candies WHAT Bro it's gonna be all over every news Brits are we happy or sad about the Queen's death Ireland is having an absolute field day on Twitter MILQUE I MISSED YOU Hey Frat It's been raining massively today Been bad lately. I like it because it's mostly not sun showers which means it's less hot but also it makes bugs come out And the dogs don't wanna pee when it's raining Hey y'all, how is everyone? Been out of town all day. Exhausted. Signal is sparse on these roads but I have it rn Aw hell yeah I'm home. Took a shower and am in pajamas. Exhausted Unfortunately my Mom cleans the entire house every Friday (has as long as I can remember) and will in fact be waking me up at 7AM Good thing I'm on meds that let me nap good Is that his butt This angle is so confusing Chonk... Tbf having legs underneath makes them look bigger Eat It's waffles Cassian made waffles then the infamous scene happened "Say you don't like breakfast: Free" 12 diamonds "Sit and eat breakfast" was 18 Thanks Drew My Dad was upset earlier because he's neglected our generator and now it won't work. It's not big enough to power the whole house but it kept the fridge and freezer going But yeah if something hits PR it'll probably come around here and vice versa Lowkey anxious about it because I'm kind of traumatized from Michael I'd say that's fair An update, according to my Dad we're gonna get most likely a cat 2 on Thursday. Which...ngl isn't promising. When Michael happened it was also supposed to be a cat 2. But then the day before it got way worse Yes, Michelle is Asian Maybe Nikhil was the best side character I had absolutely ZERO hesitation on saving him PB be like "let's fix something that's not broken in the slightest" She's going to look so beautiful I'm calling it now Is it weird I'm kinda hoping for a purple or light blue dress? I feel like she'd look great in those colors OR A SUIT Zoey in a suit would be so good!!!! Not purple or light blue suit necessarily Why is it odd Have we even had a female LI wear a suit as formal wear before? Not as formal wear tho Kamilah wears a dress when they go to parties Wait he *what* What is happening I thought you guys were talking about canon stuff WTF I wasn't talking about you leaving what You guys made me think Bertrand actually dies They're talking about something from the writing channel Yeah idk why it's in this channel Bro I could send PB a list of names they haven't used there is no excuse Ava too!!! Someone says they like Ava on a subreddit question and I'm like "ILITW or MTFL?" One of those was D&D default name Roxanne Octavia Not me using Emilia in TRH :HOLUP: Yeah Bartie's best form was Amelia's sprite Yeah it's her face Which is Barite feminized Reason number 53 why I don't want kids: What if they look like the Bartie sprtie Anyone who hurts my TRH baby will die by my blade LMAO They were really like "Oh shit we already used this sprite as a major character" Probably TRH sprites Because they like to find ways to reuse assets It kills them to not have a reuse for one Remember in STD When a customer had Lindsay's face While she was *right there* Yes it's Rico But Bartie is more well known Rico was the worst form until Bartie began speaking full sentences Maybe in BaBu we'll have faternal twins - One boy one girl, and we'll get a new sprite for the boy Fuck off I say "we" like I've actually read that shit :kek: Do not like him Every time I see his sad face...the "daddy no! Daddy stay!" scene...it haunts me... That sounds about right Character...something The new update fixed the glitch! I also didn't see any preview shoulders What wrong with Holmes? @MaralinaSakura What does that have to do with him? https://www.pinterest.com/grayswalkers/choicestm-game-backgrounds/?%24ios_deeplink_path=pinterest%3A%2F%2Fboard%2Fgrayswalkers%2Fchoicestm-game-backgrounds&%24android_deeplink_path=pinterest%3A%2F%2Fboard%2Fgrayswalkers%2Fchoicestm-game-backgrounds&amp_client_id=1nuBhFt-WYA25nVxUr7yMjmsfaprnKPbDYckeub7aaRc-VwvSX_VmSasfJbqPhFf&utm_source=168&utm_medium=2160&current_page_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Famp%2Fgrayswalkers%2Fchoicestm-game-backgrounds%2F&install_id=762106bfde2c449cb7293f1f849edb9d&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fgrayswalkers%2Fchoicestm-game-backgrounds%2F&amp_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Famp%2Fgrayswalkers%2Fchoicestm-game-backgrounds%2F&_branch_match_id=816359255681708053 Masterlist of Choices backgrounds I found while searching for Sims 4 accuracy I don't know how Was there an option to only have one or the other? I wasn't a fan of #LH until I did the diamond playthrough tbh Also they added new diamond choices in the beginning but cba to make it not call you the default name I did I got all but 2 I can't remember a guy in ATV and TC&TF Well I can't spell Annalyse whatever I forgot Shane was even a LI Kepler Love her OH WAIT No I spelled her name right I can't remember that barely LI guy from PM His name I mean Yeah him ZEKEI That's who I forgot Yeah so I got all but 2 Aloe Not me trying to type in books that aren't even on the list Amazing That's weird, they accepted Hamid for me Ok who did you forget Mood Am I allowed to mute the announcements channel Sloane being functional is debatable She's in functional in the picture I thought Zoey was a lesbian tbh Not necessarily. You can acknowledge someone isn't ugly without being attracted to them I still think she's gay 🤷🏻‍♂️ I think a select few books are outside the PB universe Like ACOR I actually wanna know where the apple thing came from and when it started Wiscosin cheese... :DogeLick: But like the midwest doesn't have corn has an areawide symbol :marafrogemoji: I hate that they made VOS TV universe Also AME is kinda special in the sense that we know it's a TV show from the start It's mentioned as a TV show in RCD book 3, as a booth at the comic con thing How? BP is the only book I haven't played Yeet OMG IT WORKS Thank u Sara https://www.instagram.com/p/CJsqDYjlaNU/?igshid=1iie8y790oz23 I'm really hoping they use these faces elsewhere ESPECIALLY Hispanic Elijah's hair (but he's in a different post not linked) I mean she sure as hell acts like it Lol remember in Witness when they assumed we bought the swimsuit I'm so fucking dumb how did I not know she was from dokidoki until you said her name Who's neutral good His angry face is him being shocked at the audacity of someone else Corgi! People ask me why I don't like children when those 2 exist They're not real but I've seen kids like them Where is the insider It's almost 4 PM here I was on the wrong account I think Holmes loses a leg too Oh my god how did we forget Skye Did they get their heart broken by a woman with red hair and now is petty about it I know that's why I mentioned her 😞 We have a writer that hates redhead women apparently I wanna know who That was a thing? I wasn't here for that But it does seem like he has some sort of bias. I wouldn't call him evil though Why? I did mention Holmes And every other male with red hair is a villian I think Silas had brown hair It's really weird I want one (1) ginger that isn't tortured or a villian Travis 🥺  He had that whole grandma thing but I wouldn't consider that tortured. I can't believe I forgot about him It's ok you can say the black bob Wait who's Emily again OH TF MC? The design reminds me of someone... Rachel Amber from LiS? No maybe this girl I saw in a music video I can't think of what else we can swap can you give examples I think I've actually seen that somewhere Instagram maybe? I always accidentally read BIPOC as biopic Wow thank you I can hardly tell the difference between actress and bachelorette "Several people are typing..." Ok I screenshotted actress, bachelorette, and professor and compared them and the hands are the only difference I see Oh god oh fuck they're all so similar I only see hand differences Also What is this 😭 Also what I'm getting is they put MC bodies on LIs? So everyone that wanted male VOS MC as a LI has *technically* gotten that Seeing the elves and orc bare sprites are so cool I want to look like the male elf sprite Except...not headless A what sprite I thought you were calling a human sprite an otter- Oh she's so cute I named her Marlene After the otter in the Penguins Of Madagascar TV show How do I do the image search ,img or something .img? .img marlene penguins of Madagascar Oh Was gonna show u guys Marlene One of the like 2 times we got free ombre hair (The other is WT) Aren't they the same? Am I a fucking idiot I picked that hair for my BSC MC Oh my god it is different I actually was female in BSC despite it being GOC and I'm sweating because I used one of the 2 faces that carried into the BB set (Hispanic) and the BB set had been used 3 times now and I really don't wanna reuse a face Or go back and change to one of the abandoned BSC faces Because I have a feeling it's gonna be used again They were a lil ugly but it's ok I actually wish they would be Ya know for "new" content The white OH female face haunts me every time I see it I tried to do it but I love all my MCs they're like my little OCs 😭 Except Witness MC she's F tier I actually wouldn't put them all in S tier That's some top shit Like ACOR MC But I had a hard time after that Like badass Super cool God no fucking wonder I hate white OH female MC so much She's all I see on the sub Seeing black male be in dead last almost every single time made me so angry The sub is racist. Sometimes quiety but other times, when it comes to people like Jackie or Zoey (ik Jackie is Indian it's just an example), it shines through The amount of hate the post gets every time someone brings this up on the sub is massive Yeah the numbers would definitely be higher if they included a Hispanic option in the first place Why did this make me think you were gonna rick roll me 💀 I feel like if Choices mentioned rick rolling it would be called "simon spin" or some shit Fuck I didn't get a notif AGAIN Oh another recipe! I love that They should do one for Raj's drinks Or anything he did ? Oh Wait is it really the same bloodline? That's so cool Every time I uninstall the app to install the mod to do a diamond replay I feel like I'm leaving home to go on vacation Anyway this time I'm doing D&D Had a thought about PB and book quality after seeing a meme on the Reddit So like All the books on VIP (except for what I've heard about WB) are pretty good, right? And we've been getting nothing absolutely amazing lately Maybe....maybe that's on purpose In hopes that people will buy VIP instead of uninstalling I didn't say they were *bad* necessarily, I've mentioned this before but I enjoy every book except Witness. They just seem to be doing all the passion projects in VIP Quite a shame Kinda sucks since hasn't Andrew been the saving grace for years Oh don't get me started on that January of last year seems like 3 years ago My buff orc gf 😔🤘🏻 I'm hoping it gets better book 2. Like they'll pull an Aster, hopefully ~~Stan Aster~~ She was barely existant in book 1 but she got more scenes when book 2 comes We have the same MC for RT, FA, HSS, BaBu, and OH I'd say ATV too but I can't see the hair with the hat This is bothering me PB's favorite names are Thomas and Ava FUCK now my headcanon is dead You would absolutely be surprised how many parents are like this. If you put you don't want kids on a dating profile they'll still message you because they think their kids are "different" Definitely I actually really enjoyed WEH's soundtrack too Me rn because I don't have FB and all I see is the login link sent several times :PleasePBJustStop: Is this the premise of MM? Don't have VIP Also I haven't played BP but I will never get over the fact the blonde girl isn't wearing a dress This edited version of white female OH face is better than the original 😳 I hope the book with the all black cast will be set MC like ROE instead of making us choose a face. I don't feel like seeing OH and ILB MC again Because she thought they originated from TFS at first Her name's been changing for a while now She hasn't been MLF for a few months The kids are killing me 😃 😃 Who sleeps with their glasses on bitch that's how they break Not to be annoying but I just reinstalled the mod...anyone want to guess what I'm diamond replaying this time? I've already done TF, TRR, ROE, TRM, TH:M, WT, #LH, ATV, D&D, TE, ES, RCD, VOS, PM, NB, HFTH, ACOR, THOBM, and PTR Sounds like a lot but there's also a lot left,, I'm sorry I don't understand the question Not yet! Nah, I've enjoyed every book except for Witness. Reinstalling the mod, I do diamond playthroughs (take almost every diamond choice) of books I have already completed, to give new perspective I enjoy it very much They better be doing somethin good Oh wow 5 years 🥺 Have they done anything yet? :PleasePBJustStop: :Dopeyangry: The lights haven't flickered in a good 20 minutes so that's a nice sign Still nothing about 5 years 😡 Why did my color change I don't like it Is that the Redfield thing? Can someone remove it please Thank you FINALLY they Tweeted something guys All they did was a Tweet...do they even care about the app anymore? Why in the world would they remove it It's LOA's *book* finale you say 👀 Putting that here because I have the channel muted during my BB replay Drew I absolutely agree with you Tag urself I'm the super dancer How do I find this out? The trending searches On my phone it only shows my previous searches "Can't screenshot because of security policy" 😭 I think the most interesting one is "Milk crates challenge" ?? I don't know I don't have tiktok Yes I'm pretty sure Insiders is out. Nothing really new Guy you'd like to kill? I was joking Actually have All Star downloaded onto my iPod...I am shameless And by iPod I mean iPod. The kind nobody but me uses anymore See that's what I'm saying It's gonna kill discussions Find it strange that even though AVSP isn't found under VIP anymore it's still not recommended to me next to BP Yeah I haven't started BP at all. But I haven't started AVSP at all, either I don't like it They remind me of the characters on the Surrender cover I mean it's better than the current cover though Best icon. Rest in peace :Dopeysad: Should I try Hollywood U once I get more space? 👗💆‍♀️✨ No Yes! Is this about her wanting to be hired by PB again? Also hey guys No, but she applied Yeah, her getting hired would have been disastrous And it was alright, thank you for asking And she reveals every detail "Take that Andrew Bui 👊" Why would you watermark them...they're not hers? She just put them together She has a script account that's on private I don't follow it it's just linked in her bio What if she tries to join the server :smart: :zoeywink: :SONIAWINK: :Periodt: :niapanic: :garbryce: :GabeThink: :CandidCarter: Oh no I'm having an identity crisis :ohgodohduck: Who I want nitro purely to have universal emojis...but I don't like spending my money How do I do the non Choices img It's important ,img Snivy Look how beautiful Ivy is here... I actually didn't choose Snivy but as a grass type fan it's nice to see them get the recognition they deserve *~~i.e. my pfp~~* The most hated starter of gen 5, tepig I named her Lucy Little pig baby... Gen 5/Unova was the first main series game I played so she's special Thank you 🥺 There she is!!!! For bulbasaur, before I got into Pokémon for some reason I told myself I would pick bulbasaur as my starter. I didn't really understand that each gen had different starters at the time. But then I got FOMO, downloaded Pokémon Go, picked bulbasaur, and have now played every single gen I got a restored copy of Pokémon Blue And have a bulbasaur collection I love him sm All the starters are so cute...there has never been an ugly starter and I will die on this hill If I get Legends of Arceus I was actually thinking of choosing oshawott because of how precious he is (The starters are gonna be rowlet, cyndaquil, and oshawott) I love that his name is Kevin I give all my starters human names My bulbasaur is Patty ERR? OH El romance royal Fuck sake Pretty sure I win the award for most edited messages due to misspellings in all of Choices Discord :PleasePBJustStop: Which is ironic because I'm actually a good speller I just fuck up typing Who is Jaz Ok I think I remember him yeah He was purple like Voltra At least in the server Rei is in he was Why do we hate him again Besides the know-it-all ness Why was he kicked? There's this emoji in another server of an angry guy with the ping notification and that's how I felt about @ everyone What I've always hated about the book 3 cover is...why is Adrian human But MC is feeding off him? What is it Drew? It was just humans but she was like "y'all are weaklings and I want my power back bitch" Maria maybe? I wasn't even interested in Jake as a LI at all but "boy scout" made me soft Am I in for a wild ride Every single one of you is correct Idk why I was expecting him to be holding a kitten he found on the way to school :dead: Too many animal videos As a Jen stan I have been summoned Please please please What about Travis I mean tbf he is a model It's only VIP until chapter 10 Yeah I know and I haven't bought diamonds since On the mod it's in VIP mode...but it's broken as hell.

Mods are Ethan stans I see Oh look - a generic white male Poppy stans vs Ethan stans choose your fighter LMAO That's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" sneaking up on Halloween THANK Why is it every male version of these I get someone I don't like :PleasePBJustStop: I mean Drake is straight. It's not only women seeing these I am actually...anxious, pessimistic, and dependent on others :huh: But interestingly enough this is one of the two stories I self inserted so...fitting ig Oh yes Time for my Thanksgiving to curse the server So my Mom doesn't season the turkey. Just slathers it in mayonnaise and cooks it Lay it is so dry I want to do a Friendsgiving so bad. I've wanted to go to one for years I don't have enough friends to do it. I could go to one if my best friend throws one but there's the issue of I do not pass well I'm so lonely :Dopeysad: Why are Mason and Mickey separate but not the BaBu twins? Why ? Yeah but M&M are super close Why is party twin hooking up with Elena :KEKWhands: That is white Marco, Travis has red hair and no beard OH YEAH I REMEMBER THIS Poptarts are amazing wym I have a confession to make guys I...microwave my Poptarts It's my usual breakfast.

Then what? So many facts tonight FINALLY...I love both of my ones... Blaine and Liam have my heart Untamable is that one ad of the girl enjoying the horse ride a lil too much Me too!! All I want is to see her grown up Spare change, PB? Wouldn't that mean we need a clone of the father/sperm donor too? No? He and Leo have different moms But same dad But Lena is his full sister Work in progress WIP nae nae Anger mess? Or OMG I've been talking about Princess Switch being a changeling thing in the other servers but didn't think it'd be actually about that but THE FAIRY EMOJI... :ohgodohduck: Princess And The Pauper? That's what I thought it'd most likely be But the fairy emoji made me a lil excited :judgeyfroge: I'm the person dressed as a bunch of grapes Wtf is a waif And is the widow holding a bottle or a gun Why is the orphan alone bruh :judgeyfroge: Yeah but shouldn't be still have supervision DELETE THIS I can't tell if that message has legit info or just predictions I'm sorry Because 2 through 6 I'm gonna need a source Where did Courses Of Norses come from YEAH When I wasn't talking about maybe it being changelings, I was thinking of that Barbie movie That might have to change though, since EVERY book except sequels are gonna be VIP to start now Ah ok, thank you What was it 👀 Looking through these and if they can remove all that from Locusta then they can remove the cyber lines and reuse ATV faces No she's not she's a different sprite That's the Fuck Queen from TRF? Thank What is the "you hey you" about :judgeyfroge: The worst part about this is the fact Robin and Sam consider each other siblings She's from Blades Keiki actually looks really good with Bryce's hair Why the hell did PB move the closet and settings button to the top Ok ngl I would actually read this :sadclown: MC's faces are killing me Why are the TNA ones always the most accurate What does she mean by "exception" Like...the only trans person she'd get with or...? Guys :sadclown: Andy doesn't deserve this I think it's more ignorance. Not intentional. I hear that wording all the time I get how you guys are thinking but coming out I would rather hear that then lose someone That's sort of what my best friend said to me when I told him and he has genuinely been my absolute biggest supporter and help He even bought me minoxidil :SadCat: Yes that's what I'm saying. I like to give people benefit of that doubt as there's so much misinformation Whole post is weird tho LOL I was just about to say "tag yourself" too I'm the very first pic ? Tatsu when can I level up :SadCat: Make my dream I hit green level come true 1 I'm 10 when +Desire What's the +Desire equivalent in SR again? :supbrah: OH YEAH FROM EARLIER I suggested this one too My dbd is terminal Some are a lil spider like Or is that just me Those are always weird to me Especially when they make the faces hyper realistic using editing Therapist: "Hyper realistic Choices faces aren't real, they can't hurt you"
Hyper Realistic Choices Faces: 
👁👄👁 They really sniped the community with the eaely access decision Pri!! Hey 😃 Sorry if I sound like an idiot but did you get married? Was that your date? :sadclown: I was about to congratulate you I am the whole circus Maybe it's not actually top 10 and they just put it on the romance/smutty books they want people to read? Just a conspiracy Let me check mine Well since I have the mod installed rn and haven't played a single thing yet, here is a screen of the recomendations: Just those 5 I don't know what a wordle is and at this point I'm too scared to ask what the colors mean Have they used the word worms yet? If not that's a crime. I mean...wordle worm 🪱 Immortal Desires sounds like WB part 2 BSC male is the male equivalent of ILITW female What's wrong with it? Why do they always erase the belly button I hope if it's a set face like ROE, it's a new one I can see it now...SR ads that are just an exact copy of TNA ads...movements and everything...the new cash cow I'll play SR if it becomes the new big thing, so I'm not left out. But I have to ask how the new "LI being a second MC" format is going because when I heard of it I didn't like it Cool. Thanks you guys They should go back to what they did in their golden years Cancelling all those books was a bad move, financially MURDER AT HOMECOMING? PB honey you have really been holding out on me with the non steamy book info HSS: Murder Club If there's anything I learned from Say Yes To The Dress, it's ignore your mother in law because she hates everything Sunkissed :hello911: I can't believe female Raleigh was my LI and I didn't recognize her with the blonde hair Damn BaBu 2 was really only 10 chapters? Oh What's wrong with BOLAS The moment you said slow paced I thought of MTFL :ohgodohduck: Yeah I haven't seen it in the servers I'm in at all Oh BIG Sebastian from TF energy Yeah I don't think I've seen that sprite before the bot showed it I'm so bored of only having one book a week I'm about to act tf up and read one of the books I said I wouldn't read Ms. Match please end soon so I can read you I really preferred when they mass released the exclusive VIP books all at once (so like AVSP, not WTD) so I've been waiting for them each to fully release I want to read something so bad I've been looking at BP and my twin headcanon like :SadCat: :ohgodohduck: 👀 The early access has really ruined things for me What is that supposed to mean :PleasePBJustStop: Sorry I wanna read the books locked behind VIP rn? Idk what you want me to say It really looks like it reading back I genuinely don't know how else I was supposed to interpret that It looked like it was for me Not necessarily. Normally people don't use the replies if there's no messages inbetween, if that makes sense I'm just trying to get you to understand my point of view https://tenor.com/view/kim-possible-whats-the-sitch-whats-up-sup-hey-gif-21520421 Yeah I know but I'm trying to say I am not being crazy Didn't say that but you have to understand why I would think it was for me That's all I was trying to do And y'all are like Shouldn't we be getting a blog for TPS before the 1st Like a general interview or a book specific If it's about SR it probably won't be until after finale Ah ok That'd be...April 7th First Thursday I think I'll start SR after the finale The new face is so pretty. I like her Hell yeah Yeah if a book turns into a series I absolutely have to read it Which is good because I really don't wanna read WB...people say it's so toxic On no not the ||incest||, people just say Bastien is...well, a red flag in himself Like worse than Justin STD But werewolves are cool God Justin :PleasePBJustStop: My MC and Simon, being cute and wanting to run a wedding planning business: :furballhappy: :Dopeyhappy: 
Justin, trying to come after me in my totally new job even though he's not even my boss anymore: :Dopeyangry: :sadclown: Literally a human golden retriever ? What is a Mary Jane Did you mean Mary Sue? WHAT What what is it I was gonna say the only Mary Jane I know is weed Like Guy? I will fist fight Jennings BaBu Aerin was a good villian Just he didn't feel like he existed just to spite the main crew. He thought he was good and had so much motive to become how he was. The trauma and being constantly overshined from his brother. People like Richards and Guy felt like they had no motive but to be shitty and weren't as complex It's been a while since I read BOLAS so cut me a little slack with this, but he was pretty much neglected by family in favor of Baulder (? his brother) and overshadowed by him (who was super mean/rude in his own right) And he's so messed up by it he goes evil just so he could be #1 for once I hated Landry more tbh Because he was a regular person and put people in danger with his nurse fiasco, while Aerin is in more of a fantasy land, which makes it less realistic and relatable With Landry it was more real because it was something that someone would/could actually do That's why I hate him more Aerin? People fucking hate Landry but cry that Aerin wasn't made an actual LI Because you can flirt with him What is pretty boy syndrome Honestly I never flirt with the bad characters So Poppy and Aerin That's what comes to mind immediately Oh I have When Twitter people discovered Tiktok :PleasePBJustStop: God Tiktok... I've seen the cesspool side of Twitter Trauma and abuse are the buzzwords HEY SAME HAT I've seen Bastien described as abusive Like a lot Aren't werewolves technically half/mostly human? I did see a lot of forest setting in screenshots Actually I don't remember seeing a city setting at all Why did Tarzan not have a beard :KEKWhands: :ohgodohduck: Haven't read it and sorry if this is rude, but I think it's mainly the super vanilla people saying it He wasn't bad to Lily no but he treated Harry like shit But he's still weirdly like...mad he's James' child Weren't Hermoine's parents decent? Well yeah but they're adults that weren't evil Just some dentists vibing God did I even spell her name right Describe it to me I'll probably find it through my massive determination It's millennials too Gen Alpha is still too young I think 7 year olds are called Gen Alpha, yeah Boomer, X, Millennial, Z, Alpha There's a Buzzfeed video I love about the generations. Give me a sec https://youtu.be/IfYjGxI6AJ8 I don't know if I'm Millennial or Z either. But if asked I say Millennial 1996 -1998 is such a grey area when researching you can call yourself that if you want Nah no way 2005? Absolute babies Sure but they'd be way too young to even remember Hello Server Grandpa I think, everyone that's a Millennial is an adult now My parents are X I think I got my first phone at 10. It was a slide phone. I think I only got it so I could finally be left home alone I didn't get my first SMART phone until 15/16 My Mom loved blackberries Last one in the family to switch to smart Lu I thought I was older than you? How old are you That's only 2 years I don't think I wanted a blackberry I didn't have any use for a phone really. Didn't talk to anyone outside of school until 15 Man fuck iPhones I've had my Android since 2017 Thin ice I'm scared to trade in because what if they get all my info What if they reverse the factory reset Do not have iCloud on Android I mean there's a Verizon Cloud but who tf uses that I'm using this phone either until it breaks in an unusable way or apps stop supporting it. I need my Choices Over 4 years strong LMAO Nokia is the ultimate brick Big Angel WTD energy Lu Phone I am eating baby carrots Nah I'm destorying them None I hate both hummus and ranch My first and only experience with hummus was at a Mediterranean restaurant in Pittsburgh Yes But I loved the pita Alone If you're all that and like it that makes me feel better about reading it thank you I'm more interested in THIS...Was it CH or ID? I can't remember but it looks like a woman next to TH:M MC The outfits I mean PB dropping a new book hint thinking I won't notice Either way it looks new. Vibes for one of them and I am very interested Honestly glad they're making a separate app for user stories. It's keep Choices at a smaller storage space for people not interested in that In b4 one of the first stories is an IL3 What do you mean by ports !!!! I am very excited I love new content :UmiYay: What's GG Nvm Odd, though The title makes it seem like a perfect Summer book I was fine with the name Isabella for SO long...then TRH2 happened :PleasePBJustStop: Ma'am There's literally no difference A het cover is a het cover That's cool I remember when BB3 cover came out people were like "this looks nothing like the old art what" Yeah that was my thing like They do know Adrian is also a vampire right With how creepy those eyes are probably Who is dead Gaius edited on to anyway Yeah it's him before he turned back to pretty boy UWU I can't remember the last time the ongoing book section was that full. Amazing God I hate this stupid wig so much Oh yeah Insiders is this week And that was only male faces. When's the last time we got new female faces? Not including non human. Those aren't regular faces I have 6 fingers left Never dumped anyone Been unsure yeah but never switched Wait that's a fucking lie LOL I switched from Naomi to Grant because I liked him better with my MC Not in the same playthrough When I did my diamond replay I chose him instead I cried after Endless Summer. Both times playing I can't replay unless it's been a long time. Like over a year. Otherwise I just remember it all and am uninterested I thought it was supposed to be Bastien in the icon? WAIT IT IS THURSDAY Still nothing? Man c'mon I think they forgot FINALLY Where is bottom from WHY didn't they do this while airing? They could have gotten more profits Isn't the second one that guy everyone thirsted over in OH :worry: Insiders today Looks like MAH might have themes of ||self harm|| And nothing new on the calendar except SR2 :samhelpme: At least they know we're fucking waiting and watching And don't trust them after the Great Cancellation Rucha Can u move ID please 👉🏻👈🏻 Thank you Mara :SadCat: As she should And why did they change Eli's hair WTD book 2 leaked Maria. My LI WTD and COP Literally like 😭 I guess She's the ghost of weddings past Are we surprised tho Who is the guy Who Is that a TPA I don't understand He's so forgettable to me If you want it to be But I don't see it. I think they're different sprites Just 2 chapters are out you're good No. I bet we'll get a holiday book Hmm I see it I don't know about that We played as the princess way too much like why didn't you just make her the MC instead Kepler ♡♡ Also black female Trystan >>>> Gorgeous sprite We share others too but Kepler and Trystan are two of my favs WAIT JEN MY LOVE I DIDN'T NOTICE HER Finally A man of taste JEN GANG I was gonna say it's something gay but MW is romanceless Maybe it's about a certain sprite Bel just tell us Oh my god she killed him I don't think it says but my guess is 20s to mid 30s
