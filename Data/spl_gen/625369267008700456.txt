i let tom die pff Hispanic Ian kinda looks like Hispanic Sam but that just might me be idk It might just be the beard and hair spooky scary skeletons aw yours is so cute om my 9 year old cousin watched that show  i am a bit biased towards women this is prettyhard did they forget to add raf because i cannot find him oh nvm im just blind lmfao thats a trafficking thing ive seen it on insta a few times :e_minor: :e_minor: i heard encanto is good too im a sucker for disney movies sorry a lil bit late but would #dfbdb3 be good? and annabelle parsons (from d&d) for the character (also sorry for the ping) pies? Spielerland pie only I married a dog and Im proud of it  NOO took away both the Wednesday vip books :l_whysob: its also on a twosday (Tuesday):smirk: then dont pay?? its going to be 8 degrees tomorrow.. woo.. me and my gf are critical  why are the choices ad's always the worst I picked Annabelle for my LI bc yes she was def my favorite out of them all I actually also really like D&D "veil of secrets male mc hot"  Theyll probably make a third book and it would probably be a wedding book NO :KEKWhands: those are going to haunt me while im sleeping tbh i thought they were talking abt wolf bride when they mentioned werewolves whos the one for september i havent played that book so I'm pretty sure it was mentioned that Rheya or someone else fed on vampires but it was just like looked down upon because its just gross I think during the party where you walk in on Rheya with all the bodies?? Like it mentioned some vampires being there? i might be wrong though because i havent read the book in a while i like the second one because it has more of the love interest instead of just adrian and mc i've only started playing this game in may so the first choices book i read was the nanny affair :SOBBIE: they release it weekly like TUH my only ally was mackenzie during ame Not surprising for TRR and TNA since when you first download the app those are the first two books you can choose between Now its choose, romance or steamy :kek: Wasnt that background used in TNA2 they seriously are holding off releasing the two best books to public (sb and mm) not annabelle too  Mal & Jackie,, :dogeheart: wait a minute. omg I hate those ads it wont let me do anything expect try and get me to download the app and even when I try I dont get the diamond :kek: omg finally its out damn PB needed a new royalty book after they ended trr nono its nick, ethans evil twin brother i wished they'd changed the app pic :petdoggoStare: for some reason my iPhone wont let me turn the app into a shortcut so Im stuck with the current one Also choices: puts nanny affair in the description Choices: baby bump ad these two books have nothing to do with each other
