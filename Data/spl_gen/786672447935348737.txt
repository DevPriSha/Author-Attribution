... what. that's a joke, right? If that's true, I really hope they work on the way they write those smut scenes. Same.   professionalism? not here. I hope it's not based off of what happens at PB's offices. If word of a romantic/sexual relationship between the LOA MC and Gabe were to occur, wouldn't that mean that Gabe couldn't be their superior anymore? He'd probably be ousted from his position. Feels like PB didn't take that into consideration. also what the heck happened to the choice of pronouns like in FA? Bring it back, PB... ew. no :((( fingers crossed! should've set it to they/them pronouns in FA :(( Are y'all able to see my pronouns in my profile roles? I'm not. Are you only allowed to have one set of pronouns on your profile? I picked two in role-booth channel Ok, thanks for the clarification. I'll request them. Are you a student? I think they're exempt from jury duty (don't quote me on that) If you can cite an undue risk to your property, a conflict of interest, etc. that should work as well. Or just pretend to be too opinionated, depending on the case. If you're full-time, that could work. ^ what does this mean? is it saying that once i reach a specific level, i get a new role? Ok, thanks. Just a heads up that Ill be leaving this server pretty soon. Nothing against anyone personally - just that its a) difficult to keep up with two servers related to Choices and b) I dont really mind not knowing spoilers ahead of time anyways. Its been fun while it lasted. I wish you all the best. Goodbye! How long after a chapter description is posted on the Choices app can we expect the script to be posted here? Understood. Thank you all for the replies.
