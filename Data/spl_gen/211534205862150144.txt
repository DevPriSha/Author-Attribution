i think the only fire confirmed to be from gender reveal is the el dorado fire in san bernadino the creek fire near me is suspected to be either arson or an accident with a campfire yeah the "fun" part is finding out how much of it is natural-borne vs human error it's such a downer that so many lives are getting ruined by this alone yeah i haven’t been outside in weeks bc i can’t handle the smoke and i miss it at least i could still walk in the mornings during early covid days the smoke is blocking the sun and causing weird weather shit :wut: in all seriousness can we try to avoid referring to characters as looking like terrorists? it’s a sensitive subject and can lead to hurt feelings and is potentially triggering to people this is why when people started harassing the ethan Ramsey faceclaim i was like “WHEN WILL YOU ALL LEARN” he looks like dane dehaan actually yeah someone told him he looked like a video game character and he went “oh you mean mario?” and then they told him about Ethan to his credit he seems to have let it slide Michael b Jordan did lol alright so i wanted to share a local news story i think is funny
so we have this sandwich chain in our valley, and they were really popular for making sandwiches with fresh bread and ingredients
as they expanded though the company started restricting the fresh bread use until finally banning all of their shops from using fresh bread so they could save money
and they still advertise as having fresh ingredients
so two of the five locations went "nah we're not lying to our customers we still are using fresh bread"
and they've been getting their own fresh bread to use
but NOW the owner of the chain is like "no, how dare you guys" and threatened to shut down the shops
but the two locations went "nah" and now the owner is suing the two locations to try and get them to stop using fresh bread under the deli delicious name and the two locations are just running business like normal and just completely ignoring the owner what i find hilarious though is that they're still like "oh yeah we are part of this chain and love it" and are genuinely just pretending nothing is happening while the owner is trying to sue them it's like "if we pretend it's not happening it won't happen anymore" my town may be a ton of california rednecks but at least we're unique damn it i've been thinking a lot about my diet and shit lately and i want to work my way back up to being a vegetarian again lately i've been feeling as if it's the only way to consume ethically not like with animals (though that's a bonus) but like with climate change, unethical business practices, the lack of safety in the meat industry, etc i could never stop eating tri-tip though it's not *just* beef ansh it's paradise in a sandwich or a steak, depending on how you eat it marinated in the perfect blend of spices seared to perfection yet tender on the inside no i just fucking love tri tip what state are you in? anywhere on the west coast will have it at all bbq places oh shit rip it's not really a thing off the west coast of the us like i lived in va for six years, no one had a clue what a tri tip was but if you go to california everyone here that eats meat loves it too bad they close in five minutes earlier i made peanut thai chicken and it was so good and i'm furious with myself for not taking pictures before i ate it ngl it's probably the healthiest thing i've cooked in a long time. i usually make stuff like five cheese mac or a pizza casserole or something it's not pizza but it tastes like pizza my pizza casserole is a zucchini crust with bell peppers, cheese, tomatoes, tomato sauce, and turkey pepperoni it's good but very unhealthy lmao i put parmesan, mozzarella, cheddar, provolone, and gorgonzola in it i'd put more but i can't afford more than five cheeses my rule of thumb is that the more cheeses you put in the richer the tastes become i'd probably give a real chef a hernia also guys as a tip always bake the mac n cheese, don't just do it on the stove @Metta check your clean air privileges how do you know my full name settle an argument please is madman two or three letters off of madam THERE CAN BE NO COMPROMISE WHEN IT COMES TO *COMMON SENSE* go to #deleted-channel vote b if you believe in freedom victory!!!! if we star this mara can never forget it mara is spiraling fiiiine i’ll go back and clean up the mess after lunch i am not royal, i believe in power to the people https://tenor.com/view/so-long-katniss-everdeen-jennifer-lawrence-hunger-games-three-finger-salute-gif-14042795 but yes i genuinely adore mara and i’m proud to know her 💕 y'all ever just explains why 2020's sucked lol backwards is still an order :smart: i hate my leg that part seems mostly over as long as i don’t irritate it but i think it’s gonna scab and you saw how big it is :ohgodohduck: oh god i know lmao at least i have a physical reminder that i am the local idiot i can't believe i'm in a timeline where julius caesar is on a wiki page for being the one that got away it's the pb  icon wearing a flower bonnet it does kind of look like it has a baby body now that it's pointed out i love it tho me and the girls pulling up in our grandma chic trousers and blouse, hair properly coiffed and ready to destroy the environment done both, i pick the sewer with the clown guy you can get both in the sewer fine i’ll take the hostel, i can have way more freedom with that when i was in that scenario i leaned into the rumors can’t gossip if I say it myself :smart: with ants pest control really is the only way to get a long term thing done i— my toast just *launched* out of the toaster it flew out!!! it hit the top of the cupboards!!! :yeetedtothemax: it’s not my house i just live in it 🤷 #yolo #shutup #mood #isthisspam bugs hate people nah but seriously how bad is it i had a house built on an ant colony once okay so you’re gonna have to clear your whole pantry spray everything with poison not the food that will kill you but the shelves and floor and such along with your counters try to follow the line and see where they are coming from there’s also poison squares you can buy and put in corners that draw in ants and bugs and kills them inside what is lovelink so like tinder without the risk of being stalked by a guy every day is a great day to stan firework hey guys, do be careful with this information. the point of this server is to be discreet, and if pb finds out about what we’re doing the whole community goes down and they restrict their scripts. it’s why oh scripts come out last second, for instance. the more people know about the process the more likely it is we lose our ability to do this if you know how to edit and want to help with the process/share spoilers with people, then ask to join the editing team and pick up a book to work on. we try to respect and work with each other and it’s hard to do that when there’s no communication 💛 i love heat i miss weather though here it’s always just hot and dry or cold and dry it might be so hot here because i am so hot who needs confidence when you’re beautiful also i feel comfortable with lesbian jokes it’s all good. i present femme so it makes sense 😘 i love seeing the sun again i wanted to cry from how bad it was YOU are comparable to the sky i am willing to become the new sun i’ve created monsters hayley love can you set this as your nickname and not username? no one will be able to @ you change your username back, go to server settings and select change nickname yes you’re good now 💛 admin chat rn DO YOU KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT IS TRYING TO READ THROUGH OLD MESSAGES ON MOBILE WHILE PEOPLE KEEP SENDING NEW ONES :hmm: https://www.boredpanda.com/countries-reimagined-anime-samurai-tokyo-olympics-2020/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic out of context that sentence is odd it’s okay torrent it still exists in my mind what’s the expansion pass i’m kidding also i have no idea what happened i just like making torrent miserable pri what was it oh do they know each other irl? whatev haha scepter’s icon never fit so well anyway stan me :PBSeeIToldYouSo: no just me i’m queen can we get back to talking about how perfect i am bc i’m Queen b get on my level peasants you technically can have fun voltra fight me firework 🔪 there can only be one i’m the cat on top what? what mc what? oh swell a unibrow is better than a tribrow that’s why i stan the rock instead it’s the witching hour here oh nvm that’s not til 3 am my b it’s just lame midnight this may be something better fitting in #🗣education-channel no worries, it’s an emotional topic she wanted to take a quick break

you guys aren’t in trouble, and this is not something serious so please don’t worry about her, but i want to make something clear since this has happened a few times now and now is a good time to say something directed for everyone:

it is not our place as admins to explain people’s personal reasons for not being in this server. when you ask questions publicly, you force us into a position where we have to decide if we will ignore it or try to explain something in a way to avoid breaching privacy. it’s not fair to the people involved hey guys, just saying in case it breaks out here, but please redirect anything regarding the trump/covid diagnosis to #😡let-it-go the cat from the screaming cat meme died :Dopeysad: thank u :animeglasses: ~~totally meant to sneak this in with the new emotes lmao~~ ~~this is what tom would have wanted~~ honestly tho if we got a cooking themed book that actually went in depth on cooking i’d be down i’m more of a cook but i’m trying to get more into baking yeah let’s do a cooking night i want it to be a competitive cooking show book we know we’re good and we will kick ass yessss we’ll fly you out here if you take my side i have wine and cheese ten bucks it's just gonna be scandal i would refuse to ever date someone who is part of the opposition party lmao i can't remember what i picked, probably politics or cooking eleanor and the blonde girl from roe arguably nia but you can play male :animeglasses: my co-star zodiac wants me to date the ghost of a long-dead writer so which one should i go for folks aight she’s on the list hello everyone ❤️ it’s okay to express disappointment but it def should not cross into bullying or violence like people are apparently pixelberry and story games like these tend to draw in a toxic, entitled fan base not sure why that is re: peacekeeper

i just woke up but please keep in mind that just because we aren’t speaking or have our status as online it doesn’t mean we aren’t present. in this case, due to time zones, some of us were asleep when the announcement was made and were not able to reply to questions

we chose to temporarily remove the peacekeeper role bc we felt that between the number of admins and mods, and the activity currently in the server, we were ultimately overmoderating you all. we chose to remove the positions so that there would be less restrictions for those that are still active. 

realistically, we are aware that servers tend to follow a tidal pattern in that activity ebbs and flows, and when combined with spoilerland 1.0 and the decline of pb’s stories and activity, we have been in a state of receding. as such, we felt that those of you currently still here were trustworthy enough to not need moderators constantly around and still follow the rules set in this server i’m working on part 2 of my race series on choices, and since i’m disoriented and unwell i wanted help listing off the women of color put into “unsupportive” roles to make sure i don’t miss anyone. so far i have:
xanthe
zoey
kiara
jackie
victoria
scarlett
the rival reporter from wt i forgot her name right, thanks oh just remembered aurora too i was going to include her with a caveat because of the long-running idea in fandom that she had to be the the villain, either as the person running the t or with the things going on currently there’s Lauren from mtfl too, forgot about her i included jackie bc she is competitive and much of fandom hates her for that oh duh, poppy 🤦‍♂️ okay i think i have all the woc that fandom consider unsupportive or are cast in an antagonistic role, does this sound right?
