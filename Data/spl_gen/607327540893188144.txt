wolf bride literally sounds like something I would have read on Wattpad when I was 13 I don't think it helps not spend, but I think it does assist you on how to prioritize when and on what you spend? I name them after me even if they don't look like me... just helps me with the storytelling. I have a unique name so I just laugh at the thought of the characters trying to say my name and failing. You're wayyyy to creative! I tried once to do all original names for RoE and I ended up confusing myself on who is who lol. I did Y names though. Yardley (Alex), Yvonne (Katie), Yohanna (Jess), Yolanda (Nicole) I do remember for like a handful of chapters I named the LIs Brad, Chad, and Thad üòÇ that's a good one!! It's working now! > Transitioned into house renovating
@unforgivablespelling  this sounds like a Lily‚Äôs Garden. They‚Äôre so wild. I once got one where she found out she was pregnant, told her husband the good news and he speeds off in a moped. Next scene she‚Äôs at the ultrasound and calling him and he‚Äôs having an affair. LOL. The final scene ad is her destroying the house they created together and starting to renovate it üòÇ Yeah! There's like 3 variations I've seen... if he's white it's a cheating ass, sad ad. If it's a male POC, they're faithful and happy lmao. Code not working for me? @baratiess Lol makes sense. I always forget we can switch that. Oops yeah. I got disconnected. I‚Äôll join back in when it allows me. Not sure which book they're talking about but I noticed it applies for the final of OH2 (we got to hangout with three of the roommates for free) and MM (nearly always two diamond scenes, max and one is always an outfit). RT as well. I think they're trying to fill it up like before having 2 book every other day? If the newly announced books take the Monday slot, wouldn't that be 2 Mondays, 1 Wednesday, and then 2 Friday's? TRH is close to ending right? It'll take that place I do like starting and ending my weekday with a book, so I agree it's annoying to not have Monday books. I think they're trying to schedule it in a way that'll keep players Also, I think someone had mentioned on Reddit that Monday was a cursed slot so the theory was that they didn't want to put BaBu there in hopes it wouldn't fail lol Was it.... ?!? LMAO let's start the week with some unnecessary angst and ||porn|| I love it PB. Keep it going. To be a fly on the wall of the creation of that book. I just want to see where it all went wrong > Also Arzaylea please spoilertag
@unforgivablespelling Sorry, fixed it. I've always wondered if PB sees the names we choose and store it in database for whenever they want to get creative. Like, is my name floating somewhere in the server Is the MC in Wolf Bride going to be *me* I would like 100% cry if PB used my name. there's no going back, everyone who knows me will know that it was not a coincidence lol Not really, but I'll be embarrassed that the entire choices fandom suddenly knows my name :ohgodohduck: > My dad‚Äôs name has been used for a character before
Is it a unique name?? Damn, Metta lucky. As far as series goes, that's a good one Imagine your name was used in Witness. Oof. Bad hit. But let's talk about the choices players named Ian or Bea.... they're winning the name lottery lol @( À∂·µî‡ºù·µîÀ∂) milquetoast ‚ô° I relate to this 100% but in real life. that's my grandma's name. It made me smile when I read it #exposed Who shares a name with ||badass|| Jocelyn? He's a hottie so not a bad one. How bad is it? If we need a sacrifice I'll be the one Yikes. Couldn't they even pretend with a Nolivia Oevrakis or something Olivia's natural lip color is stunning LOL Ruscovia sounds like an interesting blend of Cordonia and Russia. I am intrigued I can't wait to meet Paxwell or Blake! Damn episodes has kinda stepped it up since I last played.. why is your ex in your home Here's to all the Brody's who made someone reconsider their sexuality Wait, I am so confused. You're into girls but you're in an arranged marriage to Leo? That's where I got confused. You started replaying it. I was like where did half the characters go lol Can I say whatever banana powder Olivia is using it's working for her. Go off contour queen. Sounds familiar.... Woo! You‚Äôre up to date! Description: Bk6 Ch15.
Me: Bk1, Ch9 :niapanic: It's orville redenbacher for me Capitalism is finger-lickin' good go get it, spoil yourself clog those arteries popeyes a death sentence if you eat those biscuits without a drink I want to drive to the west coast just to try In-N-Out. I just want to see for myself if they're worth the hype. I have every fast food restaurant within a 10 mile radius from me. It's both a gift and a curse. Good luck with finals! I got an end of semester project is should be working on and I‚Äôm heavily procrastinating So.. reddit is removing chats from the communities. Interesting turn of events. Why is it interesting or why are they doing it? Apparently the mods are having a hard time doing their jobs and it's become very stressful. A lot of people, under the comments, feel that it's the best move. But they are moving the community chat and the people in them into basically a huge group dm with the mods being the host. Is it just me or does that sound like the same problem, different place. Its *indescribable* What‚Äôs the problem? Oh, it might be a software incompatibility. Have you tried downloading files from different websites Do you get the same error code for each? why does anyone ever blame "The Other Woman" instead of their partner Yay! "OH2 is being re-written" :kek: Cassian smiling through the pain: I'm used to it. Same I support jingle bels :smart: Wait who didn‚Äôt get the joke üò≠ Bluestacks? Did you update to Big Sur because if you did, they haven't found a way to bypass these new safeguards. You'll have to re-install back to a later version if you want to continue using it It happened to me too yeah, new update is incompatible. sorry I have no idea so flip a coin lmao luckily you were not far into the game or I would feel terrible what did the coin say? üëÄ Cassian definitely fits in PM. He's too perfect. Must be manufactured lol Justin from STD and MC from Witness deserve each other also... if anyone wants to report me in the other server and sacrifice me to the interrogation room, I'll do it. I can report back all the juicy details haha aw man, okay. I promise. I don't want to disappoint OMG nope. no. I promise I will not make any burner accounts. too much time and effort. they're not worth it. :marafrogemoji: Going back to the game... I think that Raleigh would've been a great Noah I would love to see it. Imagine BB MC with Jack as their LI. that would be a boxing match for the ages Witness MC vs Principal Jennings Sienna: quick, distract Ramsey!
Max: *breakdancing in the waiting room* Give us 10% of their funding and we would create ‚ú® magic‚ú® DO IT!! Kio, i love you, but your smart talk is losing me ü§£ I was romancing Fabien but every time Sonia appeared and talked her sexy stuff I would üëÄ Landry! Landry needs to learn the phrase *snitches get stitches* the hard way I'm mad I couldn't send a line-drive to his face Bryce: heads up!
also Bryce: I guess he really used his head. oh tell me more LMAO throw that ass in a circle, MC! Def ES. Oh you want fake answers only? Witness MC saying thank you for breakfast to Cassian for free a ||hoe|| don't get cold me at Forever 21. Always. didn't she wear a full slit leather pants for a fight? I kept thinking... wedgies Me. idk what you're gonna say but me. my friend gave me hers and let me tell you... amazing. it does go with everything from chic to punk in an instant fancy me too I want to visit so bad my friend lives in San Leandro and one of these days I am going to surprise her and then force her to take me everywhere lol ummm name? I am def telling her about this mwuah! thank you nope but sounds interesting lol. I love places with funky names its me. clam chowda fan. can someone tell me what an impossible burger consists of that is actually really cool I'm not a vegetarian but sounds like something I'd like omg not the In-n-Out talk again i really want to try it I'll film my reaction for all of you I feel so left out right now I'm packing my bags lmao the minute Ava and MC grow stronger PB hits that reset button was it that person who came in to say they were done with choices? I think they said they never finished it but that maybe one day they'll release what they planned I feel like it might be. If you added them as a friend, they said they are happy to accept people and continue talking. if you're that curious Yup, you're right Voltra. they did say that. LMAO yes that one person who was like "oh, weird for them to say that when they haven't been around" and I just laughed so loud because same, but also not same, cause they've been there longer than the two of us combined prob ugh, remember playing ES and thinking "this is it, peak of Choices" but then realizing it really was the peak I looked at male MC and think, yup, you totally are an alien I miss the panic of choosing between which two people I rather upset bring it back the CG in the first book when you go into the little spaceship thing with the beautiful glowing orbs?! to die for! and everything about the handfasting!! I truly feel that if PB takes on apprentices and interns, even just for the skills and education, they could go back to being amazing. for people who claim they don't have a lot of hands, their requirements for hiring is extensive as heck yeah, I was like wth? just hire some kids from college who want to learn and are eager to please! they know what we want! plus, it won't hurt having fresh eyes didn't you know Andie- we all picked up our rubber nose and face paint at the server door who is more powerful? Hero MC or ES MC the battle of the most alienest alien look at that, top 3 strongest all are customizable cough cough, PB I twerk to this the beat drops man I just have a twerking problem lmao catch me twerking at Landry's funeral thanks to Metta Oh god, its officially the 1st here. I'm not ready any idea of what time? I love karaoke LOL y'all def not gonna be on tune at that time *laughs in up at 4am* insomnia too its hard to fall asleep but very easy to wake up it has its perks. like my friend is a new mom and she's excited she can reach me at all hours of the day so she doesn't feel alone moving the chat here since I don't want to clog the channel with mindless chatter but do we know why writers left the team? I heard some went to other companies but that is really it I'm assuming they're contracted then they up and left after the book finished wouldn't that be counter-productive if they're the writers? unless they mean other team members? I could believe that... that they wanted to take it in a diff direction and they bailed cause they didn't agree I know nothing about their companies so I can't say what is good or bad about them but if the changes started midst of the change well.... facts are facts I hope 2021 is better for them and us I'll spam their emails until they hire each and everyone of you y'all make me want to take coding classes maybe I'll make it my hobby and teach you what I learn John üëÄ it worked for Penelope, didn't it I can help with the totally legit medical stuff LOL. I'd love to fun fact, we aren't all surgeons the problem started with calling them doctors and giving them specializations but never placing them in the right unit lol they do it on tv shows too. you won't believe how many surgical residents on The Good Doctor is seen doing MRIs or ultrasounds.... when that is not their specialization that's a whole other team dedicated to that and they're not even doctors! you'd be surprised how many people you think are doctors and they're just techs I'm assuming PAMF is a non-profit? usually F stands for foundation if we are speaking about hospitals still I can tell you what I learned the differences to be but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find places that don‚Äôt operate exactly like that Hard to weigh in when I am not familiar with them Does sound like an outpatient ME Toss in Phil of the Future and that was my entire lineup but then I would switch to Nick at Nite after 6pm to watch Drake & Josh, Ned‚Äôs Declassified, and then Zoey 101 and boom. Bedtime I liked Come & Get it. I used to get ready to that song Pumped me up I do!! All That 90s babies FTW omg Cartoon Network was lit I miss Foster‚Äôs Home, 6Teen, Total Drama, Totally Spies Dexter‚Äôs and Powerpuff Girls I honestly forgot that one Just remember a whole lot of futurama and the one with the food that talks lmao Tag yourself, I‚Äôm Sam. Sugar daddy üëÄ best humorous content would be Love Hacks and TRR lmao Cole and Max would be the best duo ever Horatio, Mark and Drake LMAO but in battle of the wits king Sometimes I wish I was more into Pok√©mon so I can understand Sounds fun Are you playing individually and versing like that or are you all playing in the same game? now I want sweets enjoy them! I want to make snickerdoodle cookies since I haven't in years and I have a craving but I'm lazy but you're motivating me I took a choices MC quiz and got Queen B MC Look out friends, there‚Äôs a new Regina George I can take on Poppy AND MC with my eyes closed lol The T will update you in the near future xx Metta stunting on us No surprise there... Queen is literally your name :dogeheart: Here we go! https://quiz.tryinteract.com/#/5c93eca25e6c6c0014f531a0 Hehe That was the quickest trigger of bot I‚Äôve ever seen lol Drew I made it to question 6 on pure guesses before losing. Proud of me? Sorry! I‚Äôm on mobile so I guess I didn‚Äôt scroll far enough. I assume Drew cause of earlier discussions I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing. I‚Äôm so sorry to everyone I‚Äôve bothered cause of that üò≠ Thanks I noticed it right after you said it. So much for attention to detail lol Don‚Äôt scold me üò¶ I‚Äôm baby I‚Äôm assuming in the annoying little cousin the way I‚Äôve been attacked Call me Violet now I bet Metta is a silver fox boom, roasted Metta!! Come in here and defend yourself LOL Guys, Metta won‚Äôt see any of this until tomorrow It‚Äôs past his bedtime Badum tss You should make it full time :dogewink: get that coin sis ‚Äò97 baby I use Swagbucks to pay for VIP. Try it out! You do surveys for money and then redeem gift cards I am a 90s baby Metta Be kind to me We are both in this together I occasionally still pop on Donkey Kong 64 just for the nostalgia I haven‚Äôt had a problem with them! Made $80 already But don‚Äôt use it if you don‚Äôt feel okay about it if we overthrow PB, could we become famous? Content creators BLASPHEMY Wait if you go under the listed it still says book 1 tho are you being funny? lol also my new badges are still stuck. its driving me crazy LMAO I meant the blue eyes part Drew sksjhjfbhfsa Just so my friend Drew feels better, I have green eyes and my niece has blue eyes. Just to flex our diverse eye colors ü§£ These are choices when you enter the app I just really want a Jurassic World inspired book I think it would be so much fun It‚Äôs amusing to know they‚Äôre trying to get the smut audience and appeal to them but if I‚Äôm being honest, the quality in their steamiest books is tamed not sure how it‚Äôs working for them cause there are much raunchier apps I'm watching the Among Us tournament and its crazy how some of these people aren't good I wish I could become a streamer and make half of what they make Yeah on Twitch they do tourney with streamers where they play 4 games in each map and they get scored of what they do its interesting watching them play and stuff, but I feel like I can hold my own on some I do have a twitch account but I never tried streaming. I‚Äôd need a whole setup Imagine that.. nurse by day and streamer by night Wait you stream?? Or just know about all that stuff? Damn, I wish I could join. My damn assignments are not giving me a break. Omg adorable. I love playing. I‚Äôd happily join when we‚Äôre both free I'm sorry to hear that she's been laid off. I hope things are going well and not affecting anyone hard. awww, that's the worst. what games did you play?? Hi! I think my battery last for maybe 5-7 hours on a good day but depends if I have bluestacks open cause that drains my battery hard. I always try to remember to force quit it so it would stop draining it. Does it charge fast? or is that also depleted? I can charge mine for 20 minutes and it goes back up to 60% around that time. Half an hour tops and it's fully charged. If yours is not charging fast there could be a problem with the battery on top of all the apps draining it Okay, not to spam the channel with more off-topic stuff but I need to know what sports team does the Cali squad support oof Oh, I know all that. I'm a fan I'm gonna be the basic east girl, but I support all the teams of my area but I like watching all of them. the only sport I don't watch is soccer. its just not interesting to me, but when it comes to FIFA I pay a little more attention yes you're the cheerleader baby same with men who act in plays. people assume they're closeted but all performances were male what in the world is powderpuff sounds like male version of powerpuff girls lol the way I snorted me me according to my peers in high school: total jock but dresses like a prep. my high school football team sucked after my freshman year and it destroyed my Wattpad inspired expectation of being the best team in state life can be cruel I would've launched a football at their head and that's on karma his peak was winning the sperm race LOL College is the best college is just a big building where everyone is just vibing this makes me feel so bad. I feel like I am in the minority that had a great high school experience and it sucks to hear about others hating it or the people there not exclusive to here, but other places people say similar which sucks. if you could choose one, go for college to be the better experience, but people should be chillin everywhere if I could make it happen if I told you guys what stuff we had in my middle school, you'd think I went to school in hollywood its so funny looking back on it my school had fights, people bringing weapons, leaked nudes, pregnancies, marriages, and whatever else you read about on wattpad OMG YES. WE HAD ONE TOO. It was called *insert city name here* exposed lololol ours was on FB. Twitter was not the rage at my time I used to read tweets of those pages. they were hilarious damn, back in like 2016-2017 there was one app that was filtered by schools so it was more secured but I forgot the name Metta, we had one of those too. Top of the class, Ivy League bound, came from rich family... ||he's now a meth user that has been convicted 3 times for drug possessions, intent to distribute, and warrant for other arrest.|| perfectionist parents is how It was. I always liked that pause where you're sitting by side and just see each other at what is possibly their lowest point and just giving them a nod like "it be like that" type of agreement. had you asked me 10 years ago what 23 year old me would be doing, I would've said raising her family. I learned that life was a joke when I realized that if you worked, you did not get to save your money lol. I didn't sign up for this. ah yes, Harvard. every kids dream school I wanted to be an attorney and then I realized that defending monsters was the bigger payoff and I said screw that omg I would visit the heck out of that bakery make me fat not Drew throwing shade with the reaction he first chose LOL I always said if I could have a job that I didn't need to rely on for money I would do interior designing. I like making houses pretty what would it be, if you did? like inspiration from what food I'm not familiar with those desserts but I like sweets in general so I'd try them all if offered near me imagine going into that ice cream shop and never being able to buy cookies and cream cause they're always out lmao you can't attack the shop owner!! what a dilemma Damn that easy? What are other perks of being in this server I‚Äôm gonna cash in Metta wishes we were that forgettable We living in each other‚Äôs mind rent free Don‚Äôt bring that negativity here what are your preferences with wine? do you like it on the bitter oaky side or more of a soft, fruity end? More champagne-ish? check out Vasse Felix Cabernet Sauvignon, La Mascota Malbec , and Chateau Palene Bordeaux Rouge. I made sure to offer different price ranges. I think all of them pair well with meats, but all range on different tones that could make or break depending on preferences my friend also said stella rose but I've personally haven't had it so can't share much a replacement or upgrade? I remember you asked about macbook battery life because you use it for work but Dell is HP I second that theory. Macbook is great and all but when you force it to do more than 4 things at a time, it can get funky hopefully the laptop comes back without any problems so the wait is worth it I've had mine for whenever the pro with touch ID is first release and she's going strong. It makes life easier that all my files on my phone and laptop syncs üòÆ yay!!! I like it, flipping through apps and pages is so much easier. also helps me do commands when I'm working on documents/spreadsheets easy Me in RoD: *zooming through the streets with Burger King fries on my lap* hell yeah there‚Äôs something about prioritizing meals before a big adventure that screams powerful to me I was going to say unless I pick you up and we get in n out before driving to this side... we won‚Äôt be able to Toyota family! I have to trade in mine and get money for a new one after I sell the one which is falling apart lol dopey, grumpy, doc, bashful, sneezy, sleepy and happy I feel like I may have gotten one wrong perks of VIP I love it Hi!! I submitted my last assignment. Now I get to be off for 3 weeks. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself lol Oof, I know that pain!! Hopefully you did amazing. You did your best üí™ Mmm I love the ones from Dairy Queen. It‚Äôs one of the best. Chicken strips basket! That‚Äôs my go to.  Decent milkshakes too A regular one or with the soda? Aka blackout Blizzards with the choco bits and caramel drizzle is the hype for my friends it‚Äôs promotional I think, haven‚Äôt seen one announced in forever, but it‚Äôs basically vanilla milkshake with coke. I find it gross but my family love it my resting b face is free and effective only during tax season Among Us has been released on the Nintendo Switch. This is groundbreaking lmao not me wanting to buy myself a switch now It‚Äôs only for $5 They know what they‚Äôre doing üëÄ I just went onto the store and saw they added the holy trinity of Mario games- 64, Sunshine, and Galaxy üòÆ Lmaoo I remember the rumors about it but they released it!! Damn. Those were my fave games. I‚Äôve had severe nostalgia ever since the cousins I let have my old stuff threw it away Oh man what did they do?? Oh damn. I haven‚Äôt heard of that happening but I remember there was drama with them through Twitter. That‚Äôs rough. Kinda see where they‚Äôre coming from but the second incident is very petty People really just wake up and choose violence What is it? Oh, I didn‚Äôt know that. Cool. I thought they meant the hexagon thing for the heads but then they said covers and I got confused as heck @DaHomieDrew I would like to think PB is smart enough to know the stability of the app would face problems with high-volume books since they decided on trying a daily release book. but maybe I am just looking through rose-colored glasses I think they make a lot of dumb mistakes but none of them feel like rookie mistakes, more just ignorant ones that's just being stubborn imo You mean you don‚Äôt just bury yourself into your SO‚Äôs skin? now that‚Äôs a level of intimacy I haven‚Äôt reached Lol I may be bias... but like Mario. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs al I have to contribute lol okay, yeah. Zelda it is I‚Äôm going to the store next week and buying the switch. Maybe I‚Äôll finally get the hype behind those games Will do!
Do you own any game cards or all downloaded?? I‚Äôm trying to learn as much as I can so I prepare myself before purchasing I was at Christmas Tree Shop shopping for disposable masks and while waiting in line I was on my phone since it was moving slow. I turned on the setting where if you tap the back of your phone it takes a screenshot. Well, I was fighting with my phone and tapped it since I was being impatient and the sound of a photo being taken was so loud it startled the people in front of me. A father and his son.... lol Pretty sure he thinks I‚Äôm a creep now The Reddit chat is all crickets after I called out people for claiming that Charlie from RT is privileged. Don‚Äôt use a word if you don‚Äôt know what it means I hope that this break sparks some life in them We stan you ‚ÄúHere's one of the reasons you can tell the book is written from a point of privilege. Business struggling to make money when the main source of income has just been killed off? Never mind that, just take out a loan for solar panels you don't need or won't help your business in anyway!

He wouldn't dare to let anyone leave him, no matter how toxic they are He needs a hug. I don't agree. Both sides have done wrong and this shouldn't be turned into a "who is the lesser evil" competition. lmao not us, we are just unwitting accomplices I am late to the party but welcome back Pri!

Hopefully our daily talks rubs off on you lol I should‚Äôve been there when Charlie was demonized I just want to be a mod so no one can take down Metta‚Äôs funny ass memes It‚Äôs what he deserves. I would buy a thank you card with that on it lol there is a Corgi among us @8emi95 you don't come across as underaged or immature, I just figured you were my age at least, but I do remember telling us you were 25 so I'm just being dumb Voltra talking about TE makes me want to play it now. but I‚Äôm supposed to be doing homework lol :smart: Shall I bore you all with a live reaction? It‚Äôs my first time. I‚Äôm making ribs. I can‚Äôt rn either But I‚Äôll post my thoughts in general when I start That is adorable Yes, back of my neck It's a capricorn sign and my father's DOB. aw cute! I want more tats but I haven't fallen in love with any new ideas I want something down my spine though Where do you want it? I want something on my shoulder too. Love shoulder bone tats At age 50 my mom got a massive rose tattoo on her chest/breast with a ribbon and all three of her kids names a the end of the ribbons she's wild I would refrain from ankle and top of foot for tat for your first unless high pain tolerance wrist is hit or miss too The back of my neck did not hurt but when it got higher it felt like i was tatting my hairline and it burned are you trying to say deltoid Paige where you get your vaccines on I got blue I didn't shade its a good reference but don't forget its subjective too I have 13 piercings and will do all of them again without a blink of an eye but the tattoo, I really want it so I would do again Ink color does not matter, I think they're just talking about shading. If you get colors, more repetitive motions on that area to get the right saturation which is why people who do intricate stuff do sessions Like, red, green and pink fade quick. You need to put a lot of saturation and do touch ups Paige, the megamind thing you want, is it a lot of lines? You can try a single line tattoo. That might be worth it Single line tattoos are literally that- the tattoo uses one line to design the entire thing. Probs least painful since its not repetitive motions on tender areas. Only problem is that you need someone who is experienced on it so it comes out looking great examples You have years to decide on what you want lol. When the time is right and you're in love with the design, you'll know. I forgot I have mine all the time. I love when people remind me of it Me: huh? oh... yeah I've had it since I was 18. I expected Metta to have at least half a sleeve or have virgin skin. No in-between How about a chest piece lmfao Do you have your ears pierced at least? Omg a bare baby. I love it. I have friends who don't have anything and I always ask them how it feels to not care about crap like that omfg hahahahahaha I have this picture in my head of what I think you look like and that comment might've just told me I'm right are you her friend or her crush lmfao that's a lot of opinions for a friend That is such a college girl thing though: Ugh, I don't like guys with ears pierced. Don't do it unless you want to look like Jerk-off Josh I love guys who give off that cocky, punk vibe. If he got the fit, I got the eyes LMFAO MY NIECE'S FAVE shsjfhdj great point of reference Never forget Vinny leaving the shore house for mental health and just bulks up and gets a chest piece I love Jersey Shore. I stopped watching the family vacation after the wedding but they're my guilty pleasure Jwoww and 22. I hate it. She's an idiot. My friend and I do random binges of the entire show on Hulu and just laugh all over again Deenerrrr UM, HELLO? ARE YOU DUMB? THE GRENADE WHISTLE I will never not laugh at the scene when they blow the horn and the Sitch is just like "shhhh, shhhh... wait, do you hear that?"
Pauly D: GRENADE The girls: *fighting at a fancy restaurant*
Pauly: so.. *clasps hands* how was everybody's day I love this man. Les-be-honest... god, when I was in middle school this is all I would hear from annoying boys No, its Pauly D he started it with Snooki and Deena babe Jersey Shore was years before Pitch Perfect lmao https://tenor.com/view/lesbihonest-lesbehonest-gif-5543107 That‚Äôs a good idea lol I hate being in a serious convo and then I level up But it‚Äôs also kinda funny as if my anger/sadness leveled up as I got more invested in the topic Me: I effing hate it here.
Tatsu: Arzaylea has now leveled up
Everyone: oh, she‚Äôs hates it, hates it. Aw, have you checked out any school discounts on laptops? It‚Äôs obviously nothing grand but it does shed a few hundreds if you find the right one üëÄ go get those marks!! I am looking into upgrading my stuff so if I see any good offers, I‚Äôll send them your way. New England is group of states on the east coast. It‚Äôs a region and I‚Äôm just used to saying it but I can see why it‚Äôs confusing. I live in Massachusetts No love. Are there more east coast question y‚Äôall have lmao dude I cannot type for my goddamn life today Shdjdjshshsj it‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat happens in Vegas‚Äù but east coast exclusive I mean, I could easily drive to NY and be back by Midnight That‚Äôs one thing I will miss about living over here if I move to the west coast. How easily I can travel across states in one day You‚Äôre talking about the country that has New York, New York LMAO PRI I love that you said that cause I was going to make the joke about how in elementary, when kids learn states, everyone goes ‚Äúis there an East Virginia‚Äù Ooo try it SUCCESS We are your minions Promise just cause ily :CharmanderHi: Keep it for the flex Power through it babe! Good luck! I dislike when I take Nyquil I get a sudden burst of energy right before the sleep hits Yeah, same. I hate how disoriented I get from it but also... I need sleep so here I am I just know the book Drew is voting for book club In spirit you are and I know your vote It's almost 3:30am and I am sleepy but not enough for my body to make me go to sleep. we love insomnia Yeah, I was offered meds but I don‚Äôt want to become dependent on them. Hate for the need to rely on them every night Yup. I‚Äôve actually started playing some chiropractor videos softly in the background when I try to sleep. It‚Äôs worked for a few nights btw. Kinda like ASMR I haven‚Äôt. This is the first I hear of either of them to help but thank you, I‚Äôll be sure to look into it I did get some sleep. I usually nod off around 5am and wake back up an hour or so later. Do you get paid for it at least? a bonus or something? yeah, no thanks. give me the green lol at least when I train someone I can take the day off and make them do all the work and get a nice little extra cash for the time I can relate to the appreciation you won't be bothered in the future about how confused they are Happy birthday!! He looks like a brunette Justin Bieber The disrespect I wonder if PB would consider doing a daily release book but for a holiday book. Just a simple 6 chapter book of the week leading to the holiday and ends on day of/day after the holiday. If PB weren‚Äôt cowards they could do a mini book for pride parade. Full of representation. I wouldn‚Äôt trust them unless they spoke to the community of how they can accurately depict it Bring in some irl stories Sorry babe. I said mini book cause I was thinking of it just for pride week. I would of course love for them to do a full on book with the works for all of you to be represented. Just making sure none of you thought I said mini book cause you don‚Äôt deserve a whole trilogy. How awesome but complicated would it be if the bidaily release was two in one? AM focused on one thing and PM focuses different but similar Add in all the token LGBTQ+ characters galore Imagine a book where you have the option to have a baby and MC goes: how about a dog? I would SCREAM. Yeah, but I kinda felt like it wasn‚Äôt to break the heteronormativity of having kids but because they just graduated college and ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt experienced life‚Äù yet *cries in poor* Welcome to the super fan team hey now don't flex on us Lu still can't ping WB its a mess literally cannot I tried 5x I thought maybe cause I don't have the role but even searching I couldn't access it This is so chaotic First time using light mode Look at all the colors lmfao I don‚Äôt know what that is but sounds like it could be... fun? What would I do? Screenshot what I wrote lol I‚Äôm busy today so I can‚Äôt do it but I probs would any other week I‚Äôm not busy I love writing and love learning I don‚Äôt know how people sit at a desk in their home in professional attire everyday. I dislike it so much lol I was thinking of you when I said this. I‚Äôm here in a collared, knitted sweater with my hair and jewelry on ready to start this interview so I can rip it all off and get my back in pj Thank you. It actually started early so I finished right now lol. It was stressful. It was me with a panel of 8 faculty/nurses all asking me questions about why they should accept me, what would I bring to them, why do I want to be here I felt like OH MC at the hearing I think I said what I needed to say to represent myself well and to get them on my side but whatever happens, happens. Thank you so much! Hope everyone is having a lovely day! rip Well they‚Äôre wrong lmfaoooo I love that energy As they should Focus on the POC established LI before the prissy ‚Äúwhite‚Äù girl Shit you‚Äôre right. but I did pre spoiler I wasn‚Äôt surprised but I also meant it like a state of mind Mhm. I did see redditors lose their shit when their realized :OOF: I can already picture the comments I used to read multiple books at once but now I just commit to one Bless your brain lol Not like they left us much choice Gimme back the MWF format you cowards :kek: Good luck with the job hunting! Don‚Äôt lose hope! Do enjoy your time home reading. I miss it so much. I think every year or so I give TC&TF a re-read just for the heck of it. I live in MA and we got restrictions again. We‚Äôve got a rise in cases I feel your pain Stay safe! WAIT did they confirm it died??? true idk I feel like they aren‚Äôt ready to admit it I will show up at their office with a pitchfork if they tell me Hero2 won‚Äôt happen I will personally fund that damn book myself Bet. This is what my stimulus check is going to- funding Hero 2 Drew and I will break in as janitors They taught us how to do it in a couple of books LOL what does free form mean Someone please apply I just got an amazon package but no one told me I was receiving it and I definitely did not order it its so cute, but like who sent it to me lmao stop lmao. if that‚Äôs the case I appreciate the gesture but I‚Äôm messaging everyone in my contacts to ask which is kinda weird for all parties involved Yeah, I‚Äôve asked 5 people already and none of them sent it. :hmm: I did open it when I got it cause I am dumb and didn‚Äôt think of the dangers of it. It‚Äôs a personalized stainless steel cup with my name on it. Amazon I thought if I opened it, the packing slip inside would tell me more info but it‚Äôs an email address that looks like spam. A string of letters. am I in a movie? is this the part where the electricity in my house cuts off lol it‚Äôs all wrapped up and I haven‚Äôt unwrapped the plastic thinking there‚Äôs something inside of it :kek: I definitely will do that. Not at all! I got a few more people to ask if they sent it and if I still don‚Äôt get a confirmation, I will be contacting them. I found out who sent it! Crisis averted If I‚Äôm not barefoot, I‚Äôm in heels yup, only fb I think that they don't want to be bothered by everyone switching accounts left and right so the deleting situation is the better choice I haven't ever been able to oh wait you mean from the store itself?? or still modded then, yes I thought you just wanted to keep the modded, which is not possible. If you just want the game, normal download of the app it works is your email in any form professional? My suggestion was going to be to pretend you used it at work or something and that you won't have access to it cause most schools/jobs disable accounts after someone leaves. Just say that it said email not found and see if they believed that I only say this cause I've used old emails from school for an account and its been closed on me No, error messages are no-no. I have an old college email that is still active with my challenges feature on it. I wonder if I can just link that account to my fb. Problem is, fb is currently my modded with over 2k diamonds so is it even worth it I meant ask them to do it lol with the whole, graduating excuse I feared that Uh, I meant from google to fb. But, yeah. I thought that challenges might be lost during the transition which is the bigger loss PB knew what they were doing when they rolled out challenges to my non-fb account. Big brained my ass. Emi, go offer your services to PB for compensation. I have two of them, I'd totally give up the email if you want it. good night üôÇ ‚ÄúBeckett, he‚Äôs sweet and I liked him but he looks like my brother and it scares me.‚Äù üòÇüòÇ ‚Äúpoppy (qb) her chemistry with mc was written so well, the whole hate-romance dynamic really came through and i loved it. i'd love to see if she gets a redemption arc
Poppy Min-Sinclair, because her and MC would rule the world together.
Poppy because I want to help her be a better person
Poppy, because I'm a useless simp
Poppy (I'M SORRY)‚Äù This is sending me to hell and back :kek: People lack taste. Not surprising. Aside from that, not everyone gets a redemption arc. Some people are just asses and they‚Äôll forever be one. Hmmm who? Name a character that deserves one. I‚Äôm curious And name one that did but didn‚Äôt deserve it Drake got one? lol they tried to jerk down the aspect but then shows us the aunt that is a total biatch and traitor I can see what you mean. I never saw it like that cause I was just over him. I was like ‚Äúoh here is the sad man with more sad man problems for me to pity‚Äù nice try PB Yeah; that shit doesn‚Äôt work at all. Especially cause they like them is when they forget to include backstory and actual redeeming qualities When I played AVSP I saw her sprite and I immediately groaned I literally said ‚Äúnot this again‚Äù She was nice, hate that I had to win her dumb butt over but it could‚Äôve been way worse I love Max, but what was the reason of considering him before Olivia? Especially when it could‚Äôve even out the LIs proportion to 2:2 I don‚Äôt think they ever thought it would‚Äôve been this long lol. Definitely failed at making it a multi-faceted story with handful of LIs that all come at different points I love that Metta got into the starboard but I hate that it was in reply to what I copied from Reddit lmaoo Those weren‚Äôt my opinions LOL Omfg I said Drew cause when is that boy not on my mind oops I would‚Äôve gone harder I already know I would get rejected if they see my old comments arguing with people They clearly went to Edenbrook with a concussion and are still showing symptoms lol Real talk, it‚Äôs so shameful that you see the list of favorite LIs and it‚Äôs full of females. PB is just insane for seeing the positive feedback on them and how much they‚Äôre cherished and ignoring it. Step your game up. wait, really? üëÄ not even med school, no student is able to enter a classroom where they‚Äôre held to a different standards than their peers. the lawsuit would be ginormous The Heir needs to be rescued. I‚Äôm not offended. Saying louder for the people in the back. and they allow people to insult POC characters It‚Äôs so disgusting seeing the crap under fb posts PB called out people who were defending Ava romancers because of the homophobic shit people were spewing And if they come for you, you have a whole community here who will defend you. Drew as in our Drew. People were bashing Ava and calling it disgusting and forced and he called all of them out which started a whole argument. PB made a call-out post about negativity in the comments and making people feel like shit for who they like and won‚Äôt stand for it. All because he was trying to stifle the ||homophobic|| shit Hi Drew ‚ù§Ô∏è I agree 100% Pri. I seriously meant it when I said that we need to start skipping books that are problematic. The minute they see that non-fb moms are a big community than they think and we are protesting, they‚Äôll change their tune. Yeah, Lin Phan posted on IG the call out post to him and literally name dropped Drew about his ‚Äúnegative ways‚Äù and how maybe he‚Äôll learn to stop attacking people. AS IF. like listen, disagree and be upset about whatever you want. The minute they doxxed Drew I wanted to throw hands I think so. Lmao @DaHomieDrew you still got the screenshots? It‚Äôs the privilege for me Fb moms: he supports LGBTQ+ AND hates TRH? Blasphemy! #cancelled If it ends in -ist or -obe, keep it away from me. Me, an intellectual: King shit. Humor is embraced :smart: Isn‚Äôt like every take out food option in choices: lo mein, curry, or burgers like where is the variety?? Do you want us to make it up? Lol I‚Äôm confused LMAO They said all these applicants fucking suck :kek: Subjectively speaking, I have to agree :zoeywink: I mean, I can be seductive but only if you ask politely LOL They looked at Metta's bartie memes, my one and only post was about if Ava and MC had lesbian sex, and Voltra fighting people on MasterChef subreddit I think you're more passionate on MC WELL ofmkdhhd what was it??? actually, don't tell me Hiiii Okey I love AITA. I‚Äôve been there a few times. Always a good read lmfao same. always a good one I remember before those subs, we have fml I used to read those like it was the newspaper The IG account that leaks sprites, outfits, and whatever else Changed their google drive like 3x because ONE person kept leaking it Fam, there‚Äôs a block button. it's private now, I think. I had to request access you're right though, not because of PBs warnings but because of leaks lol Damn, I want to see this one. Sounds funny is BP just TRH but in Las Vegas? wow a trendsetter lmao Look at you! Also, charge your phone lol I am binge watching Criminal Minds. The episodes still hit me in the feels the 6th time around. GASP it‚Äôs soooooo good I‚Äôm watching Hell‚Äôs Kitchen! Just finished first season!! The first season winner was an obvious one to me. I didn‚Äôt have to plot it out tbh it's not purposeful! I am just really good at it lol. Although horror movies I let it play out cause its fun, mystery I guess cause I like being right I knew who it was because it mimics the Scary Movie spoof of Scream. Like glaringly obvious NO omfg its just my habit, a bad habit to some, but in my family it would be a competition. we just theorize out-loud during mystery movies and see who got it right first I continue it despite some HATE it. See, I don't get that feeling very often. I have not played all the books but I don't think I've been shocked by any discoveries? You'll have to jog some of my memory for specific scenarios you're thinking of Yes SOOO, we are in the wrong channel for this lol but yes, Pri. I did ummm.... Metta, what are you waiting for? actually, scratch that. the diamond stuff is so annoying stay away ..... like out of the blue? yes! I don't eat them, but they are for sure a thing there's also pb ice cream I've been meaning to play all of them but I stop in the middle and start a new one... so I am halfway through book all the books I have not finished lol I like binging a series tbh. my brain short-circuited for a second is it spooky? Biden: Don't tell me things can't change. And this is where I burst into tears. oh that is me my entire life but as a I grow older, I realize that there is no reason for it cause what will happen, happens btw Emi, in the health talk, its why I said my experience. I know different places have their own way to handle the topic so I just said how it was for me in school. no cameras in my school and no student harming a pregnant teacher but seen that stuff other places. shame you saw that Is that because of personal stuff got in the way or because you‚Äôve just drifted? If you feel like you should break it off cause you‚Äôre just not into it, you should. If you want to work stuff out, definitely go text them cute!! LOL HAHAHHAAHAHAH Pri, charge your device! Dear lord cake = booty more layers to the cake = the bigger the booty You got it! :partay: did the professor like it? Aw that‚Äôs a cute surprise for the morning ITS BACK HAHAH It‚Äôs the dedication and organization for me College is a whole other world. Universe, even. Bel, I can‚Äôt with your puns today lol It misses you A king. :MunchlaxMunch: https://tenor.com/view/movie-night-movie-time-pop-corn-eat-intense-gif-17272497 Pri do be chaos HI Not the full name lmfao WAIT When did I say my full name? I know I probs did but can‚Äôt remember Deadass? Mood. you‚Äôve said my full name like once, I remember. I know why Drew knows my name and why I know his. But that was purely accidental I‚Äôm not sharing ü§ê Viv would share her social security if she had one lmfaooo bet https://tenor.com/view/will-smith-suspicious-gif-9651614 I did. I do recall. If there is anything I learned from starboard... is that Metta laughs. A LOT. How rude of you to not share I laugh way less than I type it. I‚Äôve been told I come across very... dry? standoff-ish? so I add them in to soften the message I have a really good sense of humor but I don‚Äôt always laugh. It‚Äôs weird. Like I‚Äôll smile to show you I got the joke but won‚Äôt actually laugh You let Metta hype himself up I am not an admin but this is my excuse PRI WITH THE JOKES :kek: that actually got a good laugh out of me irl be proud no debatable please do not have her bring up what happened earlier lol ~~logs~~ Well Metta and how many times he's said CURSED you react with bartie a lot, but do use the frog more often "no spam" I'm calling it don't spam uberbot she says uberbot every day stop' search stop wtf Pri we both gotta do work now say bye to your friends no but Me Ouch :kek: How can I help you You can tell me all you want but I won't listen :zoeywink: You may kick me whenever you want let's do it baby, I know the law Settle down gramps, don't lose your breath! I know what you were threatening me with lmao calling Metta a grandpa is sad cause I am close to his age. So, that makes me grandma in the making Closer than all of you he's like HSS dad and RoD dad blended together we love to see it please read it for him he is a blessing Pavlov is the scientist that conditioned one subject to respond to a stimulus, the same way, the same time, to prove that once the stimulus is removed the response is still there nah, it makes sense but its a different type of sensory response both habitual though most people urinate with the sound cause it allows them to relax since they don't like being heard how not the place lol this is a lesson that's a channel? don't got the role for that I did not know it existed lmao I was gonna say it but expected only you to get it Pri, am I blind cause I do not see it oh its not linked its just blending in with the text that is why Yup there, I set an example for the kiddos Thank you! Now go to bed Go to sleep Goodnight its also bigger naturally nursing has programmed me to use TNR, size 12 not me losing the challenge feature on my apple account only for it to be replaced with a worse one LOL my apple had the 20 diamond completion and got replaced with the 15 diamond Wow, I wonder why the global rollout now? Maybe cause of the small release schedule? Ouch, that 25 version had got to hurt. Sorry for the progress issues, haven't had some myself but I see them all the time on the sub and fb Aww, did you update Voltra? try signing out and back in STFU I would literally rip my hair out. The extreme high and low I just felt reading this, but for you must've been at least doubled might kick in a little later? yeah, it used to be like that with me fbhjsdad even when PB isn't trying they still make pronoun errors hahaha VOLTRA LMAO Not Voltra going Karen cause she wants the perks Emi, that is totally understandable. I wouldn't risk it TELL EM BOO wait what book were released when you started playing? I know for sure I had to wait for TF3 Install the update over it Yeah... I have Apple Beta on my phone. It's bad and good, but I will happily join Choices' app shitshow just to see what they give me maybe we can finally share diamonds like they've been keeping I think she means the update newbie wait yours still glitches like that? if I unlock chapters and don't play them, mine will ask me to use a key but won't take it Petition for PB to compensate Emi for all her grievances even when you're losing, you're winning I tried that when I accidentally restarted MTFL on ch99 but it did not work Sorry, I don't. I'll let you know if others share BULL I CALL BULL the way I would go off on them yeah that mod got it too and then I put the update over it, and that one got it too a n n o y i n g tell them the exact version they might just say wait :bartiemad: you only get the free key once yeah, you get one free key as a reward Yup. :partay: my brain is not working and I'm writing a paper that is analyzing pending bills and need to give pros and cons someone tell me what words I can use for the headings for the view that either support or contradict headings, as in the title of the paragraph title of paragraph aka headings: introduction, evidence, results, data, conclusion... stuff like that. y'all listing transitioning words but thank you. ily :partay: finally! I suck at it and autocorrect still doesn't like me this is exactly what I thought the future would be like CODE RED THEY FUCKING DID IT "After a great deal of consideration and discussion, we have decided that officially these series will not be getting additional books: Most Wanted, Hero, Nightbound, the It Lives series, The Elementalists, Distant Shores, and Ride-or-Die." My discord is quite literally crashing rn Neck of bottle or bottom part That‚Äôs expiration cause its not that bad? it takes actual months to expire its sealed lmfao I like your description of a vending machine I was teasing you it just makes it flat when its past expiration if you uncap and it fizzles, should be good. but smell it and see if anything inside looks weird ~~just have poison control on speed dial just in case~~ KIDDIN it means I am confident you will be fine But Daniel would I do, he's cute and has a backbone The day they admit that there‚Äôs no script everyone realizes they ain‚Äôt shit so they can‚Äôt. Literally so many people would up and leave. It really is that easy. Tell us how it would start, plot points, ending. That‚Äôs all we want to know. It was me. No James original sprite. MBJ is what she‚Äôs asking Was the angry face of the sprite scary Cause Tyler‚Äôs angry face is freaky weird MBJ angry face looked like a scolding dad Leak the scripts and let us go crazy on ao3 LOL Their requirements are absurd. For graphics, writers, or producers. They‚Äôre all too fucking bad. I don‚Äôt got 5+ years and I work at a hospital and am responsible for ones life or death But PB thinks I need 5+ years to write a book Gtfo ANYWAYS. PB, just tell me if Hero MC and Caleb are endgame Black eyed peas: I wanna rock, I wanna rock yo body,
I wanna go, I wanna go for a ride, Ayevah I did too but uberbot be on one so I just ignored it I am struggling so hard to write this damn paper it's due tomorrow at midnight so at least I have some time good luck, hope you get it all done soon! I think female Asian ES MC had green eyes White sunkissed MC White MOTY MC I was debating if it was green or gray but I wasn‚Äôt sure. I have green eyes but like on the greener, hazel side so ones that isn‚Äôt a shade off of blue would be great to see lol I finished my two part project and I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself I feel like they wanted to make it tan but didn‚Äôt know what shade would look right and they didn‚Äôt want to do the Kim Possible lips either I took a shower earlier today to get ready and put on my professional clothes thinking that when they said they‚Äôll contact.. it would be through Zoom, like all other times. It wasn‚Äôt. I did all that for a 5 min phone call. Problem is, now I have to submit a photo for background check and I need to take it myself. Now I have to shower AGAIN to do my goddamn hair. This photo will also be on my badge... it‚Äôs why I gotta look good. sounds like doing the budgeting managers job rip off Metta, you have a Masters? fucking lit I'm gonna earn my Masters degree so I can out-Masters you Ugh, I wish but I also don't want to write a dissertation we did mock ones in my Associate's and I hated every second gladly lol You can't, Voltra that is abuse respect your elders :Bonk: :marafrogemoji: HE NOTICED :CharmanderHi: it almost came off Meh brb indeed Welcome! :partay: It is very nice to meet you (again). Rae is on here. Always hearting my positivity posts ‚ù§Ô∏è Niece calls me at 3:30pm to ask me if I can drive her to GameStop cause she needs a new PlayStation card. I tell her let me finish my errands and I‚Äôll take her. She goes ‚Äúokay, but it has to be before 6pm‚Äù and I ask her why and she tells me it‚Äôs because her membership ends at 6 and so she wants it to stay active. I say okay, give me 10 mins. Tell me why she goes ‚Äúoh.... okay I‚Äôm gonna shower show then‚Äù Like fam? You worried I can‚Äôt take you in time but you still gotta shower? Kids, I tell you lol :smart: Anyone else feels like PB should release WEH as a weekly release? There's barely anything in the lineup, why not fill up a slot for a couple of months? I get the wanting to force people's hands into purchasing VIP but I personally believe QB would've been the better choice I understand not wanting to drop the sad book during the height of the BLM movement, Trump being an ass, AND the pandemic all going on... but WEH is a good book. enough to make many spend $15 to binge it all in one day? I don't think so WEH was well-received. I'm not saying its not, but in comparison to QB, I think most would choose that one. but how many books were ongoing at that time... TF, TRR, It Lives started? LH2 maybe? damn good guess on my end. that is when a whole book release to entice VIP is great humorous, creative, knowledgeable that's a title lmao Likes Dark Textboxes where is that and why is it relevant omfg no I read it like a new book is shaping to be the same my brain is literally cheese you = the netflic show?

I can still play an entire book even when at 0. Is that not server sided? I just found it curious how it's kinda the same format as Choices but completely hackable More raunchy. The writing isn‚Äôt horrible but very Wattpad trope and relationship stuff- CEO, Bad Boy Millionare Some cute outfits and hairstyles but nothing amazing. Since it‚Äôs fan-written, it‚Äôs better than Episodes imho LMAO I‚Äôm sure they have those too The Boy Next Door, College Rivals, etc Book 2 is MC realizing she can‚Äôt be President cause there is a hidden clause about *insert dumb reason here* a la Royal Romance Book 2 is all that but it‚Äôs during MC‚Äôs Bachelorette Party :kek: :zoeywink: shshdhsh this is such a fever dream Honestly, I would love some small little book that are completely ridiculous or just humorous and it‚Äôs a crossover of stuff I‚Äôd take them in alternate universes too they need money and I just want to have a good time reading Bet!

Or did you search it up? Cause you‚Äôre actually good at it. For conversations Yes? pero why I want to hear Metta do double r's its the way Metta is a better conversationalist in Spanish than PB I DO i got white friends, my ears are strong they're gringo-proof is it Metta trying to roll his r's? smh that's mean Pri he's doing his best singing? lmao maybe she's humming it's the way he flexes it all the time we love Metta at Coachella but did you find your car? its a win for me Next time Metta goes to Coachella, I'm going too so I can find him I wanna know how he dresses lol Pri, you haven't told us if your mom is sleeping or not. sleepwalking?

Nice! I once had downloaded an app that I could set people as my emergency contact and it texted them that I did this with a link to my account. needless to say, I scared a lot of people well, I just had problems at home and it was common enough where they received that text they thought I was in a middle of a situation. I have no brain today. I forgot I had a pizza in the oven and was planning on taking a nap lol I only realized cause I got hungry and thought to myself what I could make Nope, it looks good. I like my pizza crust crispy so it works I like a good crunch Night biscuit that's what I named my horse in TRR Mara leak your search history to prove you wouldn't lmao is hail freezing rain seems philosophical enough for me "its only for now, it'll change" I don't believe in giving/receiving false hope and it leads to people to expect hard times to end on its own and not take charge in life. you can definitely build something like a questionnaire before using to learn which they prefer makes it more personalized and effective some people prefer the encouraging words and others prefer actual solutions, make it tailored to them oh of course, its hard work and you need to build up to the features the more users, the easier it should become with feedback and all if you need a beta user, count me in üòä this is really important. its not an alternative to professional help, it is an assistant in how users can help themselves and have the resources to do so. are we assuming its been updated? cause I did this the first time they rolled out the update until they fix multi-tags, it'll continue to not show all Top 10 Bel, I need a favor I wanna see if daddy drew can marry me djsjhs ....

I turn it up and it‚Äôs too hot and I turn it a notch down and it‚Äôs too cold idk why I‚Äôm struggling I sleep with a huge comforter but I have 3 windows that cause a draft in my room and a heating vent next to my bed It‚Äôs a mess It‚Äôs 21 degrees where I am rn This is normal you‚Äôd be correct That‚Äôs nice weather. Not sure if you like it though I like the heat but dislike humidity It‚Äôs stifling I want to do a cruise. A Caribbean cruise. but I also feel like it‚Äôs not enough time for me to go to the places I want to go My sister went on one and tried to take me but I was in my last semester Indonesia or do I suck a geography? Cool! if you live in the states, it‚Äôs so common. I mean, they teach us the world map incorrectly so the map they show us isn‚Äôt very accurate is what I mean Flex it babe I suck but I‚Äôm not dumb. I have a general idea LOL its kinda sad but I know all the urban/rural areas WHAT ok I can handle that mistake lol I thought it was like an honest answer Firework, I can't ping you but HI! ooh, fun!

I've had a ton of broken hips which sucks so bad femur is like high trauma stuff. Yay Bel! well deserved My friend said something similar to this when I read this LOL hi and welcome! for someone who loves attention and posting screenshots, funny enough she didn't include one for this I'm thinking its like a Buzzfeed thing where they ask randoms in a topic/demographic to help out. anything concerning her is :judgeyfroge: the lin phan person anyways, that is the most backwards, unprofessional email I've ever seen so..... *whistles* it was the "no spoilers" for me I would only hope this is real just for PB to hear about it and put 2+2 together oh, I really like that emote probs with all the drama that went down they thought this would help them out? make them look less shitty? its very vivid, idk it pleases my eyes lol I don't think she is capable of thinking rationally I can only guess what *she* thinks @redhood310 happy birthday üéäüéâüéà @Priyudi so we don't spam the channel.... but yeah! some places are more strict than others but the actual program/classes are so strict. I have my hair is layers and when I first cut it short, my hair would poke out of a ponytail and they deducted me points for my "unkept hair" that was not to the professional standard I wanted to kick ass. It's stuff like that which caused me to hate my curly hair growing up. I always thought it was unprofessional to have it done... wild and crazy is what everyone calls it. I suffer from migraines and tension with ponytails and stuff like that aggravates it obvs guess who always has to have her hair up :kek: I really shot myself in the foot I plan on losing weight and then chopping my hair down so my round face can slim out a bit and it'll look good undercuts are so nice! I saw a vid of someone who got a pixie cut and undercut üòç I could never. pros and cons for everything I like volume, but its h e a v y Hope all went well üíï @Priyudi get ready to answer all my questions cause I am officially off the clock.

It tends to rip the paper so I open up the stapler ends in the back with it (just pull it back) and then turn the paper over and slide the teeth under the long side and it should come out seamlessly I‚Äôd literally buy a plushie of all the animals Money well spent. I only eat dry cereal cause I don‚Äôt drink milk subway surfers is great. My go to game when I‚Äôm bored. Angry birds is already great but only cause I‚Äôm competitive and want all the stars Goodnight Pri! I am off tomorrow and I can help you shorten sentences if you‚Äôd like! You know, I‚Äôve been told this but I have yet to have a job turn me down for my hoe pics and all my accounts are public (Please do not take this as advice to overshare and be reckless on social media) It does... but like I‚Äôve worked in some major departments that look all parts of your life. No one has ever cared about that stuff but then again, a good and hard worker for a pic showing my tatas won‚Äôt kill them lol I mean I‚Äôve worked in the most public places. My patients follow me on my social media‚Äôs at times Let‚Äôs not talk about how they find me.... unique name has its pits they do. I‚Äôm a reflection of the company and would get fired for anything I post I can‚Äôt even speak to other companies without informing them At least, that‚Äôs how the hospitals I‚Äôve been at Because society thinks it‚Äôs cool and ballsy Go on Twitter and you‚Äôll see KISS?

I hope it goes well! Yay! it usually doesn't load on phones cause its an ad and those usually run at different areas when on the website its a weird thing I didn‚Äôt get the nerd comment? That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt respond lmao I don't think nerd is an insult, back then it meant lame, now its synonymous for a studious person being studious and interested in being knowledgeable is not nerdy, and people usually use that term because they're jealous/envious that someone has the motivation or the brains to do well this is not teasing and seems closer to bullying/harassment, if you've told them to stop. I would talk to them personally and express your discomfort and continue up the chain if they don't listen it is, but once you recognize it, you gotta defend yourself babe. its sad but some people take advantage of friends and pass it off as friendly banter... you need to voice how you feel and make sure you're heard and wishes are respected don't do it if you hate shortcuts its so cringe its not... the three second delay to switch from shortcuts to the app to open up? hell no Drew, you don't deserve rights lmao how the heck did you decide to do half the job? voltra, what??? I am so disappointed rn do it for all the other folders lmao its like 8 clicks total my shit luck those 2 are the most important. I have to be up to date I'm that busy and that nosey duality my notifs are all important/priority inbox my promotion folders has a lot but I don't have the app screaming at me fae, I get the notification to look at it but not on the app itself with the number count idk how I did that but I did work is always outlook adulting oh bby, consider yourself lucky.  college and work use it cause its the most professional apparently I meant to reply to fae but y'all kept typing and it made it yours sdnfjhbkfn that's why I said bby LMAO I think its a glitch on discord, Drew. at least when on the computer it doesn't matter which I highlight, it'll just do the next one me: bby
metta: ..... alr? moving on STOP METTA funny how I'm honorary cali squad but not in the gc hmmmmmm I c, I c I said what I said lmao rip Metta nvm, i'm not into it he can handle all that never that boo Lu is mourning she's the most active today than she has ever been this week cfjngSKDL I had tears in my eyes from laughing at fae's reply djfhgsk a trip to MA is nice, to live here it is not just go sightseeing and enjoy where the celebs like to dine and wine go to some games alright, its been fun but going back under my rock I go love you too Mara and I got some beef Mandalorian LMAO that was instant Idk why people acting like they understand where that came from but go off It was the Massachusetts joke! I live there and it was a harmless joke about not wanting to be here lol Can you try googling their station and finding a number? The station usually has a line for tips and other stuff when cool things happens and maybe one of those people are kind to help random question but how does one go about getting a roommate LOL where do you even place the offer what if you regret them how do you just trust a stranger I learned from Drew that young people don‚Äôt read newspaper anymore üòÇ Like he made it very blatantly obvious and i find that wack I know Craigslist but do people actually use it? I always hear about it in memes I said Craigslist first baby boy, check yo eyes and then respond to me üíã there's a hack you can do to override that, in a way, but it takes a few steps and its risky to your account if you're interested askdjfgh yes I use it and it hasn't failed me yet basically you make purchases for more diamonds and boom I just do like one-two huge purchase and then don't do it again until they all run out so I've been under the radar you download lucky patcher, download the mod, go on lucky patcher and create a modified patch, click the emulator and LV something, click rebuild, and then use it through lucky patch app and should be good to go hold on, there's a link I use when I forget the process https://www.trickyworlds.com/how-to-use-lucky-patcher/ works for chapters and choices cause I'm a good researcher oh baby, do I got news for you maybe you chose the wrong options when modifying? its easier if I watch you do it, but the link I posted up there gives you the run down. when you modify, be sure to select the one about emulators and LV. switch the side tabs on and it should work LMAO That‚Äôs so me I put on light makeup, my cute top and do my hair I love it Hospital food made my stomach go brrrr I genuinely forgot about my foot for a solid second I was like, oh it‚Äôs kinda sore thanks for asking? Weird how you guess that üòÇüòÇ it‚Äôs okay! The area where I stepped on class doesn‚Äôt hurt or anything. I also stepped on a splinter this morning at 5am and wanted to scream I have wooden floors and when I re-arranged furniture it must‚Äôve carved the floor That‚Äôs what I think is how I got the splinter. I‚Äôll remember to be more gentle next time Hope school is going great! Especially work!

I‚Äôll push you Ruin what‚Äôs left of my knees I can't do that to Metta, who else is gonna be old with me? if its unfair criticism it can go to bullying territory right idea, wrong execution especially when repetitive @Belbercike it literally kills me that I can‚Äôt comment on Sophie‚Äôs channel.

I didn‚Äôt need a cat when Bel and Fae were providing me content Bel just slackin rn Not letting me sprout my words of encouragements to all their cats Damn Drew you writing a poem or something? SAY IT I embrace stupidity as long as it‚Äôs wholesome lmao damn straight Fae be awesome like that. Cat snap 24/7 üíñ unrelated but this just suddenly reminded me of Voltra being so confused as to why her bitmoji was on your story üòÇ I was dying reading her confusion I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the last snapped or the most frequent snaps But it was the ‚Äúwait, that looks like me. WHY IS THAT ME‚Äù üò≠ Your FBI working hard Lmao My agent thinks I‚Äôm a freak My searches be outta pocket Flag this one for being too gay to think functionality -5/10 You and Damian would be the best homies FBI agent jokes :) FBI agent jokes and the parents/God tweets after a kid does something are peak comedy Twitter be killing me Drew‚Ä¶ crip or blood? LMAO I KNEW IT My boy needs to be a little more street smart :/ Blue vs Red. The thing you sent had the bandanas repping both sides üíÄ ay dios not the Ricardo wave *in* that emote never fails in making me uncomfy the doge one, not the child lmao I am the definition of PG :nyansmilebig: https://tenor.com/view/true-agreed-jennifer-aniston-thinking-hmmm-gif-14692854 ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Welcome to nursing, morning meetings every day do you get treats though?? coffee, donuts, bagels? lmao, I'll UberEats you a snack 'World's Best Accountant' mug You can if it‚Äôs a chocolate mug If other streamers aren't messaging them or tagging in their own playthrough and stuff, that's kinda on them if someone has tried to get the same attention and PB just ignored it, that's where I would pop off on them. I do think there some contract/publicity thing going on here but if they're both benefitting, power to both deadass!!! I was watching masterchef jr and they did that for one of the fridges I was baffled at how weird it was what chapter is it currently on?? idk why I thought it was at ch12 that shit going slow Lmao I think it‚Äôs an honest mistake. I think she would‚Äôve giggled to herself at it or just thought you were funny cause you thought that pregnancy was an illness üòÇüòÇ Usually people are told to be on bed rest because they‚Äôre having some complications or they‚Äôre to prevent such issues so saying sorry to hear isn‚Äôt the worst thing. The please take care is solid. Don‚Äôt stress If it makes you feel better, I‚Äôve definitely told people who handed me my take out order ‚Äúyou too‚Äù after they said ‚Äúenjoy your meal‚Äù lmao I expected the typical ‚Äúhave a good one‚Äù and just answered automatically instead of listening to what they said LMAO Really? I feel like expecting is the more common, formal way to say it. I wouldn‚Äôt just tell my boss ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pregnant‚Äù, I would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting‚Äù. It‚Äôs a mix of preference, relation, and what‚Äôs more common where you are/grew up expecting or pregnant? If I was a maternity nurse, I wouldn‚Äôt say that. Depending on the situation, I‚Äôd say ‚Äúpregnant‚Äù or ‚Äúhaving a baby‚Äù You can‚Äôt leave it up to interpretation, gotta flat out say it. In front of them üòÇ I like Apple Music because it gives you the b sides/singles/side albums that Spotify omits. I appreciate it cause it‚Äôs usually those songs that are the true bops Plus who doesn‚Äôt want free Apple TV for a year? Some of the shows are quite good bbyyyy Metta likes to party with his tomatoes You heard it here folks I got mcdonalds upset tummy no I don‚Äôt like burgers just fries and nuggies I never tried the original sauce What‚Äôs it taste like? Its also called a blackout in some areas who we tempting üëÄ I know lol! I like the name we have insomnia cookies over here and they‚Äôre really good I do on my computer! I put that shit in a corner and let it roll I play modded so I don‚Äôt lose any diamonds by resting it in the edge of a diamond choice. So I let it select itself. Your other option is just saving you some taps if you only go in to confirm diamond choices which is like 10 taps out of 50. every person using excel Metta I will throw you in a trash can d i s g u s t i n g EST!

If I take Witness MC, make give her my background and go from there... that's self-insert fanfic stuff so I can see how its a fine line between just taking inspo and actually wanting to be them Witness MC vs Flynt. The crossover I need. Witness MC.

I have insomnia lmao The only exception is when I‚Äôm sick and I don‚Äôt consider that sleeping in, it‚Äôs more like spontaneous hibernation You‚Äôre a half cursive writer too! my friends used to always like that I wrote half cursive and had all the loops and stuff cause it made it look fancy üòÇ either they‚Äôre talking too long because of stuff or they‚Äôre just thanking those who actually attended, instead of everyone who sent gifts. My opinion is that it‚Äôs easier to remember who was there VS who wasn‚Äôt, so maybe they personally thanked everyone who showed up but haven‚Äôt gone through all the gifts yet so once they find yours, they will send it then. That‚Äôs what I see happening. :kek: I love being on top This is my moment. I am Poppy before Bea SKDXJJSJSNS Aw, I love that the day Metta learns to not send screenshots that looks straight out of inception I learn peace drugs without using the drugs :SansFingerGunBrows: :samhelpme: :heheadrian: :aislame: :GabeThink: :garbryce: :partay: :samwtf: :SONIAWINK: @Priyudi she‚Äôs risen ellooooo you don‚Äôt know Pri This is lights out go Sleep have a great day babe Awwww ‚ù§Ô∏è Love that for you I obviously haven‚Äôt ate there the fries are really bright, are they usually in the underdone side?

Allergic reaction is severe Metta lmfao bringing back the shart who wants to wet their booty after liquid poo Sounds grossssss wipes are after everything not the first time! god, the lack of butt hygiene you wipe with toilet paper and then wipes yes that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs second. It catches the messed up parts And the little leftover toilet crumbs üíÄ We eat greasy food and are obese! It‚Äôs taxing to take a massive dump! So they‚Äôre resting! LMAO Not American, can confirm weird. this made me chuckle. Good one. you can wiggle your ears and try to unclog it Helps me I can move my jaw and it pops it Not my entire jaw you fool! I can do it without moving it but it was the example to get the idea across I love watching TMJ resets That‚Äôs your last name Mr. Dumb Ass. I use Qtip but I also have self control. Quality tips. Metta üíÄ Why does my ear have a phone? chrome? lmao I call them both. Depends on which. Phone in my head and chip in my arm. Call me Robo-Lu We can agree on ear plugs Ears don‚Äôt speak which defeats the phone. At least with head you can argue you use one to speak and hear I actually don‚Äôt really care but if you want me to argue my side I will. I love debating. both that‚Äôs me I think arse is better ass- my friends call me this cause I‚Äôm being annoying
arse- holy shit I‚Äôm being a douche bag and this fancy person called me out on it arse just has a certain ring to it It‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt rhyme in general üíÄüòÇ lu likes laughing alliteration it‚Äôs a statement. He did it last night Past tense He‚Äôs Synjin? LMAO METTA Truth. He was always there to help and made me laugh with his antics Character from victorious Presidents teeth! bitch I‚Äôm Hispanic. Don‚Äôt correct me. El es Synjin and that‚Äôs it. His-peace? No! I‚Äôll be his-pain! Jade. you won‚Äôt date for long but it‚Äôs a good time while it lasts üòÇüòÇ Nah. He was toxic. Imagine going about your day and your bf comes in to rile you up and then act like the victim He flirted and crushed on Tori, and hung out with her despite knowing how Jade felt. He was baddddd I am a Jade apologist. She would yell and he would stay quiet. Toxic. I‚Äôm under my bed, I‚Äôm under my bed! SEE! You made Cat faint! and a dog that mauled his dad it‚Äôs the patience he had with everyone else but her bro, pls Jade and Andre was what I wanted. It would‚Äôve been a great balance. Beck needed to stay single She always had patience with him and even when she would be annoyed by him, she would be tame üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I really wished Robbie would‚Äôve realized that he put the girl on a pedestal and it was all in his head. she wouldn‚Äôt live up to his standard I think it‚Äôs his alter ego umm.. I haven‚Äôt watched that but think of like Freud‚Äôs Id, Ego, and Superego Oh so then yeah. It‚Äôs def that. Think of when kids blame their toys for their actions! Just like that I didn‚Äôt do it, Mickey Mouse did üòÇ ugh don‚Äôt talk about dan I don‚Äôt know her actual name but the actress from Zoey 101- Nicole. If everything she says it‚Äôs true, the poor thing went through hell. just cause of the creep She came out against Dan for SA. She said when she talked to the other cast members, they ostracized her for wanting to do that. They would exclude her in everything from hanging out to just going out for meals during filming. She basically said it hurts seeing them so close and connected when they did the reunion because they shoved her away for speaking about what she endured The roommate, ditzy one. Boy crazy. they are also like ‚Äúwhy would you do that? He gave us a career and takes care of us‚Äù Which is fucked cause if they didn‚Äôt suffer, you‚Äôre victim shaming. If they did suffer as she did, now you‚Äôre just hindering her healing. Hollywood is filled with them so having those connections covers your butt. You need people willing to expose you and if he has his other victims playing bodyguard, it‚Äôs so hard. Not to mention, at the time of the events, you‚Äôre not thinking to expose but to get away as fast as you can, and if nothing is documented‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just your word against his. I‚Äôm sure they risk being blackballed and even lawsuits you gotta be mentally and physically strong to go through all the hardships especially with little to no support defamation cases are big with SA reports. but most of the people know turn the other way are reaping in the benefits. Money, big gigs, A-list shit. They aren‚Äôt being victimized but they are getting the hand me downs of being associated so why would they throw it away? You just gotta have morals. And Hollywood always tells you to make it, you gotta sell your soul to the devil I knew of trump cause of his show and cause he was fucked since a long time ago He was always problematic. A true white man in America. I left for a couple of minutes and I‚Äôm so lost How did we get here lol SA, to anti vax, to this is a hell of a trip I‚Äôm here for it though! That reminds me I gotta finish HSS never did either of them ‚Ä¶.. can I be alien Lu? Move aside Martian Kat, Alien Lu is here PB would love me cause I hype up their smut They‚Äôre like YES!

Can you post a screenshot? why is the HT LI‚Äôs headshot so large You scroll down and it‚Äôs BOOM, in yo face lmao I can‚Äôt find them üòÖüòÖ I am trying so hard rn He doesn‚Äôt look sad?? yeah that‚Äôs what they do Abyss was gonna start WW3 ranking ALL of them You haven‚Äôt played a lot of books but I respect the ones you‚Äôve played tbh This tier is solid I like your diversity I‚Äôm binge watching You s3. Oh how I‚Äôve missed you Joe. OMG IS THIS NOT THE WILDEST SEASON? Also‚Ä¶. Theo ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm a Theo stan they can save them but sometimes only accessible to subs If you‚Äôre not a sub, you only see live Money things The ones that I watch post for their subs on twitch and have a YouTube channel where they put it up Best of both worlds. Subs can interact on the actual twitch channel but fans can enjoy the entire segment I felt the same but then I realized -in the one person I watch scenario- subs get opportunities to play with the streamer + friends, giveaways, etc Makes it fair for your money. Pretty sure it‚Äôs under $10 which many would consider a steal I agree. At my age, it‚Äôs not worth it. If I was 14 and didn‚Äôt know why to do with the monthly money my parents gave me? Sure. Why not. my parents gave me a monthly allowance Think of it as a little courtesy tip for all my traumas Believe me‚Ä¶ I was not tightly compensated my dad wasn‚Äôt very there when I was young since he was providing for the fam so that was his way of making things feel ok then he left and it was like a‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt leave *you* üòÇ I got a dollar Lost enough teeth for some fancy dessert VIP then upcoming/ongoing wow, I love being a bad bitch What are the new features?? FINALLY THE SHAREPLAY I did see that. Not sure why people need it lol Sounds like kids pretending they‚Äôre where they are kind of feature I‚Äôm going to Google the safari update cause idk if I have it oh is that where the tab is the same color as page I like that Helps remembering what I opened what with. Damn, not many things I don‚Äôt have :/ but I‚Äôm always happy to update It‚Äôs to make android users feel left out I know it‚Äôll work great on young people Imagine being in middle school and you‚Äôre the only Android of your friends so now you can‚Äôt join their calls? The only reason I switched to Apple cause for the device compatibility. I loved sharing my files across devices for work/school. That‚Äôs it. Didn‚Äôt care about the brand or anything now I own iPhone, MacBook Pro, and soon to be Apple Watch üíÄ random change of topic But I LEAVE WORK IN 1.5 HOURS woooooooo! anyways, back to Apple yes. software is great I had an HP for 9 years and that shit lasted for so long. My MacBook is holding strong after 4. We shall see MacBook screens suck though. Slight damage and suddenly the graphics are all wonky I don‚Äôt celebrate before I walk out cause in the hospital things can change fast but I‚Äôm feeling good rn‚Ä¶..



Famous last words. iPad sounds great, but it just isn‚Äôt for me sounds great to doodle on but that‚Äôs spoiled of me I‚Äôm mad. I wanted to get the new iPhone but it‚Äôs back ordered til December. I told myself that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll get an Apple Watch instead ITS BACK ORDERED TO DECEMBER TOO They just don‚Äôt want me giving them all my money Presale was to receive it in October. Demands was so high they are making sales now to December Apple Watch would help me so much at work. Some scrubs have tiny pockets so having the Watch to answer texts and calls is great plus I want to grt back to exercising and it‚Äôll motivate me to link with my friends and be competitive since that‚Äôs the only way I exercise üòÇüòÇ I order from Apple 99.9% of the time since their device coverage thing works best that way. I decided to try and having my phone carrier since j want the watch with GPS+cellular but they didn‚Äôt have the watch I want And to upgrade I use phone carrier Right!!! Apple care all the way I left Pri and Metta talking about Apple Care and return to Pri trying to scare half of spl into leaving No one ever expects you to read the ToS is there to cover their asses. So smart but dumb on their end. ToS was always there. Just doing a reminder blurb to added changes doesn‚Äôt change anything that they already know. Or us If I was them, I‚Äôd have a bigger problem with someone watermarking their copyright vs the ones sharing. they know, they wouldn‚Äôt care for what I think. untouchable type of mentality PRI GO TO BED. And sleep. are you nervous for tomorrow? sounds like it If you can‚Äôt sleep, just lay in bed with your eyes closed. You won‚Äôt get a full rest like sleep but it‚Äôs better to calm the body down and relax so you get some kind of rest staying on your phone will keep the brain stimulated which will lead to you feeling tired during the day worrying just means you care Did you study hard? Satisfied with what you did? Why is it coming separately lmao Then you have me with an Apple Watch in my cart on Oct 28 and it won‚Äôt arrive til Dec 16 rip I love online shopping but only from credible places If I get a gut feeling from a website, even if my friends and family bought from them, I won‚Äôt shop. It took me so long to trust Venmo and online retail (clothes) Amazon is amazing. 100/10 Never had a bad experience I can rave about Nike/Best Buy and their services on black friday Totally my go-to spots what does you being 20 have to do with anything lol also, does the other person have to have Mario Party for this to work??! Happy birthday Bel!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I read this fine and it‚Äôs such a mood Look up Brad Mondo‚Äôs tutorials! Makes it look very easy with step by step instructions! must me nice I do the same all the time but some aren‚Äôt good with bangs so I trust myself and my sister only lol unless I pay big bucks for professionals Wispy is the best! I call them peek-a-boo bangs I‚Äôm in this weird state of tired and ok. Barely got any sleep after work so I‚Äôm just hazy nah, thank god. Off until the weekend I only got 2hrs if sleep. It‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm waiting for this damn appointment I guess my body doesn‚Äôt want to miss it I still have class and hw in between but doing those in my bed beats the commute to work haha! Happy Diwali! May the world bless Pri and I with some good sleep tonight Yay! I hope you enjoy the goodies Ethan Jonah Ramsey ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è @Akuna Matata It varies with people, but more often than not light colored eyes are more sensitive to light. I forgot the entire science behind it but pretty sure its cause we lack the pigmentation so we don't reflect it well you suffer like me. I'm assuming your eyes are hazel.. which is the more dominant of colors? my eyes are dominantly green but I got the yellow, brown, black specs in there. blue is random for me, not very often mine change with my mood and more/less prominent with what I wear we love a mood ring bitch LMAO color eyes + rbf gang gang Large tooth comb is best for curly, long hair (aka me). It‚Äôs less damaging and actual hair tear. If your hair is better damp to do so, use detanglers that way you save yourself from dry, itch scalp and also less washing that also leads to damage Changing the way you wash your hair and how you care for your hair during sleep all helps but I‚Äôm gonna be 100% honest.. that shit only fixes 15% of my problems lol. It‚Äôs better than nothing tho all hail superbee üêù ‚ù§Ô∏è I work during this change my 12hr shift will now be 13hrs its getting so cold too quick I don't want snow :( we've hit 35 already' we just got here nah we had the small fall of wintry mix and I got so sad I was not ready to feel some hail No bueno only thing I like about this weather is the still air very peaceful I never played any of these games.

Me: Imma be honest with you chief, he ain‚Äôt even soft‚Ä¶. I have so many my title rn is COVID queen Yup We are supposed to assign patients to a nurse that is doable. If the patient‚Äôs are ‚Äúheavy‚Äù it means we need less patient‚Äôs because they take extra long. Well, I got two COVID which means gown up completely, do everything and then leave but x2. Heavy enough and then they have me two other patient‚Äôs, one that was already a heavy and gave them to me lmao. I didn‚Äôt complain because I find it ok but I def could‚Äôve swapped. The unit manager looks at the assignment during shift change and she goes ‚ÄúLu, why the hell didn‚Äôt you tell us you were doubled up on heavy‚Äôs‚Äù https://tenor.com/view/lauren-london-gif-18603761 No I don‚Äôt have to and I don‚Äôt want it tbh Moderna is the most effective so I‚Äôm chilling Yeah, I read up on them before and I felt confident on that one Fortunate for me, I know others didn‚Äôt have a choice I was highly selective. Here, we signed up through the state website and then they pull up a list for all facilities doing them and it listed date, time, location and type. So I made the arrangements I‚Äôve heard the same. My coworkers had minimal symptoms with booster Good luck babe! Enjoy the yummy food after Loveeee Thai I had Japanese yesterday SHIT. You‚Äôre gonna take the best food nap bitch same here I hate all of it ALSO NO PARKING I am dropping big bucks and for what? To walk? Mood. I always said living in Boston would make me a skinny bitch cause I would bike everywhere But the winter‚Äôs with snow? Fuck that. I ain‚Äôt walking. PRI per year?! PLS It‚Äôs just where we live. Other states are super cheap but you gotta sacrifice you‚Äôre gonna pay less, cause everything is less pricey, and you‚Äôre prob gonna be in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania is a good state. I loved the open fields and seclusion of living deep in a forest area but all stuff were 35-40 mins away. Food, hospital, etc So beautiful Ohio is a little less beautiful but more busy lots of condos imagine every morning you  catch your boss picking up the morning paper and scratching his butt I would move. I‚Äôve always commuted to work so I‚Äôve never had that problem Although, I def saw a lot of my professors everywhere does he try to get you back üòÇ how kind of him damn! Any time I run into old bosses they ask me how my new job is It‚Äôs like a * measuring contest me: you can have me if you give me perks My benefits rn are super good though. I‚Äôm getting paid the most I‚Äôve ever had (my new grad rate is higher than seasoned nurses elsewhere), my entire BSN is free (no tuition, no books, no fees). There‚Äôs no overtime cap as long as your scheduled hours is legal. The employees medical plan is average cost for a decent company. I‚Äôve transferred my 401k from previous jobs which I already invested 7ish years in. In terms of matching, it was pretty spot on. Percentages were a little bit more in my favor here so I keep more in my paycheck but I think get about $10 in difference could be better but I would‚Äôve cried it the percentages went down the drain, even with all that I‚Äôm making Roth IRA baby The way I see it, a country that offers you greater success is a potential risk for a great downfall. you win some, you lose others. In my ethics course, we talked about how humans lack imagination. We can talk about a perfect world but make no work towards it because many truly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs achievable. We also learn through racial habits  to be competitive. If I‚Äôm good, you‚Äôre bad. There‚Äôs no room for us both to be important or valued. some solid shit I made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm prob gonna be a horrible parent because I‚Äôm destroying all my parent‚Äôs/culture values and power dynamics. My kids are gonna suffer with my trial and error but I don‚Äôt want them to experience half of what I did. Even if it did make me stronger kids don‚Äôt gotta prove they‚Äôre strong. Lol, my cousin‚Äôs hate me cause they want to be me and my siblings and I all have our own battles. If you think I‚Äôm a bitch to you here? Speak to my family. Way more ruthless with them pls this is me 100% I‚Äôm glad I was taught at an early age about the scam of loans I‚Äôm living stress free on that regard. It‚Äôs hazing IIRC I‚Äôve read on it before we have hazing all the time Someone in a frat died over the weekend at some novice ‚Äúfight night‚Äù held for charity He was only 20. we didn‚Äôt haze, we just dared a dumb bitch and the dumb hoe would üòÇ cliques are everywhere if we‚Äôre being honest wow, how amazing I have all three I truly peaked at life üôÑ ‚ÄúExcellent student‚Äù and ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù I did all my work but make jokes.

Do you have a Mac? hm that‚Äôs weird. The only glitches I get of that variety is if I play on my phone and Bluestacks. It‚Äôll ask server vs device load to remember what was last played so be mindful of which you choose so, you finished ch6 but have to replay it now? Is that what you‚Äôre saying. it should‚Äôve prompted It always asks me so server is mobile. Device is Bluestacks if you finished on Bluestacks and want to continue from there, always do device. If you want to reset to what you last did on mobile, mobile is the way to go That sucks but now you know! I once reset an entire book lmao Hi :xBabySmile: It‚Äôs easier to just play on Bluestacks (inconvenient cause I also play choices on my phone when on the road). So your choice, if you‚Äôre good at keeping track what book you played and which device, you can load progress right with the risk of a random glitch. It‚Äôs up to you Np! Gotta help you get to completionist inconsiderate fucks continue to play, maybe you find some secrets You've got a lot of females on your list.

Bel, do you understand the emotional and psychological trauma she's faced? Honey needs years of therapy to be better and she just got removed from her dad's influence. Not the media's, or other family member's. that is why I said I hope she's happier and more in control of her life. she won't heal til very long. I know, it's why I explained. I'm glad Jamie Lynn seems to have shut up. I just don't like how it ended lol any show that makes the "live your life or choose your crush" trope just rubs me the wrong way. she's a major pick me bitch rn it's just with the Britney stuff people said she's her dad's minion and she went the victim route so fast change of topic but I read three trashy ass books in 3 days it's been my bedtime routine. you don't wanna know lol just very quick, trashy reads. think I've read over 6k pages in less than 72hrs per book HERE IT IS: Alpha (1), Beta (2), & Omega (3). it's not ABO. promise. the titles are just labels it's Mafia cliche really want me to answer that? Everett- Alpha
Ethan - Beta
Reagan - Omega I can go into it if anyone cares, trashy mafia. depending on my mood, I can switch Ethan and Reagan. I linked my library card to Libby so now I got all these books to read from the comfort of my bed best thing ever my goal is for my nightshifts to feel faster weekend. I'm off tomorrow too since I did a quick turn last week and they prob felt bad On tuesday, wednesday, saturday with my student, and then sunday. the weekend after that I have my student every day Excited that they are this confident in me. Nervous cause I'm shaping a new nurse. Eager to prove myself. There's one thing about me that I love, I'm one of those people who aren't scared of asking questions. I will question anything- you, my parents, a damn doctor who's team I'm working on, my boss... if I got a question, I will ask. Don't care if you think I'm dumb for doing it. So, I am happy to share that with my student. Those questions save lives. totally my questions are for clarification mostly. ran the concept, read the order, used my policy manuals and now clarified. you can't be handheld in the health field. you won't survive omg mood this attending one chewed out an interim in front of me he asked him about some medication effect on the body and he went for the book info and the attending looked at him dead in the eyes and said "quit the bullshit, don't regurgitate the information. right now explain it to me, simple, or tell me you don't know and I'll explain" I would've found it sexy if it wasn't for the arrogant way he said it. arrogance is not sexy, confidence is. they won't *understand* it doctor 's can suck. I had a pt literally code, a nurse and myself were there helping him return to consciousness, and he was scared. doctor came in to check him out and he reached out to grab their arm, to *feel* in the midst of his fear, and she brushed off his arm and stepped away. a fucking cunt. I almost said something to her... he literally died. he is scared & alone. comfort him you cunt. just overall useless people everywhere working for paychecks mhm all the important stuff are pricey lol Try to buy some strawberries or potatoes. I prioritize fruits and veggies. More things I can cook with them vs eggs Sexy He looks like an actor Who am I thinking of- OH. HE LOOKS LIKE CHACE CRAWFORD WITHOUT THE HAIR ugh chace.

Never had a problem there tho. Guess we were still at that age where we didn‚Äôt racially assault Truly That‚Äôs a lot of places. I‚Äôve definitely gotten my jollies watching a white person not understand AAVE or just be uncomfortable at self expressions like pls, relax. see, in from the ghetto. Whites here say it and they don‚Äôt really get told they can‚Äôt cause they were raised in the hood. It doesn‚Äôt affect me so I don‚Äôt tell them what they can/can‚Äôt but it also goes the same for Hispanics totally baby, you know those fools want their cake and eat it too. they wanna be a part of it all but not acknowledge they‚Äôre the problem that happens a lot when It‚Äôs their neighborhood and shit ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not allowed to be here. They‚Äôre doing something wrong‚Äù yadda yadda Amen. if you ever want to share, here or privately, I‚Äôm all ears babe. Sorry for the experience(s).

I can‚Äôt imagine being in the same school for 6 years Puerto Rico does the 8th-12th grade for high school and I always found that wild those are babies with adults hence why they got knocked up Mmm; that sounds similar too. All the younger kids shared campus with college kids.

Something told me someone said something about me and I see this lmaoooo Hmmm :) I won‚Äôt ever punish anyone for telling the truth my goal was also for that image to live in people‚Äôs heads rent free I genuinely be forgetting my birthday is coming up and then you do the countdown it's a classic case of you had to be there Dec 22-Jan 19 is this looks & personalities I like your ‚Äúwould prob simp‚Äù was mostly redheads nice I just asked cause I figured it was a mix I kinda go by vibes and what people say for who I think they‚Äôd be attracted to and some people on that list I figured would be higher but again, this is just looks Second row from the bottom, 6th from the left.

Seems like a cute white boy, maybe sneaky evil but overly corny. On the young side so I know that‚Äôs a thing you don‚Äôt like. Agreed. I‚Äôd run my fingers through it he gives me winter soldier vibes lol I like it mhm a bit with my bestie, she's a huge fan. nothing recent there‚Äôs something about this that isn‚Äôt sitting well Thanks babe. Appreciate it  üíó I like how this can be interpreted both ways‚Ä¶ why Asian‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand them OR why Asian‚Äôs don‚Äôt receive them. also, yes. It‚Äôs bs that they wouldn‚Äôt receive it cause every phone number is in a database and the more you add them to certain websites and stuff, it gives those people access to find it and use it. Yes lol that doesn‚Äôt make a difference it‚Äôs still the book I would still do VIP and have every book hiatus than not be VIP. no one it‚Äôs top tier Is it? If you‚Äôre gonna go the language route, touch as many as you can. Probs won‚Äôt be at all. nah, I rather not get something than have it half-assed not hard to get a fluent person to commit to the job, just gotta pay them for their services as if I‚Äôd give them any of my free time and not be compensated you must be new here.

You and I lead the sexy campaign I‚Äôm going back to work. Fuck this :stitchgoodbye: Are people just this fucking dense? There's so many damn reasons they're putting books in hiatus.
- burnout. -covid
- medical situations.
- school/children
- trying to make things work so everyone wins honestly, players are pissing me off. wow entitled must you be to whine about books being on hiatus and not think about the fact that they don't like doing this for shits & giggles. the gift is so over the top too, they honestly are fearful of losing more players. I wouldn't expect a gift, and it's sad that they feel like it's a must. esp cause I know people are gonna get it and cashout. hope they keep tabs on who is a monthly subscriber & who just subbed after this post. social media algorithm is a thing, and that does happen... but it's literally here too. any server too. that's not algorithm, that's just people being entitled pricks touch some grass is one of my fave expressions btw. This isn‚Äôt a free pass to clown on VIP players who are upset.

Non-VIP players bitch and moan every other day as well, and they‚Äôre just as entitled & do less for PB. take several seats FYI this is a solid example. Y‚Äôall clowning on this but many wanna be mute when it‚Äôs about Hero, MW, and whatever other cancelled sequel in the grave. it‚Äôs both sides. one is not better than the other, but they both do the same thing and that‚Äôs my point. people feeling all cute and funny but don‚Äôt like it when the finger is pointed at them. it‚Äôs the deflection for me lol Self insertion. or see outside of themselves why it‚Äôs ok for them to exist/be the way they are. the not me, not in my life, none of my experience is very exhausting. get üëè the üëè fuck üëè over üëè it pop goes the weasel :CB_tea: don‚Äôt forget the BB orgy fae, everyone goes crazy for that but god forbid you bring a spank into the bedroom he did. He said they had a past ? I don‚Äôt get the joke? So the Caucasian can‚Äôt? But there‚Äôs so much black on black crime. Any race really you know people are racist to their own race? like they don‚Äôt accept that side of themselves? wdym what does that have to do? You said they made a comment about Ethan, but raf was right there. As if he automatically has to be an ally ???? you did so glad we can spin things :sh_xlebronturnt: wait, baby.

That price is discounted too. My hospital covers some wellness costs cause they‚Äôre nice like that what is brave https://tenor.com/view/hmm-ok-cafe-peki-peki-iyiymi%C5%9F-aynen-gif-24016963 today sure is something. Who is they? More like why be in a server if a simple question goes ignored. Among other things. my toes are numb.

It‚Äôs what you first notice Pop off can you share a pic? I wanna know what it looks like never heard of this That looks yummy! Baking is so relaxing, I love doing it so much but it takes a certain kind of headspace for me. Glad you got to have some time for it üíï With me, if I‚Äôm not calm or happy, it feels like I‚Äôm not doing it any justice :( Don‚Äôt be! Knowing others are out there happy and baking just motivates me State mandated law, California is one of them. Come to the east coast. You get me and paid leave 5/9 states for us I really want to visit those restaurants Metta had recommended so eventually just send me recs. I‚Äôll do em I get my calendars from the bank. Foolproof. You don‚Äôt know MutualOne They‚Äôre big fans. Bet Remind me to drive to a house later Stop. One birthday this year was enough. Don‚Äôt want to do it again Also- I was planning on photoshop snape onto my calendar and show it to you but I figured I got other things to do than that lol ü§ù In his defense, you didn‚Äôt caption the spoiler. it‚Äôs under the photo so if you scroll, you‚Äôd tap then read I get that but wordle has a literally spoil-proof way to share that‚Äôs how everyone does it I assume last Which like, isn‚Äôt the worst Bobby Bobby is my fave Robert Roberts That sounds hilarious! whose the streamer? is that someone they call x Ray? He looks familiar it‚Äôs that euphoria vibe what time And where Always ask them this before going ‚Ä¶. Recess? I‚Äôm used to the kid version of recess and was confused who tf had that in the morning the awkward gap between i-an is sending me LMAO Yes I love sights I heard this shit and immediately screamed the chorus üòÇüòÇüòÇ I love waking up and seeing my man‚Äôs on staff ‚ù§Ô∏è hiya papi my state got rid of it one year and then it was re-appealed and we got it back lol time is a social construct I just live if I wake up at 2am or 10pm, whatever. let my body just do it‚Äôs things damn nice job faeeee Happy Holi! @FraternalGemini did you end up going on your trip? The one you were having trouble with your friends with? I want an update. What about the situation in question sure! Hi! Welcome! if you turn it off enough, it‚Äôll stay off. that‚Äôs how mine is. sometimes I mean to ping someone and I forget to turn it on that‚Äôs weird? maybe cause I‚Äôm beta? good point I think I‚Äôve pinged Mara more often than not but I do it for important stuff So I fly right under the radar :pikacool: she‚Äôs never said so, I call lies? Lol djdshkshshdb wow every time you say that, it sounds singular and I just picture one big breast on my chest Petition to just should I send a leg photo idk what the obsession is with the states thing. Doesn‚Äôt really make much of difference to the plot? It‚Äôs just a setting in most books. There‚Äôs a handful which were a different location but they put the effort into it cause it would impact it. That‚Äôs what I mean, if it‚Äôs relevant to the plot- for sure try something new, make it up or whatever but most books are just putting a name to a place cause someone will be like ‚Äúwhere the heck is this?‚Äù But changes nothing Also Drew. SR is based in Chicago. They also go to Seattle. Just cause I saw you mention it. it‚Äôs raining here but I hear some clicking against my windshield that don‚Äôt sound like rain drops lol Sometimes I leave little comments for Mara to find but she takes forever to find them üòÇ I‚Äôve left some in the past that I think got lost in messages üòò flashback to my pedi office huh, I use that for APA formatting reference. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever noticed some section that allows that. There is an ESL area that is helpful. I learned that but because I‚Äôve taken computer science lol not a bad class either there‚Äôs a few setting changes you have to do which gets annoying so I just freehand do not get me started! I think I‚Äôve once successfully split page for some weird presentation. 0/7 after that I put in the numbers for the margins and ms word decides she knows better even then, I still prefer it over Google docs. There‚Äôs just something about it. I like slanted handwriting when others do it. Very neat anything in this world is bad if you use it the wrong way. most cars on the road is horrible for the environment but you don‚Äôt see me ditching mine to use better transport methods. something‚Äôs you can control and others you can‚Äôt. No but Susan from Dollar Tree is ** ** Nothing in religion should be considered law. It‚Äôs all up to a person‚Äôs interpretation so just do what you want, believe in what you want, and permit others the same. Either way, societal input will have something to say. I‚Äôm the best/worst at this cause I genuinely don‚Äôt give a fuck. I believe, I support, I think I practice in my daily (but I don‚Äôt visit as often). Does that make me superior? No. Just makes me feel good and in touch. And people who can have the same without any of that is cool too. Nearly all elective surgeries that benefit women/female anatomy are deemed unnecessary and aren‚Äôt covered. America loves to control our bodies. Reminder that some offices require the husband‚Äôs approval. yeah, any guy and go in and ‚úÇÔ∏è but if I wanted to üéÄ I need to have kids, be past my 20s, get my husband to approve AND deem it medically necessary :)))) YES! A lot of abortions back then were in-home and from loved ones because they couldn‚Äôt go anywhere else. So sad we put our bodies in harm because those who swore to help care for us and push for autonomy strips us from that very thing. I absolutely want kids, love them, cherish them. But also don‚Äôt want anyone else who is not interested to be manipulated by the government. Less kids in foster homes pls Also Adam, I‚Äôm glad she did that. Any time I discharge someone I sent them with supplies.

Inhalers, pumps, supplies to wrap their wounds, socks, anything I have in the room that we used‚Ä¶ take it!! I don‚Äôt need it. PSA: if you ever go to the hospital for anything and receive the medical bill that‚Äôs just SUPER out of your budget. Request an itemized bill. It breaks down the expenses per supplies and tests/procedures. Report and discrepancies. Sometimes supplies are marked up (expensive). You can use an online tool to compare the prices with other hospitals and get a better deal. They‚Äôll be annoying about it, or respect it if they get it, but either way who cares. It‚Äôs you that‚Äôs paying. Happy Ace Day to my lil babies üíï I‚Äôm always online. Even when I‚Äôm not do they have a variety of sizes? I‚Äôve noticed this store near me but haven‚Äôt tried anything not bad comfortable? I‚Äôll give them a shot. I‚Äôm in need of new jeans I‚Äôm liking what I hear. I‚Äôll show you what I get oh baby..... @FraternalGemini I'm ok babe, just trying to finish this discussion so I can play games on my switch lol you??? I need skincare tips. my coworker is getting her license and I can't wait for the free botox where did you get this data? not sure if that‚Äôs a good criteria I thought maybe it was files if I‚Äôm paying, you better give me all the details tf they broke, I‚Äôm broke, let‚Äôs get it that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ just an occurrence this belongs in UT Pitch it IS IT EASTER TIME ON ACNH I want my eggies I have so many from last year that I didn‚Äôt get to use but not enough to build everything THE BEST NEWS I‚ÄôVE HEARD ALL DAY and I got paid today üòÇ making it my personal mission to go before I hit 30 Anyone can make threads right? like I don‚Äôt need perm? Started a thread. No I‚Äôve seen thinner versions which are hotter This is for those with gauges there‚Äôs a lot of childish things that go on and this wouldn‚Äôt be the worst one I haven‚Äôt read anything besides the last line I like both of you so I have no sides I‚Äôm just here. take me at my in-between or hate me as your enemy that‚Äôs a big risk it‚Äôs the classism for me üòÇ that sounds so like her and unlike her at once The first one outfit is better but the second‚Äôs hair is literally perfect cuz weebs ‚ù§Ô∏è It‚Äôs a string! come on Pri the goose with human arms oh so that‚Äôs the ayumu part it‚Äôs kinda wild how much y‚Äôall care about his sub he ain‚Äôt doing it for y‚Äôall lmao can‚Äôt believe this is how you want our relationship to come out smh I‚Äôm crying I know I wasn‚Äôt the only who saw that No but I am I sliced a good chunk of my nail peeling potatoes. It grew back within 2 weeks perfectly fine. but my nails always grow fast I‚Äôve also had someone run over my foot with a car :) I will if you really want me to lmao it‚Äôs wild I‚Äôm baby. Ok story time!
My batshit mother was having a manic episode and severely hallucinating and we were having a huge verbal argument outside. She tried to take off in my car and obviously I tried to stop her but she wasn‚Äôt having it so I told her that I‚Äôm removing me belongings from the car and I was leaning in the backseat grabbing my backpack and I was in the process of stepping away when she floored it. And I mean FLOORED. Bitch channeled SpongeBob and just said slammed the gas and went right over my foot, tires squealing and all. It was actually hilarious. I was in pain because I had a huge bone bruise but nothing broken or fractured and when I went to the hospital to do some scans, they asked me what happened and my sister was sweating bullets cause she thought I would report her üòÇüòÇ my friends/coworkers: how was your weekend Lu?
me: my mama ran over my foot with my own car :))) my sister: she wasn‚Äôt paying attention‚Ä¶
me: yeah, messing around and wasn‚Äôt paying attention.
nurse: ok‚Ä¶. *flags my chart* LMAO truly She was absolutely done with me and the lie. in total Lu fashion, before I went to the hospital I limped over to a house party and drank lmao and then left the hospital to go to another skdhhsjj It worked here lol ngl steak shack is overhyped but still mid that‚Äôs stereotyping babe, let‚Äôs not push labels. Guess who also has green eyes üíï Where is Mara I just remembered we were talking about pretty eyes and I want us to compare I don‚Äôt have to ping her, she‚Äôs got a good Lu radar she‚Äôll eventually come to me like a good girl That's a cute idea. I'd be done for it. I hear disaster bi and I think of my boy Zig I shipped Zig with Aaron so hard!! They both balanced each other out so well. I romanced Zig and whenever we did group stuff together with Aaron I felt like the third wheel lmao. That club scene when Zig casually dances up to my MC to inform her that Teddy is just sOooOOOoo dreamy ü•≥ I would call them Zaaron. Who would be the King/Queen of the straights? You can argue that Zoe just knows what's conventionally attractive I think aside from Ian, she hasn't said a word about any of the frat bros. Except that one football star she was a fan of Oh god, they changed it again?? I just got used to the last one. why does a name need such emphasis.... I'm in the middle of MFTL and the random switch to NOAH took me a second lol. My initial reaction was "why are you yelling??" It was all caps but the font with the spacing makes it more... aggressive? I'm excited I saw screenshot of a message with PB on one of the choices fb groups. The automated message is ‚Äúwe are looking forward to sharing more books this December" My first guess is Foreign Affairs. but it was plural... so idk which other book they would be talking about I wish PB would be more mindful of how they go about racial injustices in books depending on which sprite you choose. I am sad to say that there are many scenes I've prob missed because of my sprite selection I might get flamed for this but I've heard such glowing comments and recs on BOLAS so I gave it a shot. I made it to ch 3 and I'm disinterested should I give up? I was thinking of stopping there and go play TE instead does anyone think I'll have the same problem or there's a chance it'll be a better read for me? I loved TC&TF so I figured this would be just as awesome what chapter do you feel is when everything picks up? Got it. I have 3 in my party right now so makes sense. Thank you I'll finish the book and hopefully I'll come back as a huge lover of it maybe I'm the missing key of book 2. They're waiting on me to catch up so they can spit out the sequel lol :Duffyevil: I've come to the conclusion that every LI with a name that starts with *Cass-* are just too good to be true. continue the trend PB Why not Declan? Technically he‚Äôs old news since he‚Äôs supposed to be behind bars but a man with money can bail out easily Can we make a channel just to roast the inaccuracies of the language? I can already picture it Do they have fluent, bilingual writers?? Do we expect them to be considerate enough to transfer over all the diamond purchases in the other book to this one? I'm really tempted going back to the OG book and making my own translation and then reading the book for the side by side reveal yeah there should be a space there they messed up Maximo is the spanish version of Maximus. to be more specific, its Maximilliano/Maximillio the funny part is that not all names have to be switched, it really could've just stayed as Maxwell and just say it with an accent. Only named derived from others are the ones we change. its actually my pet peeve people's names being switched when its assigned in a certain way to be pronounced. Honor it. Others just leak it on tumblr and let everyone and their momma see it for no reason but to bash PB and feed their egos for having ‚Äúinside scoop‚Äù We are classy here. You're not wrong, sadly. The mistakes are glaringly obvious and its disappointing. Not PB placing MTFL under the romantic comedy section of the books :kek: romantic drama & steamy I just thought it was funny placing the book there since its taken a joke by many. it was like on the nose humor for me they need a special section named "what could have been" and a second one named "what did we do" I updated my phone and I don‚Äôt have it either. Which is weird cause it‚Äôs the same account I get my challenges feature on Top 10:
AME, BB, D&D, TF, OH, & TRR Editor‚Äôs pick:
BOLAS & RoD do you want to earn it the easy way or the hard way lol well actually, do you have VIP? If you don‚Äôt, that will literally be the hard way Have fun! I personally think it‚Äôs more tolerable when you binge it tbh I‚Äôve had it for 2 months. I told myself I wanted to test it and now I‚Äôm obsessed Perfect Match: Build-A-Partner Grandma, NO :kek: ARE WE DOING PUNS AGAIN I give that an A RCD3: Thomas Hunt disappoints I will not get over the speedo HSS: Scott Lee is the best I won't take criticism MM: Hot Dad, the sequel PTR I feel like goes from very bad to ok and it depends on how much diamonds you spend And that‚Äôs the vibe I got from Reddit as well Idk how Reddit noms work but does the sub vote for the winner? I‚Äôll vote Sorry to hear that. Take your time and care for yourself. We‚Äôre here if you need to talk üíï They 18+ tagged it I came back and y‚Äôall trashing the east coast and Metta deleted something I am sad I missed it all Intriguing. Of who and what Y‚Äôall acting like I said there was something wrong with it the trashing of the east coast lmao Go off kings & queens Voltra I dare you ME I wish I was the most eligible. I‚Äôd dominate the competitions I found it in the morning and let me tell you I was cracking tf up Hi, I finally got to meet my little Heir üíï Thank you! So we have RT finale, FA ch3, WB ch4, and MTFL ch93 not the best lineup, but I love content I just love two sisters rising no matter what that is a common complaint I do wonder how much less hated this book would've been if it was MC doing all the "fancy talk" and "preaching" as the fb moms ~~said~~ complained ngl I feel like PB would cancel it just to be petty tired of our crap Logan ü•∞ MC gets a degree in criminal justice to help her delinquent boyfriend and her new badass friend So we expect the entire group to come back or they pull a THM and get a new fast and furious gang the best movie before it all went to shit good taste No, I totally get that, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about. The asks you see in this community are usually logical and  for betterment of players... but for other communities in other sites, it‚Äôs just demanding PB to do what they want and soon enough they‚Äôll have enough of everyone‚Äôs crap Moved here cause no spoiler Anways, yeah, I see that, but you also have to keep in mind that the pack is all talk but the worse that has been done to us by them to us: using the bond to subconsciously get us to visit and just screaming no in our face whenever the mention of leaving is brought up. He is controlling in the way he speaks, which is so wrong, but its also just the way the story is playing out damsel in distress sucks for this reason Morgan... she really amped up her stuff with deceiving us (pending, since we only heard sides of the story, not the reality) and near forced us to help her in these scheme of ridding the world of wolves Yeah, they really said controlling LIs and that's it I don't like how it is playing out but it is supposed to set the MC into being in control at the end. She decides if she agrees with the pack, the hunters, or says "screw Hunt Peak, I'm out" OKAY. How weird is it that this game begins with MC just talking about magic already. Am I missing something or are they just really into la-la land and doesn't care that they're speaking to a professor lol ooooh, this is a pretty place. gives me Alice in Wonderland vibes TE MC just really decided to join this school, no questions asked. okay, the graphic of the multi-dimensional door was really cool Okay but this game is a banger Lmao Is there a date for that post? I said the same. Not about BOLAS, but about any book periods. Mhm. I just want it to be set up in this format.
TE3: untouched but coming, ETA blah blah blah.
TNA2: in the works, ETA ??? I want the ones we won‚Äôt get with a big fat C A N C E L L E D so there‚Äôs no mistake I feel like one of the expected sequels won‚Äôt be mentioned and they‚Äôll just try to surprise people I mean they could easily just tell us the wrong date. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be putting it all on the table as they claim. It‚Äôs PB, come on now. lmao I got the meaning of it hahahah. I like it. It‚Äôs a cute saying. Trust me I know how it feels having my sayings in Spanish and not knowing how to translate more like a treat, I think. Like ‚Äúoh wow,  you were right. Smart egg, here‚Äôs a cookie‚Äù Eleanor is displeased She‚Äôs the only ghost queen Oop, sorry Eleanor. Pri is a better person than me I think it was the third book I played when I just got the app and since I was familiar with Episode and their diamond stealing schemes, I was very picky with what I spent on To this day, I don‚Äôt even know what the end with her looks like I got modded on my MacBook. Sometimes I consider getting rid of my iPhone so I can just have my android in the palm of my hands Thanks Bel! That‚Äôs a cute ending. I like it, very choose your ending type but still HEA Happily Ever After Pri must be a Disney stan lmao Not to rain on this lesbian parade but Pri got some studying to do so she can pass her exam. Bye bye Pri. We will be here when you‚Äôre done. Just the particles, but that‚Äôs from junior hs memory Oh that‚Äôs that Coulomb and Faraday‚Äô law stuff right? Oof. Yeah I‚Äôm too rust to help Literally ping me when you‚Äôre ready üòÇ Oop. I should be but I‚Äôm a rebel How was your exam? :/ sorry about that What does that mean GPA? I got what you mean. I hope it doesn‚Äôt count for your sake :marafrogemoji: Just say you love toxic relationships and go They simp for Poppy but think Sofia is the devil. :OOF: BRACE LOL I think OH2 chapter 10-13 outdo TRH series lmao You‚Äôre not wrong babe but it‚Äôs Redditors voting. *waits* Firework got the brains You study the hell out of that biochem Her face looks diff. More fine tuned? Her hair also seems more voluminous Emi, please enlighten the smaller people including me btw :dogekek: where did you leave off? Wait, I‚Äôm confused. You did finish the series? I thought you said you did not read because you were disinterested in it Ah, got it. I recommend a read. By BB2, you‚Äôll know if you like it or not What was the reason? Slight change of topic but damn Kamilah. The fleek of the brows On point bby do I have to give you VIP? I‚Äôll consider it an investment No more katana while shirtless? Sad. modded? Updated? your device is also updated? we love that I‚Äôll happily take the blame You mean truth or truth? Obvi me :kek: There is no Scarlet. Pri, I‚Äôm waiting babe What did you say? Valid Voltra: I mean
Tatsu: levels up Voltra She meant what she said What do errors mean? are we steaming again üëÄ TE circle of friends and a pillow https://twitter.com/PlayChoices/status/1349863813630337029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw I think we win this fight lmao that was a ride might be a hint I picture Lily forgetting there is a fight going on around her as she familiarizes herself with your game collection Bang bang I‚Äôm pretty sure Geralt is from The Witcher. Random name drop lol This I what I wake up to on fb Dixon mentions ILITW book while cuddling with MC? A man after my own heart Am I weird for finding that adorable? ...... RUN. *badddddumm dunnn dunnn dunn* please tell me someone knows the vine lol THERE WE GO! those cracked me up all the time woo! RoE is the shortest book to score the 15 diamond for book completion. FYI 5 chapters baby. Quick and easy although they're kinda long I am 30 diamonds short of 3k but still got so many books to play I think I am gonna start with TRM they do not 5 chapters is the min babe for completion... that is RoE:N haha trust me, when I first got it I put it to the test Fat mood, Emi. I was so disappointed when I replayed Game of Love and did all that just for a chapter bono I feel like if they're that smart, they should also realize the difference between hundreds of users playing the book and purchasing premium scenes within first month of its chapter release vs 6 months from it to me, that shows which scenes were more popular if people played it immediately vs people playing it cause its there But your point with the logs was the financial support of players in such books... that means they think it be helping them, but its not. So, how smart are they really was my point. they can be reckless, but to this extent? they clearly don't want long career being aware and knowledgeable should not be confused if this is true, I'd give them credit because this isn't a VIP thing only. all mods were never able to tap into the key generator because its server sided. that is thinking 3 steps ahead yeah that person can fuck right off Nah, they're aware of scripts being leaked. Happens on fb, insta, and Tumblr Okay, so I pay VIP and use mod. They look at my account and say: she has played these books, bought these scenes, but has actually spent these diamonds. They look at my data on my device vs server for conflict in save progress and use that information.... to what. we want better books üò≠ It's both for me. Put your money where your mouth is but also let your voice be heard so others are informed and they can participate. Pri, I think they're saying that if you consciously spend, you can make a change. Let's say I have 300 diamonds. I can spend it all in BOLAS to show how much I love it and want a sequel or can choose to scatter the diamonds in different books that all dirty 30s. What would the data show? In scenario A, it shows that I LOVED Bolas and spent all my diamonds on it. Scenario B shows that I love steamy scenes (so more romance side of stuff) and that will continue to spend on it. Now, multiply this by 500 players who did the same and that's their analysis of what players did and use that for future books. In all honestly, it sounds great, makes sense, but people will play how they play. I think us taking accountability of the inequality of stuff is not right. We as consumers should dictate stuff but they as providers should be more aware and provide it. lol its okay, at least now Drew won't forget it even if he tried sad reality what happened to your keurig since you're suddenly my neighbor at 1234 Harvard Ave, I will be right over yeah we went crazy in no spoiler lol his angry face is confused and frustrated Sienna hard for me to dislike him since I date Justin's lmao its the assertive, low tempered cockiness I tell you gets me every time :CharmanderHi: ~~when your gayness is a plus lmao~~ sidelined blondes.... would you count Avery? he gets the spotlight for sure, but like, I think the scenes did not compare jferghsrgjisur LMFAO NO yeah, I found one but its not the first link for some reason. made it confusing thank you!! I literally squealed cause Daddy Drew called me Junebug also thanks everyone! I'm actually really impressed none of us repeated a birthday month shhhhh they don't know about that lol :zoeywink: :wut: I am APPALLED can you believe this mess? :bartiemad: lmao how dare you be funny in my time of suffering but seriously, I feel bad for everyone who joined during "adventure, horror, romance" we will know we hit rock bottom when they do a BDSM book lmao I hate how accurate that is as we are talking about this I am playing the one where you're a brat LOL Playing Hard to Master lol it isn't the worst but its kinda boring ngl He's like Cassian- attractive and sweet For the genre options:
Romance: TRR
Steamy: TNA gross BEL, I knew it it's why I changed it you mean three females sitting on a throne isn't sexy enough for you? Open Heart is 100% romance right? or is more drama? I wonder when it comes back if it'll take TRR place so the third one would be drama for OH? ugh place your bets, I think we will get the first chapter where we wake up with LI in bed, do couply stuff and still don't get an ily or committed convo until chapter 8 kinda like Dixon and MC LMAO I hate it I love the characters, but I hate it wait wdym about the OH/WEH thing cause Ethan appears in WEH oh, I thought of it like WEH is a true story and it was adapted did Keiki name the school she was accepted into? could've dropped a Hartfeld there 16 I thought old enough to consider college but not go unless she's a braniac dual-enrollment anyways, maybe OH3 will give us an easter egg lmao you beat me to it I was like faaaam, what jsdfdshj they re-tweeted it they're losing their minds I am still dumbfounded at how they've done nothing right :kek: us earlier: PB lacks attention to detail
PB: bet üëÄ Problem with that is more writers doesn‚Äôt mean good books. I hope whoever joined the team isn‚Äôt scared to vouch for everything that‚Äôs not romance I would think decrease their team cause of expenses. Buuuut, we shall see how that works out. 6mo contracts aren‚Äôt as lucrative as one would think. You earn more money with more experience and the longer you stay. That contract is basically paying you what you do for that short period in the cheapest way possible Is it just me or did they up their business lingo? I feel like they weren‚Äôt as strictly worded. Alas yes, they can‚Äôt just flat out say they wouldn‚Äôt hire anyone full-time for more years. No one would apply lol. We will see which new writers stay a longer time. Sorry Pri, I just did some checking and one of the writers who left did ES Jen, apparently. Taage was a writer as well and he left long ago seems like another one bites the dust it‚Äôs the way they gave me the great book that is MM and then got pushed out the door a n n o y e d I am playing it as we speak. EW ETHAN WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIS FACE the hospital looks futuristic https://tenor.com/view/who-are-you-people-spongebob-patrick-gif-7335905 new Ethan got plastic surgery cause he got tired of being called old to MC's back for carrying the entire hospital you see that hidden person on the right door, barely noticeable? its Aurora. how? three fingers down, index pointing, thumb to the back? Omg wait the finger I thought extended was the thumb Yeah, no they fucked that up watch them allow us to get a dirty 30 as a farewell PB is that type of weird https://tenor.com/view/simon-cowell-thats-a-no-its-a-no-its-a-no-from-me-gif-7663264 Pri, I literally was just talking about this earlier She removed the gibberish but doesn‚Äôt sort out the choices with corresponding dialogue or events She basically takes the decode, removes the frills, and gives it to people like... you do that and then you watermark it as if it‚Äôs your stuff? plz there‚Äôs so many ways to do it and that‚Äôs an interesting idea I would try it for fun but not sure how effective it would be she‚Äôs just way too entitled about her stolen content lol I wouldn‚Äôt put it past PB but I also think it‚Äôs fans reaching. Anything to protect Ethan and the valuable relationship Lmao we got the picture. You can stop sharing the posts! Thanks This book will be so fun https://tenor.com/view/marge-simpson-the-simpsons-shy-shame-ashame-gif-16916873 https://tenor.com/view/jos2-whosthat-gif-5705497 lmao I didn't mean it literally, just meant that it looks nothing like her imo Apparently there‚Äôs a new writer who joined the OH3 staff. Not sure if hired from another company. But with the lay-offs that‚Äôs been happening, time will give us more info on what they‚Äôre planning Don‚Äôt recognize the name from newsletters Her pinned tweet is kinda... out there Lmao. Oh this isn‚Äôt the pinned tweet lol. I shared that in cursed chat I do like her excitement as well. Always good to have passionate people Kyobeans LMAO wut no idea I think continually speaking them, account, and anything else related to that nature is exhausting at this point. they're gonna be them and we will do us. Sonia... its what she deserves I feel bad that I didn‚Äôt acknowledge it I just didn‚Äôt know the answer lol KAHOOT Is it for us!??? It‚Äôs Metta glossing over what Bel said AGAIN Lmfaoooo I love kahoot as well and I can‚Äôt wait to play It‚Äôs fine, I was just poking fun and I‚Äôll tell you all about it BEL LMAO It‚Äôs Bel uno reversing us when Metta been the one ignoring you the audacity It‚Äôs the dang for me lmao Yeehaw I‚Äôll stop roasting you. It‚Äôs been a rough month for you You are the Bryce expert METTA WHY DID YOU EMOTE ME r u d e Anyways Rip Metta You still haven‚Äôt gotten your stimmy??? Check your bank. Mine was added and I didn‚Äôt even expect it cause I get checks in the mail Weird I ignored that option. It scared me See, I don‚Äôt have direct deposit and this one was direct deposit so I was so confused I read the memo and then I was like... oh? Nope: never do This is amazing. Thank you! Bel Report back to me plz I don‚Äôt have the link and I‚Äôm on my phone ..... the SB MC I figured you were going to check to find the answer to your wonder Bel, this is not the time for selfies You goober WHAT ,!??!??! where‚Äôs the race part lol Point taken. I‚Äôd like to keep my racist jokes at the score I am at rn. Which is 0. When you say hands... do you mean the position of the arms like hand on hips or actual... differences to their fingers? uh huh Why he got a mustache?? Who is that lmao I‚Äôm talking about the messed up photo Is that what y‚Äôall are talking about? Oh, you were quick to say Liam and Cassian... I was like how. It‚Äôs a neck. It‚Äôs Ethan for all I care Ugh, Bel. Can I hire you to host a class? Sprites 101. I need it. I am totally okay with that I hate it. Honestly, PB sucks at decision making but that's a little too extreme I think their efforts are going more to VIP books and that's a shame seems to me like they just don't manage well the resources and time evenly and yeah, since VIP is money, it is at an advantage what happened with aster? from the jump or later on? üëé what I'd do to sit her down and just rip her apart she needs to humble down what you want me to do? hop in her dm's? she'd ignore it lmao "if you don't ass kiss than get your butt outta here" That‚Äôs literally how I picture laws going Why did I think this was slow burn? I really got my hopes up for a sabotage lmao fight me my tatas are always calm, can't say the same for yours üíã Hiii Pri, hope you're having a swell day and enjoying your break uh huh, sureeeee he madddd :nyangiggle: oh that's hot he madddd :kr_zz_DaisyGiggle: isn't that because of the customizing? thanks Pri, always know how to say what I mean I'm petty :owoSmug: luckily I'm both duality Bel, the greatest thing you've ever said YASSSSSSS it triggered you so it had to be said again I want a long hair male LI manbun for the win its drew still thinking he's funny for me TOM OG bun do the stanky leggggg kajndkhbfkdslm anyways manbuns yes OMG I FORGOT GAVIN MY BOY WRONG ONE COME ON UBER BOT THERE HE IS good bot Bel if you can switch one LI to manbun, who would it be its bel not answering me oh, do continue I pick... Prince Diavolos. something about the eyebrow slit and manbun that calls to me oh shit right I was gonna say Simon since he has the long-ish hair but I like it how it is although he'd look great with a manbun too I still want to learn this :(( I have no idea how to use this knowledge Lu go brrrr BET I WON'T LMAO There‚Äôs so many variables so the safest answer is before the chapter‚Äôs release. I think most have it at least a day or two before. It feels a bit unfair to say that they‚Äôre being ‚Äúforward‚Äù because they‚Äôre going through personal problems? Maybe they‚Äôre just that frustrated with the situation, which it seems like, since they spoke on their frustration that their original comment on feeling excluded went ignored. I support the language thing. I don‚Äôt support not using credible people to fully translate. You can‚Äôt just choose a word, there‚Äôs so many dialect, meanings in different contexts. My one grievance. Physics gang. I'm a crime scene, murder doc nerd and learning the logistics/analytics of it was awesome my physics teacher was also a horror buff so we just went around watching scenes and proving/disproving the accuracy of them he was one of the better parts of my senior year he also loved Star Wars and dressed up every year as Darth Vader, he would greet us at the door and say "may the 4th be with you" I love goofy people like that yes! I know some people would tease him but I respected him so much for being so care free and making class fun despite people questioning the methods we all know high schoolers are brutal PB makes this a book, I dare you. Probs cause OH was the golden book A lot of their socials was about it, raving about how great it is or people looking forward to next chapters and thought if someone wanted to check out the app.. they‚Äôd see this. The future looks bright based on these ads lol‚Ä¶ Bryce knocks up his bro‚Äôs gf and Ethan is the ruler of some foreign country And next week on Jerry Springer‚Ä¶ real life Superman gets sued for reckless endangerment I never made it past second mid-book I only checked of Euphoria since it‚Äôs the only one I watched and enjoyed I‚Äôve gotten three of those ever since I downloaded the app lol It‚Äôs been a thing for a while Really? That‚Äôs weird. The last time I remember getting that was with the new age rating at the store I‚Äôm glad I found this. Lol You damn right. Guess PB and I gotta battle now more wholesome and appealing ngl bolas is the book I‚Äôm least excited about in the lineup So you know it‚Äôs stacked Surrender hyped to the max I WILL FIGHT Metta square up Be crime, do gay Drew: I do crimes, did hard time, got a hot man with a awesome behind. that‚Äôs your new anthem hoe Drew will literally explode combusting as we speak zinger üòÇ that‚Äôs for sure the way I remember him I romanced him too. I‚Äôd still let you feed off me Adrian got feddddd R I P THAT          AYEEEE OMG YES. It looks like a younger, paler Sinclair I romanced him, I‚Äôm allowed to roast what his kid would look like idk, I got kinda excited when he wanted to fight the old weird guy. Til he got shot like a dumbass I hit my all time high and low at that part lmao Poppy supremacy. Mean girls FTW Enemies to lovers but make it ‚ú® gay ‚ú® Bet. Although I do like her as just a FWB but I know others want her as an LI, so give them the option. omg bet x2 Carter smexy.

You can argue people‚Äôs behavior towards this shows division was there long before üëÄ what do we want it for convince me and I‚Äôll do it lmao probs cause I think iPhone won‚Äôt have ittttt unless you are iPhone‚Ä¶ why not? I got money this is how we learn It‚Äôs not irresponsible if it works and if it doesn‚Äôt, than we learned It‚Äôs called investing PRI Because *I‚Äôm* cool It makes perfect sense I need to know what the correct way looks like so I can have an idea of how off this is I think I do from when I downloaded xcode Let me run a command to see I guess not, hmmm. let me get it My AaronxZig dreams are ruined.

Separating newborns and school aged kids isn‚Äôt the same. School aged ones are used to forming their own friends and interest. They got their own personalities so the distance is cool newborn babies literally know nothing but the comfort they felt when they were sleeping together in the womb Right? Metta did me right. LMAO fae up to some trouble rn :ruserious: :SONIAWINK: Azura Make fun of someone you don‚Äôt like ü§£ wow, I‚Äôm a mental health enthusiast they look gross and empty my niece/nephew love them and it seems like it offers very little taste when did the app challenge change from 2 chapters to 3? I just noticed it and I'm big sad I had the 2 for 2 deal. shame that extra chapter hurts do you play mobile? the ads now are interactive if you don't do the "press here" or "swipe here" it won't count. so, do the game command, it'll take you to the app store, hit close (x) or back to app, and then it should go through. people on Reddit are coming out with their hot takes and can I say IT‚ÄôS ABOUT TIME. Take out the mf‚Äôin trash boo the OG post may, but the comments itself is a diff narrative ^^ and it should be to no one‚Äôs surprised how more kind and reasonable they are. comparisons are dumb, generalizations are stupid‚Ä¶ play the book and give a thoughtful critique or don‚Äôt touch it or speak on it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm buying them a round of shots. they went from small business to a bigger funded company- so roles and expectations change when it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs money and quota are trying to meet. I didn‚Äôt say smut exclusive. Any book that has good feedback will be getting better treatment and fast track to sequels. And they have said time and time again, the ones people think are the best are not keeping the lights on. It is to them and they‚Äôre still around and doing better than they have for a while back. There was a time where they were rough and they corrected. And they said they‚Äôre working on it, which I don‚Äôt believe, but that‚Äôs on them. It‚Äôs not tossed in the gutter yet so they‚Äôre still working to keep others happy hold on, I‚Äôm busy so I can‚Äôt express myself accurately TBC Ok reviving:‚Ä®‚Ä®
- ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk if you don‚Äôt read‚Äù is valid. I don‚Äôt see it as a way to stop conversations, but we can all agree people like to just be super negative and share that negativity as in facts.‚Ä®‚Ä®

What I think people mean by this is to give the book a shot, wasn‚Äôt for you? Cool. Share why without being disrespectful. Going to just diamond mind? Cool, share if there‚Äôs anything that made it a little interesting. Constant hate is just exhausting for everyone.‚Ä®‚Ä®

- ‚Äúcancelled books are cancelled, so move on‚Äù can be expressed better. For me, I think it‚Äôs the comparison‚Äôs that are annoying. I know others agree. We get it, you liked those books and wanted to have a series out of them- I enjoyed some of them myself but I won‚Äôt just go around and say ‚Äúwe got TNA9 but only 1 DS‚Äù cause it‚Äôs not fair to those who liked both or either. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

We can be upset because of the lost potentials but also support PB for making hard decisions. Writers don‚Äôt want their books to be a standalone, but they gotta do what is best for them, and we can be sad it came to that and continue giving feedback through their surveys and on the monthly newsletter when they ask what genre we want to see next, tell them! Vote! you prob will get it, even if you have to wait a while. - ‚Äúsex sells, etc‚Äù is not a shield but fact. Society decided sexy is all the way in. Books on these topics will be on shelves, magazines with covers on how to spice it up will be sold, blah blah blah.‚Ä®‚Ä®

I have three thoughts on this:
‚Ä®1) Sexy books is not for everyone. You know what you‚Äôre tolerant of, you know what you like, so if you know that Surrender/TNA/Witness is not going to be something you enjoy, that‚Äôs so fine. Ridiculing the book because of the mature themes is not. I don‚Äôt see someone discussing BOLAS saying ‚Äúwow this is for nerds, can‚Äôt believe you fantasy lovers think this is amazing‚Äù but there‚Äôs people who will speak on the more hyper-sexual books on how disgusting they are, how horny people are ruining the app- or the dreaded ‚Äúfb moms.‚Äù It‚Äôs a bad look. So this goes back to my first point, don‚Äôt go out of you way to be extra negative. Stay away from the book if it‚Äôs not for you or if you want to give it a shot, go ahead. If you learn then why it‚Äôs not good, just say why. There‚Äôs always a better way to express yourself that doesn‚Äôt have to put down others.‚Ä®‚Ä®

2) The sexy books being of lesser quality talk is just frustrating. If someone wanted to read about meeting someone and boning them in the next scene that follows, they can go to other apps which provide it quick and easy. PB does a pretty good job at fleshing out emotions, building up relationships and then the scenes itself (we all can name some disastrous moments so we can all agree they can do soooooo much better). Just cause it has sex in more chapters doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs lesser quality because it‚Äôs just not easy writing a good sex scene. 3) I‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôll just share it again‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt get how some people like sex scenes in SW, TRR series, BOLAS, PM or QB but then think PB is going down the drain with recent books that just have more sex scenes. The books still have a plot, whether you think it‚Äôs a good one or not is up to debate, but sex has been around since day one. Some books didn‚Äôt have it, which is great, but we literally got to hookup in most of the OG books so why is there a problem with more sex scenes now? Just say it‚Äôs the book you don‚Äôt like and leave the sex out of it. Say that you want to see more of *blank* and leave out the part of I want less of *blank*. Papi, ya tu sabes. what do the skies say rn? @FraternalGemini Since you re-stated some of your original comments, seems like you didn‚Äôt read much into the points I touched upon. If anyone else has any points, I‚Äôd like to hear them as well. @DaHomieDrew I watched a livestream snippet of Corpse talking about how cool gaming and all the jazz is but he kinda misses the creepy pasta narration videos. So here is my idea, we submit him to narrate choices books. Which LI‚Äôs/MC do we picture with deep voices for him to go all static on LI-
1) Mal. I just feel like he‚Äôs got the rough voice.
Damien. This is kind of a cop out cause they said it in game but whatever, he can speak low and Spanish to me LMAO Listen, Sam is my bitch but I gotta say, he got a high pitch voice I‚Äôm talking Chris Evan‚Äôs high the two I said aren‚Äôt ever that low but deeper in the list of people OH BASTIEN Since he growls and shit stop that was just a funny typo üíÄ vocal fry is so hot Thank you for making him hotter Ethan totally vocal fry‚Äôs because that‚Äôs just how he shows disinterest. What a guy üòÇ don‚Äôt be shy same my ideas went poof I searched up vocal fry on YT and fell into a rabbit hole of who out-whistles who lol Omg I just searched him up and I‚Äôm crying I can picture him telling MC to bend over in that voice skdhdhsjsh end FRAT IS2G DYING I heard the lowest note! Bless my ears wait sksjsjsjshs not me being in a trance after the low note and the next bitch vocal frying START A RIOT that was a punch the one girl who sang like a fricking flute and violin, honey. Bless you. The crescendo was a masterpiece If Kelly Clarkson is not here, I don‚Äôt want it. for the purpose of gearing this back‚Ä¶ I ruined the vibe. Sue me. It was either me or someone else ü•∫ gimme your grudge men Yeah. I found him with no sleep and ugh. Just such a good voice I know it‚Äôs from illness and he suffers but way to use a bad thing and make something good from it He also found such a cute, loving group of streaming friends because of what he did. So wholesome. 10/10 want to hug This week‚Äôs newsletter is gonna be like:
1. Hey, you‚Äôre still pissed but we got you. BOLAS will be out by end of 2022-early 2023.

Vague outline of the new lineup- COP, secret book, and then wide release of VIP books Don‚Äôt make Aku live her step bro life :( Hi, that‚Äôs me :) :( get your agile booty over here you sussy wussy :SONIAWINK: I like when you post this cause it‚Äôs like your pfp is reacting Carter: üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è

They‚Äôre a minute late from last month I‚Äôm gonna fight PB I need the newsletter to drop for distraction reasons It is afternoon They meant evening Silly goose https://tenor.com/view/benedict-cumberbatch-go-away-bye-leave-gif-5875554 They‚Äôre writing it as we speak I WAS RIGHT LMAO I FUCKING CALLED IT MOVE OVER AKU. I AM THE REAL INSIDE SCOOPER Untamable is Surrender pt 2 Cursed Hearts is Surrender pt 3 arrgggggg its here no lol SW but not really BOLAS2 October 2023 what is DA ? Metta and I would love this MC is secretly a twin and her twin had a daughter that looks JUST like the heir and they switch You can thank me later, PB isn‚Äôt Liam adopted? oh I knew they weren‚Äôt full blood üòÖ well, maybe there‚Äôs one more brother who didn‚Äôt make it That‚Äôs the dad What the heck does WIP stand for thank you I know it wasn‚Äôt this but in my head I said Written in Persian How talented of you nice to meet you Joey Graceffa when someone interrupts me mid-glam Reddit üëè  mods üëè  pop üëè  off üëè they're over the blatant disrespect of some users to others and made a call out post reminding everyone of the rules. they highlighted WB, QB2 and Surrender. :mhm: just cause it happens doesn't make it ok. pretty sure there's been an influx, given they named some newer books, and they're calling for it to stop. won't stop people but it shows they aren't gonna tolerate it so easily wonder where I heard that before lmfao idc either. give them books to play as male only, it's fair. but dismissing a book cause it's female MC only is my trouble area they can def try it. wouldn't hurt. just more data to prove who is their breadwinner I would prefer Female/Male MC than GOC tbh. of the ones I played, they're not the best. not even done well either I just find the writing super subpar *cough* FA it shouldn't be safe and mild, you can make them as if they're two diff LI's but same story and then add the variable anyway, PB will make mistakes. It's human... but I still want them to be risky, exactly you can call the newer sexy books as a risk. not the worst of them but after all the backlash as they transitioned to sexier making complete sex books is a big one Hail Mary is TNA for sure. I would call VIP an interception. to me, this is a cry for money. VIP made good books. people were happy, but fast-tracking all books to be VIP now is bad in my eyes. it only did well because they gave it special attention, if all books are now labeled this, you're gonna have the hit and miss we have now yup I see that warning and just :blink: bel lmao here indescribable asian lookin nice üëÄ I don't ever see the guys options unless shared cause I obvs go for girls LMAO honey :CB_run_laugh: of all people I eat fish, thank you very much Mara soft on me ‚ú® again‚ú® what did I do to deserve this ‚ù§Ô∏è Listen Raleigh Mara, we need to play a game where we say who we romanced cause I am starting to believe we got the same type Mara and I gotta do a tier list. but would she go for Everett üëÄ slkadmwfsjnt NO its everett or julian .julian slow burn LMAO Mara, if you say *him*, I will scream. place your bet- do I mean E or J ...... mhm he's nice, literally all he got going for him Rae got taste anyways, I'm not screaming. I would've if she chose Julian E-vet gn .img jack ms match .img jaq ms match bro not the one photo .img jaque monroe there we go latina all the way but black is fine asf too the sprite I've disliked most so far is Marco from HC he's just not pretty yes he's big everywhere but his head its jsurt dlFKsgjrdh .img marco hot couture he looks like he sharted team boss forgot her name yes everything is too tight he scares me I ran into travis arms but he was ugly too he's my fave ginger so far tho the other one was not it oh wait, I was thinking of simon but he's blonde. I forgot. my fault lmfao which one was it Metta batting bitches left & right gimme the plot Sunkissed? PtR? WT? LH? LMAO really? .img rising tides .img rising tide LI for sure thought you would pick latina writer frat omfg outta nowhere bet' cause she stole the show but also didn't mind her business mood Metta.... jk but you know somehow I feel like this was the Madeline & Liam relationship thing Regina not being step... Cordonian people: eat the apple OR PERISH I would pay big bucks for Olivia to murder MC no hesitation. üëÄ fariz I want a link A man wanting a book to be male led isn‚Äôt a bad thing and I will die on this hill. a book once a year with rep is good for everyone and hurts no one. also explain the Ina‚Äôs wife part. I don‚Äôt think it has to be lustful either? Just let them have a book male led. It‚Äôs nice that girls get them, and yeah we dominate the population of players, but they can just make an effort. Again, a book here and there to test the field and get results is normal and makes people enjoy if it suits them. no one said obligation? We want LGBTQ+ rep? We want powerful women rep. Why not give a man a damn book that they‚Äôre the MC? surrender is nice in that. I like two sides of the story. Most wanted was too ok so let it happen? Trial and error is life. You can‚Äôt be successful if you don‚Äôt play the field it‚Äôs all data. Why do you talk about the men who play as all macho? Why is that the stereotype? what if they want a wholesome-geeky sci-fi book but they‚Äôre a man. Let them dream of that also, if you don‚Äôt like it when someone says go play books you like and don‚Äôt play the ones you don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ you shouldn‚Äôt endorse the same but with video games? no you specifically but people how is that not fair? Same thing is being said but in flipped situations. That can bother you, obviously I see them too in there. Along with all the smut shames that do the same under every post. It is bothersome, and there‚Äôs better ways to request stuff. She‚Äôs me dropping food down my shirt. Watching VH1 ain‚Äôt a secret babe lmao only the hips know bout it my dad loves little woman Atlanta lmao Ayeeee ‚ù§Ô∏è ü§§ Ethannnnn we love Santa Do you want chocolate chip cookie or gingerbread https://tenor.com/view/cookies-food-dessert-chocolate-chip-cookies-national-chocolate-chip-cookie-day-gif-19073253 That ad was hilarious. I‚Äôm here for all the drama That‚Äôs the most accurate ad I‚Äôve seen so far you won‚Äôt read it again get some sleep homie. you struggling ‚ú® no ‚ú® :pepehatgent: she thought she did sumn FORGET ABOUT YOUR PAST HOMIE NO] not this bitch being messy I thought she was part of the community but she's also very ignorant which confused tf out of me I get not accepting, but the stuff she says is straight no brain juice again, she speaks of a place more of ignorance than hate in my eyes which is super confusing. cause like, how has no one educated her? #2 for me. I‚Äôm the most loved ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• that‚Äôs your narrative üòú LMAO they were so late last time Still got an hour and 10 mins QB meets Hunger Games NVM I like this instead Every time they post late, it‚Äôs no-news They like to break hearts early in the day üòÇ New year, same BS ITS A WIN FOR THE HOES I‚Äôm kidding, but like, bring on the sexy me after a long session Zzzzzzz I want a hallmark cliche set in Vermont Alaska Surrender 2 :CB_tea: My app is up to date and still looks like that I don‚Äôt have the new UI‚Äôs my modded doesn‚Äôt either lmao Logan omg wordle is so fun! it‚Äôs a web game, there is a daily word and you basically try to find the answer. All the words are 5-letters long. Grey means wrong, yellow means correct but in the wrong spot, green means correct and in the right spot. it recently blew up but it‚Äôs been around for a while so noooo idea. My coworkers and I all play against each other lol LOL me staring at white men it is what it is Isn‚Äôt it fridays day early buddy lol wtf? it‚Äôs me not knowing that but still having kept tabs on them üò≠ wow, I take it back. Carry on buddy LOL what happened to it I have so many questions I hope it was an old phone so you‚Äôre not spending a lot of money so soon! what are you thinking of getting? Gives me sorcerer vibes. Human MC seeking ultimate power hopefully we get evil MC PB don‚Äôt be shy, give it to us. No checkpoints included. I‚Äôm assuming that it‚Äôs because it‚Äôll be available for Gen public in April which is a couple of months away. Girl in the preview is Val from TC&TF. She‚Äôs an LI option .img val I know what you‚Äôre saying and I think you‚Äôre right Bel. In comparison to nowadays, TFS literally showed emotion with every dialogue. Every time they spoke there was the flashing color with their mood. Unless it‚Äôs anger or sadness, they don‚Äôt really show much. Nowadays, it‚Äôs a scowl, half smile, semi frown and neutral. yeah, I took that as deadpan too She wasn‚Äôt offended but exhausted by her expected comment even reading the script has maybe 2-3 prompts but very random. don‚Äôt remember RCD like that but I do remember it being more expressive it‚Äôs just the newer books :/ I need examples lol I‚Äôm interested in what drunk looks like ?!?!?! oh wow also the way the heads are set up reminds me of that snake game on Nokia phones üòÇ Honestly yeah, when they frown for heartbreak scenes‚Ä¶ bro just draw tear or something MsM top tier Bringing it back Don‚Äôt worry about it, they don‚Äôt bother me Ahmed :) omg she does look tipsy idk how they‚Äôd do it but I wish they had side eyes or even an attempt of eye rolls. Poppy/MC would‚Äôve owned that shit do it again is this about Holly?? playboy bunny LMAO I meant Bel‚Äôs screen idk know her but I‚Äôm here for the bimbo aesthetic omg I love that video so much her laugh also reminds me of Cat from Victorious & himbos Never too many I can kinda hear it. She sounded like Ari mixed with Kim A stereotype of attractive, sex positive but dumb women. I. Fucking. Love. Her. Chrissy, baby. She a doll. that was me, I mentioned it Lmao IS THAT HIS ACTUAL NAME? say sike rn https://tenor.com/view/dead-zombie-me-waitng-for-a-love-life-gif-9573978 why they do him like that üò≠ I will. Someone gimme the ouija board, I got questions. this woman done fucked up his life with that name thank god he realized Beau was the answer LMFAO SHE THOUGHT SHE ATE LMAO this woman tried so hard to make him sound regal but then slapped on the most yeehaw last name this bitch is psycho she better be thinking of her actions down there she got lots of  time. A token straight that‚Äôs on thin ice üò≠üò≠üò≠ fucking funniest joke you‚Äôve ever made It‚Äôs an honor some claim the pope and but we claim the -bos we don‚Äôt do stupid we do naive goofy to the point I wanna slam my head yes name one street smart fact rn I‚Äôm timing you tic toc You failed I said street smart not common sense shit has been taught since we were 4. Street smart ain‚Äôt taught, it‚Äôs learned on the fly oh man layhurs‚Ä¶. Down bad. DENIED. WITHDRAWN. KAPUT. FINIDO. How you feeling? I planned on getting mine today but there‚Äôs a storm lmao I said sike. don‚Äôt forget to hydrate and don‚Äôt baby the arm. I never had symptoms after my vaccines and I really don‚Äôt want any after this booster. this pains me can someone scream chiropractor Thanks I know what it means Lol. that‚Äôs why you only go to professionals But I‚Äôm glad you know to vet. Makes me happy, Bel brainbo lay‚Ä¶ byeZ WHAT :dead: baby‚Ä¶ do you mean Peter üò≠ you know what I forgot that was his name I thought you were taking about Chris and I was like wtf but you right. Brian is the dog and I will go with it I was always more into The Simpsons But family guy is fun You know what a lot of people liked that I just couldn‚Äôt get into? South Park. I‚Äôve seen clips and some of the stuff is funny but like‚Ä¶ as a whole? Very shitty. and I like vulgar/crude/morbid humor the jokes don‚Äôt take much brain power I do enjoy the pop culture references not sure if they still do it, but back then those would get giggles anyways, yeah. That show sucked. Guys liked it and I only would watch some around them before zoning out miss thang wearing her mardi gra fit to deliver her baby dksfg a mood he hiding nuts "wah coo-eee?" I expect complaints not cause it‚Äôs rep rights but people make those same excuses for other books so why would they just stop for this Ya know what I mean I‚Äôm not sure what they‚Äôve said about this book but I think it‚Äôs not going to do anyone favors going in there with expectations. I‚Äôd have an amazing idea to pitch to PB but it would mean to step out of their comfort zone and switch up the themes that they‚Äôre used to I like it Mara don‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôll have a 3 second transition of when you press on the icon to it switching over to the app to start up. Useless and ugly. How did you not know this? Mara and I are bluestacks hoes THIS LOOKS LIKE BASTIEN. money moves :money_DV: TC&TF had violence and sex.
TF had sex and more mature themes (violence, blackmail, etc) I‚Äôll concede that HSS is the more wholesome series in the app but let‚Äôs not pretend it was all bubble gum and flowers with the OG books. The comment was a shift focus. The focus has always been the same. Make money. it‚Äôs just a game. you got 6 tries to guess the 5 letter word. it‚Äôs the same word for everyone around the world There is a share button lmao‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt pick the boxes in emojis üíÄ a jock who knows more than sports? gasp signed by a jock. Tom Brady retired so for sure. There‚Äôs a vacancy :) I‚Äôll sign him rn. Got Craft on speed dial Fae wants you give you Sinclair LMAO knew it üòÇüò≠ scooter PB didn't want the straight A student to become a jail bird how sad am I trippin or that star look diff..... it looks GROSS. it's differeent it is it looks skinnier but more rounded idk this is me with foundation lmao they‚Äôre sisters Pri üò≠ imagine being bitter cause a book that‚Äôs doing great got a sequel touch some grass. not touching bolas, but I agree with this list. I've tried to get into but it's slow-paced and I didn't finish. Mal is an attractive sprite but not enough for me to try again anytime soon WAIT I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THE ENTIRE THING LMFAO. TROY IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THEM. he's watered down asf FACTS I binged the book since I was beta VIP. so it was a fun read fb, reddit fb private groups are literally haters simmering in their hate pool it‚Äôs really pathetic you‚Äôll see the snippets under the official choices page comments. MM is a good choice. It was quite fun. I get that. I would probably start half of them and then never end it cause I'd jump to the next one released. you know who needs it more than him? yeah. get on that. adam babe, pretty sure fae isn't singling you your comment was the last on this page but I don't find them related since it wasn't an actual reply, you know? it's like if I just came in and changed the topic but instead of words, it's gif but they did say it wasn't so I would take their word on it. also, when is the next blog post? I need to confirm something. I acknowledged your confusion but explained what the sitch is I was gonna say that's far but then realized it's the first of the month. so make sense don't say y'all cause I've done nothing. that would be book based, not like the general insiders. the team review/comments omg interview, that was the word. I originally meant the insider email with lineup. SR will get the blog post in a few months cause the sequel is in the works. I need CH to be confirmed demon LI next week üíî it starts off rough, ends well. if you mean that one scene, it was scrapped. he's an animal, so like.... yeah. animal instincts. Morgan was a red flag too. they both end on solid notes. like I said, he was written to highlight his primal side. Justin is human and just an ass once it gets to the actual plot, hunters/werewolves, it was cool. MC is a badass. Simon was too sweet. I can't stand overly sweet characters so I had to choose Justin. Mary Jane's will be the death of me. idk what the male version of that is or any other version, at that. YOU CALL IT SUE? I just googled. wow. I hate it. Mary Sue. I've always heard as Mary Jane/Plain Jane... huh. fun. but yes. that kind of writing is not for me. it's the same when the villain has this insane masterplan like, normal people are villains too. it doesn't have to be that deep. oh I was gonna say I've seen enough divorce/custody battles where people are just assholes I liked his writing the spin about the clout was a nice touch who is craig I know ES OH Mr. America , yeah on this note, I don't like that everyone who disagrees with MC is a villain... let homie have their opinion and not disrupt mine lmao I like the buildup from grudge to hate though. make them resent me for a lot of things. layers complexity I wouldn't know. what are his reasons? I'm going to be honest, that doesn't give me enough backstory to agree he's a good villain. I'd have to know more about the trauma and psyche is he a well-loved character cause if he is, I‚Äôd agree it sounds a lot like pretty boy syndrome I know Landry is hated lol. Yeah aerin There it is. it basically means attractive people can get away with being jerks. and they‚Äôll be defended/supported for it. I would say Poppy got more layers than the people we‚Äôve talked about. That too I really dislike people tossing the word trauma around. When did it become the ‚Äúit‚Äù word would it be? I think tik tok trended it I‚Äôve seen post on both platforms and Twitter is more mental health advocating than others I‚Äôm not a tik tok fan aside for some jokes but they‚Äôre sent to me. I cannot be arsed to spend time on the app and find stuff DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THIS. The way some characters are described as abusive‚Ä¶ I will fucking fight. PERIODT. I wouldn‚Äôt agree with that either since he‚Äôs aggressive and primal. That‚Äôs just instincts. It was a whole plot point- MC trying to teach him the ways of humans. they were in a pack in the middle of forest. They avoided humans because they hunted them. They were not humanized. The Reagan abuse comments are so ignorant it burns. It‚Äôs the surface skimmers & hate train followers who share this insight. and anyone can dm me on this topic if they‚Äôre ready to pull on their big kid undies‚Ñ¢Ô∏è You said what you said üçµ I‚Äôll save you the trouble babe OMG I LOVE YOU me: it was me acting up.
you: Lu is the bestest. my heart is full This is what you‚Äôre getting on your bday is it accurate and you want to share it or inaccurate and painful? came in to say it‚Äôs not just a gen z thing yup Is that what they‚Äôre called now??? I don‚Äôt like these names. In the trash :ChillBar_trashcan: if you‚Äôre problematic, what am I? What‚Äôs the highest honor? blessed label me as you want biatches I‚Äôm just here His Wife‚Ñ¢Ô∏è THE Wife‚Ñ¢Ô∏è was it for emergencies only üò≠ with minutes me and Metta crying in Nokias mood. I got a razor in some drawer for emergencies Probs still got 70% of juice too the og sidekick Y‚Äôall will never know THIS WAS THE MOMENT LMAO you‚Äôre def younger than me. blackberries were the shit with popular kids lol 25. Walkman, Aim, and Xenga is how I age myself THAT WAS MY SHIT bread & butter literally can hear the dial up connection as I speak I was just cheap and did the Black Friday deals where you make a family account and get new releases and when I was on my own, I did the no contract and then traded in my device for new. Costco selling phones is so funny to me but then I remember that BJ‚Äôs does it Factory reset, log out of iCloud, and then off find my phone. You‚Äôll be fine. idk why I figured you had an iPhone but then just log out of accounts You‚Äôll get discounted if it isn‚Äôt bad not full price dude what are you doing to them I‚Äôve done some cracks and chips and they take mine Metta, that‚Äôs a brick. y‚Äôall just collecting bricks huh use it for the apocalypse Zombies should be scared of ME yes zombie: Oh no, I got the Lu!

It‚Äôs a factual statement lol ‚Äúok fine‚Äù is funny though. People can‚Äôt stand being wrong I was sitting pretty and eating my popcorn it's the end of discussion emoji. as it should. If I was their social media manager, I'd be more blunt. they can't afford me. but I'm really good at being professional. professional bitch. yes. you haven't done anything for me to be bitchy sooo you're safe. for now :) I respect it lol sounds familiar. wanna go to dinner? i know this great place.... click the link and find out cause not right to call out the user that explicitly he hasn't posted it yet LOL ,lADKNSFJ https://tenor.com/view/kristen-stewart-laughing-lol-laughing-at-you-laugh-gif-19297017 anyways shitty opinion and execution all around. he really tried it too https://tenor.com/view/spicy-seasoning-special-touch-signature-gif-15902626 as if they're not clogging up channels saying the same bs I am in this screenshot and I love it. Mara, it was the funniest shit ever. blocked everyone who called him out for his hypocrisy too sir was down bad. yup the only problematic thing related to SR is the so-called fans with pitchfork over it's existence & great reception. just don't talk shit about a book. people just need to stop trashing one to praise another. nothing is ever out of style lol, I mean that trends come and go. so eventually the those things will be used again in another format not me immediately thinking Golden Girls :(( AHHHHHHH it's so funny Will never happen to me Sam doesn‚Äôt deserve Hana, so I‚Äôm ok with this lmao this is a real give and take relationship with the necks ethan or giraffe I thought you meant high as in standing tall and I was like, cause of the undies duh I got it now Pru lol send them my way i love jokes snort coke!! girl got her whole nasal passage cleared sjdfhg change the topic point and a lot of you would be very offended.
