Theyre the ones from the last server I just wanted Yukkis permission before adding them since theyre his art Thanks :umiyay: Pretty much, yes We could just make an exemption list :KEKW: Amazing Locked for temporarily Visit this this link I was immediately suspicious that they didnt use my name because thats the usual telltale sign. Also because, as you can see, this was on iCloud and its in my junk folder :worry: No, thats technically correct My card expired last month It funnily enough reminded me I need to update my billing information genuinely on iTunes So thanks, scam! :UmiSlain: Why not I like how a lot of them look like memorials Also how Witness is cut off Witness: A Bodyguard....

The MC-sexual vibes are just too strong :kekwhands: Was there an actual 30 diamond scene with all five LIs Well, BB gave me that food Waaaay before then PB used to be really tame I reread TC&TF and was getting the smexy on with Raydan (god I miss him) and the scenes are so short and not that descriptive But I got to slam a door on Zenobia so alls good in a days job Did TF even have sex scenes or was I just poor I couldnt do TF after Kaitlyn cut her hair I just couldnt cope I think TF is probably one of the only series where character portraits change over time and I think most people didnt really like it That TNA scene at the party was :ashesweaty: Im so dumb, I thought you meant words as in they talked and not saying Caravaggio :kekwhands: The Adjective Affair sounds like some sort of teachers weird project that probably they worked a bit *too* hard on :kananhug: That scene when youre playing hide and seek and you just choose to make-out Dont... say its name... :gp_nobulli: I forced myself to finish it and now I have to do it again Why do I cause unrepairable damage to my already weak psyche Oh god, am I going to have to think of baby names Im considering Discord and Twitter so I can cause a war Unwanted and Sequel Im so sick of seeing that god damn sprite Nope, Maras going back to sleep.

None of that law with politics or law with business Undergraduate LLB Ah, we call it undergraduate Three years and then I look for criminology jobs I dont want to be a lawyer so I dont have to do two years of extra law school I wish I did law with criminology but hopefully with my optional courses being criminology and evaluation of the judicial system, Ill still be able to get a job in the field And also because I have a psychology A-Level It is for the most part I hated contract law It was so boring but I blame the lecturer more than the content I left most of his lectures halfway through Didnt even matter because I cheated the exam anyway Open source :Dabshe: Means you can use the internet and textbooks I want something to do with profiling but I need a psychology degree for that so I think its unlikely So Id rather do criminology which means studying what causes people to commit crimes, talking to criminals, analysing data and making anti-crime campaigns I think so, its not that hard considering I did drama so this sort of stuff is fairly obvious to me anyway And also farrrrr less competitive than being a lawyer Drama as in acting and studying of plays, yes :KEKW: Just remember the golden rule Its not on hiatus unless they say it is Thats a weird name to call someone ~~great time for me to pop a joke oh god~~ I suppose so Its something like x amount of EXP for each message you type after a two minutes period So if Firework just typed a message every two minutes It would be efficient Are you suggesting Firework is more popular than me :worry: Bruh I got QB out like less than ten hours after its release Give me some credit AND I TOLD YOU TO ASK FOR HELP :REEEEE: :REEEEE: I h8 u :monkaHmm: :catblush: *ahem* No homo :Dabshe: ||vag makes me gag|| Oh joy :quiggle: Banning Firework until I beat her in the rankings :nicoshake: Bish you cant ban the SpoilerLand 1 owner I MADE YOU I made you but I dont claim you This is the war between me wanting to go to sleep and me wanting to roast Firework Do you see my dilemma Oh yeah, Zak and I would just write murder fics about each other Because only the one that is alive would win :nyoo: This is why I dont claim you :KEKW: Shame, I guess its lost to the old server forever now Yeah :/ I hope shes doing okay And now Im the dictator :nicoshake: :gp_notlikethis: My servant Ksrdashion Oh MARA SAYS YES :nicoshake: I have the same birthday as Mussolini Why was he in a punctuation > in a comma Its coma Comma is , Greece abolished its monarchy on my birthday and Hitler became leader of the Nationalist party:aaaaaaaaaaah: Theres a lot of dictatorship stuff on my birthday Same birthday as Mussolini and Hitler makes a lot of big gains on my birthday https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_29 Oh, I think Van Gogh died on my birthday NO NOT THOMAS STANLEY HE WAS SUCH A LAD :kekwhands: He basically determined who won The Battle of Bosworth by betraying Richard III and fighting with Henry Tudor NO Petition to change :Anti_Ethan: to Duke Richards Oh yep, Van Gogh died on my birthday in 1890 Henry II born on my birthday lads :nicoshake: Never mind, its the French one Nobody cares about him :Dabshe: Im just celebrating all the things I share my birthday with Is that so criminal Same birthday as Mary Queen of Scots marries Lord Darnley Im so glad he got assassinated Is it really yikes when the man was a domestic policy genius Source - I studied him Also context for that piece- Hitler made all other political parties apart from his banned in 1933 So it was literally impossible to vote for another party in 1936 The 1% were likely invalid joke votes Yeah, actually One of Hitlers big policies was going no u to the Treaty of Versailles Would also have been better if the Weimar Republic wasnt such a spineless ruse Done :nyoo: :worry: :KEKW: * I remember going to Spain and I saw a bidet I thought it was a shoe washer Actually no I thought Either this goes up my ass Or it cleans shoes And I wasnt going to take that chance So do rich people have golden encrusted bidets instead of golden encrusted toilet paper in these bidet countries Wouldnt surprise me Rich people are strange Of course it does :nyoo: Id hope that its a pretty damn good bidet So whenever you go for a wee You use a bidet?

I know I should move past what happened but its difficult considering my childhood history trauma! Yay! 

I have a lot of issues with confrontation and rumours are definitely not something that I wish to have happen. Thats my main anxiety, but I also dont wish for anything to happen to anyone here or the server as a result of my actions. 

No, no, this isnt a resignation post (though I was close at one point :ashesweaty: ). The amount of support you guys have shown to me really means a lot to me and Im glad that youre all here.

I dont know what :MunchlaxMunch: means, Pri :worry: :worrynod: https://discord.com/channels/751463038602969229/751486790279626792/813850944982614027 :tabiwaitwhat: Huh Im so confused :KEKW: I think I know which one you prefer :monkaHmm: ...no Which is why youll tell me right now :Sadge: :nyoo: My :worry: is different so it wouldnt work anyway No :worry: :ivyStare: It sent as a movie :nyoo: PSA: I changed my icon Before you all freak out Since its spring :tabiwaitwhat: So my morning horror story: I woke up a few hours ago to go to the bathroom, I turn my light on and I see this: Why do they now have hats And the worst part is one of three things happened 1. I somehow went to sleep without noticing this happened before I went to bed 
2. Someone did this while I was asleep
3. I somehow sleepwalked and did this And I have no history of sleepwalking and I feel I wouldve seen this but :kekwhands: Turns out my mum did it before I went to sleep last night So I somehow just didnt notice she did this She said she was waiting all night for me to text her or say something but it didnt happen Yep :YEP: Hi Pri :cornfaded: Not even sure its a BLM issue at this point Theyd go nuts at any woman doing it, it just so happens Harper is also a minority :LanceShrug: Oh no, I definitely agree they need to stop putting POC in enemy/rival positions But I dont think the threats that Drew posted are specifically about Harper being POC and theyd probably be there even if she was white Maybe some of them are racially motivated, I dont deny that, but I dont think its the sole cause, if you get me Oh okay, cool :KEKW: :worrynod: You too :catblush: Reminds me when I was watching House- Chase was on the diagnostics team and left to pursue surgery. He could only help out a tiny bit and he had to quit surgery to join back to Houses team. So theres no chance Harper could be head of the department of surgery and work on diagnostics because of how urgent surgery requires you to be on-hand at all times If OH was to be at least realistic according to House, Harper would resign from head of surgery to permanently join Ethans team and then perform surgeries for the patients they care for There is a major conflict of interest. What happens if Harper is stuck in a super long surgery and the diagnostic team needs her? Even if she wasnt head of department and was just a surgical resident like Bryce, Im hesitant to say theyd allow it The doctors in House also had other minor cases and they prioritised the diagnostic team case over the minor cases For example, they also had clinic duties I watched The Good Doctor 1-3 and House 1-7 (need to finish 8) What I just dont get is why Harper Did they want to give her more plot relevance So why wasnt that explored in book one Heck, even book two Why is it in book three where Ethan is head over heels Speaking of which, who the heck is working on Blooms wifes case But he said he wanted us specifically, I swear Waiting for when Bloom fires all of MCs friends But the sun has set, Drew :aaaaaaaaaaah: That sounded so motivation for a second and then remembered its America were talking about :hawyee: America still living in the past I could go pissed as much as I want if it wasnt for COVID and the fact I cant be bothered to get an ID And also the fact I dont like alcohol :LanceShrug: :LoreleiGlance: Yes :catblush: Cant wait for Mashed Potatoes versus Roast Potatoes I only like roast Oh yeah, *chips* Mhm Wait until they know theres a very specific scenario and chip type where we do say fries- :KEKW: The Insiders this week was so pointless Didnt tell us anything we didnt already know for the most part Apart from GOC but that doesnt really apply to me, but I do understand its important to others :monkaHmm: Persephone Narcissus Ares Arachne Is he Roman But he was in Disneys Hercules :babyaaaaaaaaaah: Are you saying my favourite Disney movie of all time has flaws :kekwhands: :nyoo: How dareth you Drew Stop Youre ruining my childhood Im going to cry I learned about mythology through Smite Bye Drew Greece wasnt a country that took part in the, uh, whats the appropriate word Colonisation of the Americas It was most France, England and Spain How did you only just notice Nah, Id rather read OH right now than participate in a war My god, Im playing Witness because I was curious why everyone says Cassian is so good And oh my lord MC would be the worst person in quarantine Not even a day in the house and shes like yOu CaNt StOp mE Have a better phone :tabiwaitwhat: Its not whats supposed to happen and would really only happen if your phone is outdated Probably the best idea I had FIRE EMBLEM: HEROES! scream out of my phone in the middle of McDonalds once Scouting for Birthday Umi in ten minutes. The cult is in session THE CULT WAS A SUCCESS I doubt that actually works anymore :nicothinking: Thats surprising Thats gross I had to wear plasters when I used to write paper exams because I would get blisters I write cursive so those sorts of word counts will murder me Its not a word if I never take my hand off the paper :awauangry: My uni makes a word maximum instead of a word minimum, which Im grateful for The only time Ive had a word minimum (and maximum) was because they made it 875 max but then changed it to 875-1500 because they wanted to allow students more explanation Which is my EU law one :monkaChrist: :nicothinking: Cant wait until I never have to do exams again.. I mean Im in second year uni So Ill graduate in 2023 :HandsUp: Wait, do I graduate in 2023 Or 2022 :monkaHmm: I go into third year this summer 2022 then Pri might Im so sorry for you If I still wanted to be a solicitor, Id have to do another 2-3 of law school, which is another 20k or so of debt And Im not about that life :tabiwaitwhat: Fake You legally cant disclose interview requests, Im sure It counts as a breach of contract Very interesting that, for an exact message, the journalist didnt include their name or previous articles Plus who would want to read that Ill be extremely surprised if its real, Ill put it nicely It doesnt look right, does it Who is she? Ah Yikes And why you maintain a Choices fan account Like Why would anyone want to read that Who cares?? And the fact they have to emphasise exact message like honey, that doesnt make me believe you more Just lets keep the spoiler a secret bruh she said shes supposedly a fan of your account. She knows if its true :LanceShrug: How desperate do you have to be to fake saying you got an interview about Choices though I get that a lot, weirdly enough I dont see how that would necessarily help Draw more attention to how trashy you are, go off Its just so weird because surely youre supposed to take a profile on someone youre going to interview Surely youd see the sus stuff she posts I could but Im afraid Id have to kill you Looking at what Wired is advertising on their Twitter https://twitter.com/wired/status/1369748204712062986?s=21 I dont think this has the same level of journalism as Choices and its community Drews name is Andrew???? :jebus: :aaaaaaaaaaah: It works sideways and diagonally too :nyoo: :kotoriwave: I hate OSCOLA referencing so much And I hate EU case citations even more What I receive What I actually have to write Pisses me offfff What's worse Is that OSCOLA says for EU competition law, I'm supposed to use a different EU law referencing style But half the cases I'm using... don't fit that style So :nyoo: Wao What do you mean, its 14/3 today /s:YukariSmug: The Prime Meridian goes through England so I could go and dab on the hemisphere line :aka2Dab: Because were small as hell Instead, we split it between north and south My online brother figure is a northerner and 100% we could deck each other if we could But we also have tight sibling relationship :catblush: Drew Where is Drew @DaHomieDrew youre gay I need to ask you something Hes not here yet so dont speak too soon He went offline when I tagged him Im pissed DREWWWWWWW I NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOT KOREAN BOYS Boys Mara theyre in their mid to late 30s https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/426068383423791104/815983810692775936/unknown.png Everyone pick who they find hottest If you pick Leeteuk, I will ban you :catblush: DREW PICK THE HOTTEST BOY :babyaaaaaaaaaah: Oooh, interesting choice Siwon is the visual of the group I dont really care much about Cross Gene anymore I only care about SuperJunior WHO IS COMING BACK IN TWO DAYS :nicoshake: Cross Gene is pretty much unofficially disbanded Seyoung left and the three remaining members are in the army So Id rather love a new group that is actually releasing content and popular Yeahhh SuJu is on Spotify though Ill send the link https://open.spotify.com/artist/6gzXCdfYfFe5XKhPKkYqxV?si=YoBdYF0hRfG7EWoTBqxwoA Theres some sub-units of SuJu Which are 
D&E (Donghae and Eunhyuk)
KRY (Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, Yesung)
All of KRY are also solo artists
Super M but I dont really care for them
And the off different song, such as Leeteuk and Heechul or Ryeowook and Zhoumi Mhm From my understanding, theyre licensed to SM but they have their own music studio So they can manage that how they like Oh no, SuJu is very closely knit They have no plans to stop doing it Leeteuk wants to keep the group going for as long as possible And they all seem to share that sentiment And theyre having their comeback in two days https://youtu.be/kEo14-UOM80 If you want to see one of the songs Just got to skip forward a bit to when the MV starts No :catblush: NEW SUJU ALBUM RELEASE GO STREAM IT https://open.spotify.com/album/3qyzxavqOfixEPDfFCEMlH?si=WihvqjomRui0wXQ9eZg1jg Youre a clown This is actually quite normal Its to stop people buying alcohol and then drinking it randomly in the streets.

Going on Instagram as alraf_aveiro and AlJun_JayRin, they regularly post spoilers and assets for upcoming chapters. They are applying for the external writer position and I think they should not be considered as an applicant due to their controversial behaviour, including LGBT+ erasure, and them releasing spoilers publicly. 

They go by the name of Ally, which you can see here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CMUxzkQlMSn/?igshid=1dsv5316phufn

You can see their plans to apply here: https://www.instagram.com/p/CMy1AzblPET/?igshid=17voqtvme27lm

Shouldve used double protection:Sadge:  Honestly, it reads like youre saying youre sorry she wont be in college I think the issue is that young people dont tend to use the phrase expecting anymore to refer to pregnancy We just say aite mate am preggers But arent you a nurse? Thats probably more usual for where you work Expecting Its interesting No. Suffer. :kyuok: Did you add a space after the answer Looks like its on Moodle Which is character-specific, as far as I recall So if there is a space or something, that usually gets picked up I would message your teacher :kyuok: Just use Spotify Im such a helpful daughter Theyre out of town right now and they texted me theyre on their way back but I didnt respond because I was sleeping, like usual I thought Arcana had a lot of controversy Especially from the writers Unless Im thinking about a different game I dont remember the details because it was such a long time ago but I remember it being pretty serious But they did in the end, right?

And now youre trapped in my basement Most of the admins left, including Pri, and I basically didnt want to do SPL without her so I deleted the server Today, Pris Nitro expires. 

Happy International Pri is Poor Day I have been waiting months for this day Indeed Ew, imagine shipping Maya and Wright Thats kind of creepy Read the article brief in #announcements :sigh: Time to up the limit again Dont boo the sick girl :hildacheer: Ask Pri Question What is In-N-Out referencing Is it actually food go in, shite go out Thats really it? That was my common sense guess Hehe poo I like Peepopoopoo No, its shart Its moments like these that I realise why Im single I have no filter when Im sick Im as bad as Pri My pills are tasty They stop me dying from blood going brrrrrr But isnt it because a peanut allergy could kill you whereas lactose intolerance will just make you a bit gassy Stomach pain and attaching a toilet to yourself *deep breath* **POO** :worrykek: Peepopoopoo You got to use wipes Wait, how do you guys clean after a poo Do you use wipes, toilet paper, what I use baby wipes You cant just use toilet paper You got to use wipes Bruhhhhhh They literally call bathrooms restrooms like what You going to take a nap while you poo?

My ears Youre dumb Doctor: dont clean out your ears, youll damage them and could end up with hearing loss
Drew: how about I do that anyway Drew: gets tinnitus from cleaning how his ears when told not to
Drew: https://tenor.com/view/surprised-pikachu-pokemon-shock-surprised-pikachu-gif-15357817 Also Why do you people call them Qtips What is a Qtip Theyre earbuds BRUH THEY ARE EARBUDS Thank you Those are earphones My dude Google Yes Jeff Bezos installs phones into our heads Earbuds- what you use to clean out your ears
Earphones- what you use to listen to music
Earplugs- what you put in your ears to prevent water going in So why are headphones agreeable to you but earphones arent :nicothinking: America makes me sad Okay but realise looks so much better than realize Apologise Me neither, its just fun :ivyThumbsUp: Ill kick your arse The one thing I will concede on, okay Is ass is better than arse If Im typing, Ill spell ass but if Im speaking aloud, Ill say arse Because the sort of hard aass sound doesnt work with a British accent Funny thing is arse and arson doesnt rhyme when I say it :KEKW: Alliteration is when the starting letter of words are the same in a sentence, minus S Because thats sibilance Not when your English teacher beat the crap of it into you Is this an example or a statement Weird statement but hes really not that bad Hes just a sad lonely nerd Who eats seeds off the floor for some reason But like, hes a really nice guy If he actually got a girlfriend, I think he would treat her well Youre panic Hispanic but without the his Lets have a discussion about which Victorious characters are most dateable :KEKW: I used to simp for Beck when I was a kid but as an adult, Im not sure how to feel Because his relationship with Jade was so toxic but it wasnt entirely Jades fault either Too many red flags Id probably date Robbie but only if it was post-Rex on the show The worst thing is they never communicated Every time they spoke, they just argued And often pulled others into it They made Cat have a panic attack Like geeeeeez And the fact Jade got Beck a can of lemonade for his birthday Because she doesnt know what he likes apart from lemonade Jade: sings a song about fighting and verbal assault
Beck: holy crap thats so hot If they just communicated Beck would often shut Jade down too Like :Sadge: Jade was vulnerable with Andre And it was great I remember the ads for that episode I think Im in love with Jade! Can we anti-Robbie and Cat while were at it Cat was so manipulative to him Cat is dumb but she was aware that she was manipulating him I never really understood Rex. Is Rex actually Robbie or another mental entity Like Jekyll and Hyde? I always saw Rex as like another person entirely. He was just attached to Robbies arm Jekyll is the upstanding man of a respected society whereas Hyde is the social outcast who unleashes all of his primitive urges When they removed Rex from the show, it got better But I dont remember the actual reason for it I used to idolise iCarly and Victorious but nowadays, while I still enjoy it, it gives me a really odd feeling Its sad to think for fifteen years she hated what she was doing And I had no idea What happened to her? Wow Its strange how theres no investigation of this man You do hear a lot about predators in the media but very few ever get mentioned again after a week People forget what happened so fast that its like nothing happened Nobody wants to work with the problematic ones and defamation Sometimes it makes people more famous because now the name is recognisable Same but Weinstein Hell, I didnt even know who Trump was until he went for president and all the SA cases came out Him getting banned from Twitter was truly a good day https://www.reddit.com/r/perfectlycutscreams/comments/pqot2b/hospitals_around_the_world/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf KRAKENHAUS Ass He made me lose a finger :owoangi: I think most people had Imogen die, if I remember right Since she has a lot of scripted nerve losses Well, its whoever has the lowest nerve below a certain threshold, isnt it? I remember my second playthrough had Parker leave despite the fact he was my LI Which was awkward Has to restart :KEKW: Yep Encouraged He will come back for the pier scene and if he survives, he will disappear and leave the town for good, texting MC to never contact him again This is why you dont run Mac Im loyal to Apple but even I know the Mac is garbage Why does your Mac have arms Imagine if your PC just had arms and would bitchslap you Me: is 99% of the definition of a word
Also me: Googles just in case
PC arm: idiot You mean its not preganananenenntnnyt? Can you get pregante from using the Luigi Board? When my friends and I play Phasmophobia, we call the Ouija Board the Waluigi Board and when we find it, we scream WAAAAAAAAAA Me: *finds Ouija Board* WAAAAAAA
Friends: did you find the Waluigi Board??
Me: *muffled noises of me asking it questions and annoying the ghost* Ah man I fecking love Greggs Theres a Greggs outside my work Like not even twenty seconds If I do good on my weekly performance at work, they buy me free Greggs Why not just use Nox Its a bakery Its where Gregnant comes from Its great Sausage rolls :ateuknod: Im so disappointed in all of you Are you a troll
Me: yes
Pri: Im into that Remember realigning the pen when it got out of sync Pressing the Xs Oh no Guess I better start prepping for SPL3 Since Pri didnt explain, the last time Pri tried to run a movie night, it began the spiral that led to SPL1 being deleted Speaking of Bollywood films, I might start streaming Hitman again :nicothinking: Been wanting to play it again Pri was talking to me about watching some Bollywood film and she was trying to get subs While I was playing And she found subs but they were in the wrong language, I think And then she found English And I never watched it :kyuok: To be fair, Rangan is a Bollywood film producer Actually, the stream Im watching is ending Do yall want a stream :ch_blurryeyes: :ivyThumbsUp: Well be doing Bangkok SASO today, assuming theres no Elusive Target I need to do Is Pri going to force me to go to Mumbai Get your asses in #no-mic-chat I think that was one of the writers Im bored, does anyone want a Hitman stream Sure, one sec Oh god Megamind is an underrated and under-appreciated genius though The best film ever is Hercules Do you want to date him Enjoy some Halloween roles You went MIA, Zak left, Pri left because the two things before happened and I was left on my own to run the server and I didnt want to so I deleted it :kyuok: More or less Now Pris trapped in my basement Voltra is the basement Does Megamind even have merch I cant imagine it was promoted in merch that much We were planning to get KFC today but it was closed :Sadge: Megamind fandom Im not going to use mine anymore so Do you want it, Abyss? It means I banned all of you Was that when I had my :colorful_sparks: Breakdown :colorful_sparks: Surprised you didnt delete the server :KEKW: Since it was almost a repeat of SPL1 Something or other Was a fun time of my life How long was I even gone? Two months or so? Raven hasnt really said anything in forever And Bee I assume is busy Its only because of Pri that I came back You too When I left SPL, I became more active in PCF for a while He left the server now Same as Kyo, I think But yeah, I realised I needed a break after that fight with that editor Looking back, Im still embarrassed by it No, it was I shouldnt have acted like that Haha, Im glad to hear that Did you all make some sort of plot to get me back :KEKW: You so had a crush on me, Drew :kyusquint: :Copium: No, youre the Horny Hoe Big Bully Bui And I now have no channel at all Big sad Pretty chill, thanks for asking How the hell did you give me the Simp Squad role :tabiwaitwhat: Why do you mean it Arkansas But I thought I have a higher precedence over you so you cant give me roles Huh, okay You know, if we get enough boosts for server role icons, I can give people their favourite LI To appear next to their name So yeah. If anyone wants to contribute boosts, Ill give you a custom role to have your LI appear next to your name :ivyThumbsUp: Youll get it anyway since you have a custom role already No. It takes the icon of the highest precedent role I cant make custom roles for everyone so itll only be going to boosters We have to get the three more boosts to unlock it first :Copium: I could totally make this an emote :megadrian: Youre welcome And goodnight Someone give us boosts so I can give Abyss that role and emote icon Please do England doesnt exist I thought you guys knew that https://youtu.be/rkvbNDxRmgw https://youtu.be/9s2O65ZgR0Y THEY DID IT COUNTY BY COUNTY HAHAHA Get rid of Wales first Sheep shaggers My name is Mara :ivyOWO: When you realise the crown is going in the wrong direction of the eyes Snapchat freaks me the hell out which is why I dont use it I just realised your icon is Sachiko I made Corpse Party emotes :catblush: :ayumipat: :ayumistare: :azusabegonethot: :azusacross: :emilaugh: :inumarubliss: :kizamiheh: :kizamismug: :morishigasm: :nahosmug: :naomicry: :sayakafaito: :sayakashock: :seikogay: :seikohappy: :yoshikiuhh: :yukawow: Still have the hots for Kizami He can eat my teeth any day :ahaerun: || https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/6/6f/BoS-Kizami-teeth.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20180407174911 || :shyduck: Get yourself a man who can ||murder children|| and look good while doigng it The Wikia isn't loading the CGs, I'm  heartbroken oh my Well uh The non-TW version is A group of school kids do this charm called Sachiko Forever-After (I think is the name, it's been a while) which promises for all the group to stay together forever But if you do the charm wrong then you get sent to Heavenly Host which is filled with killer ghosts and the like And they have to try to escape somehow but it's like basically impossible Lots of ||blood, gore, agony|| and, most of all, fun!

Also me: no problemo Yeah, I understand Man He has his glasses on for the first game ||tries to kill himself|| And then was like nah, Im done with glasses Also Did anyone watching Squid Game look at Gihun and just. Think Markiplier the entire time I think it is the hair SEE IM NOT MAD Gihun looks like Markiplier who looks like Keanu Reeves Genetic basis confirmed I watched it in Korean but my dad watched the first six episodes in English. We had a massive debate about it when we watched the last three together but he eventually gave in and watched it in Korean His excuse was he didnt want to have to read And he kept asking me why the Korean is better and why it must be in Korean and Im just like because thats how it was intended to be watched?? But you cant understand what theyre saying thats not the point, you dont need to understand I think the only dub that was ever better than the original was Hetalia Saebeyok felt really strange to me ||I thought she was going to win|| HER I love her She really did Im glad she lived up to what she promised at least ||when she pulled that guy off the stepping stones, I screamed|| ||she learnt the technique from tug-of-war|| But theres a sex scene Pri is too young to watch :Copium: Let me see if I can even stream Netflix on here OKAY I GOT IT TO WORK I can now stream Netflix and Prime We aren't doing it today Yeah, I'll do it Saturday and Sunday evenings Because I have uni and work so busy busy So who wants to be pinged to watch Squid Game React to this message if you want to be pinged for when we watch Squid Game on Saturday and Sunday (approx 8PM BST start time)

Plan: Korean + subs
Saturday 16th- episodes 1-3
Sunday 17th- episodes 4-6
Saturday 23rd- episodes 5-9 British Summer Time (UTC+1) But when it gets to the 31st, Ill be using GMT again My plan is three episodes Saturday, three episodes Sunday and then the last three next weekend Yeah, I have to get up at like 7 on Sunday and Monday so I dont want to stay up too late Work at 10:30AM :Sadge: Pinned a message. Make sure you react, Lu, if you want me to remember to ping you I added the dates and episode plan I think Ill give the people who react a temporary role so they can access an exclusive voice and text chat just so we dont get anyone who might spoil or doesnt know what SG is Ill sort it all out tomorrow, I need to go to bed Its only when I start to go to bed does Pri start to really think about what time it is Speaking of scripts QB 6? :gp_modCheck: :nyoo: My norm is about twelve to thirteen but I can survive well on about six I feel a bit groggy no matter what but thats because my sleep quality is poor  for no reason But Ive been using a lavender spray and listening to rain ASMR as I sleep which has been helping Im partly to blame :worrykek: Server Parent role is appropriate All of them Yes And yes, I pinged you deliberately Episodes 1-7 are an hour and episodes 8-9 are half an hour Hence why the second Saturday has an extra episode Oh wow Ive given those who reacted to my message in the pins a role that allows them to access #movie-night-chat and the movie-night-voice channels Hope youre all ready for tomorrow Have to? why. https://tenor.com/view/of-course-sam-red-falcon-duh-obviously-gif-17383140 I guess we could start Sunday and move the days forward a bit if people arent opposed :ninodrunk: You test my patience so much Okay well, those who reacted to the message to join the viewing, are you guys okay to start Sunday instead and then do next week Saturday and Sunday instead? :keksweat: Youre lucky youre in India Otherwise I wouldve strangled you by now And next Sunday I need to not want to murder you and look how well thats gone :EvilHehe: Little does she know I read about ||torture methods|| in my free time Theyre interesting Jesus Christ, Metta, you must have the most roles in the server Voltra How dare you sibilance your name Genuine Gaius Gsimp Exactly Priyudi Pain in my Pancreas She hurts me that much No??? :Copium: I could be in bed right now but instead of that, Im dealing with you :kyusquint: For what :tabiwaitwhat: I usually start getting ready for bed at midnight :siwonstress: What have we learnt today, kids Pri stalks my timing habits How long until PB makes a Squid Game reference in a book And yet, Id read it Her parents trained her in competitive Squid Game Wait, does Dean actually not have a surname? :Copium: We even meet his family And we dont know his surname He was my LI I called him Callum :worrykek: Its not a reference Yeahhhhh I played it back when it was releasing :keksweat: I still remember how revolutionary it was when we started getting Saturday books Books four days of the week and like 6-9 book updates a week too And you would read all of them Sara, for your own sanity https://choices-stories-you-play.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Customizable_Love_Interests :worrykek: It took me a while to realise what the pun was The one I usually go for is Maralina SaBOOra Im on episode eight :yesungomg: :kotoriwave: Go back to bed Pri Do not open it No because if you open it :honkdisgust: I dont Okay but is nobody going to acknowledge what shes doing is illegal Its because she presents herself as the harmless, ditsy girl who can do no intentional wrong uwu I dont think MLF is a minor though I think shes like 21, 22? Just find the news article she gave a response to where she exposed her name, age, country and other things Shes 27 Probably now 28 Its good to see shes keeping the clown industry alive :PepeShrug: And she watermarks everything Ive emailed them twice about her and theyve not done anything. Think at this point they dont care Perhaps the issue is that shes in the Philippines. Hardest to issue legal jurisdiction compared to if she was in America Its more of a private law issue and a contractual issue You have a contract with PB where they allow you to access their public data for free but accessing their internal files is a breach of contract And thats between you and PB, not the state and you You would have to issue a DMCA and then they fail to comply with the DMCA for anything to happen, but that would have to be maintained in the Philippines which isnt worth the hassle If she were from America, it would be a different story, Im sure The irony is that this server is at much more of a risk than she is If PB discovers this server and decides they want to shut it down, Im in the UK which is closely intertwined with the US They issue me a DMCA and I have no choice but to comply Mhm Oi no, Im not having MM/DD in this server You use DD/MM And you even pinged me Youre on thin ice, Voltra Dont push me :ninodrunk: United Kingdom isnt a country So theres four wrong there instantly Thats dumb By a long mile :jebus: I wish me got money :KEKW: I dont get paid until the 29th :Sadge: Its $4.99 a month for a Twitch sub I got 2 So when I once lost like three teeth within ten days I was a very rich kid Have you though Think thats a bit :Copium: of you, Metta I don't think "all that good shit" is a Christmas movie High Attuned? I've never seen that before She's invisible Just a thought, since every book is now VIP upon release, would you guys like for books to be in the VIP section of this server before they get released to everyone and then moved to upcoming or keep them in the upcoming section and moved to the finished section when completed for everyone? That makes most sense to me Stuff like Queen B, TNA, books that were never VIP will be in Ongoing until they finish. Books that are VIP will be in the VIP section until publicly released, where they will be moved to Ongoing and then moved to finished when theyre done This Okay guys None of yall have excuses to not appropriately spoiler mark images Then update the app Or stop being smelly Android You need to load the photo and then tap it Youre not doing it right Well, guess it means only Fae and I are cool enough for it to work As I said Youre just not cool enough I get paid on the 29th:bongonico: Touch my phone and you give me the right to kill you Well, its my expensive phone and its also my property and my privacy I remember several years ago, my mum once went through my phone and I figured out because she didnt close the apps she opened and I lay into her Remind me to not allow Pri to make the next server icon I think ghastly is the word you want :jebus: Thats Gastly https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gastly_(Pokmon) https://tenor.com/view/deep-magic-lion-witch-narnia-dont-recite-gif-14879671 But thats Giovanni :nyoo: :honkdisgust: Technically, no Yes, there are poker scenes and such, but gambling has to have an element where you bet something with only a chance for a reward back MC never bets any currency the player has access to and the choices are predetermined Its not the same thing Nope because you never see any gain or loss Yes Dopamine and serotonin > civil or criminal liability IE ranges from a fine to incarceration Can she piss off I spoke about this before but TLDR it isnt worth the money to get the Filipino judicial system involved Im doing trademark and copyright law in the spring I just remembered my dream from last night I had a dream @Kaleen Bhaiya was being annoying so I said stop, and they said okay, dont kick me and then Discord mobile had this big Kick Kaleen Bhaiya button that took over my keyboard. Accidentally clicked it trying to get my keyboard back and they got kicked :haelaughbutcrying: For reference, I do not find you annoying :IDKher: Huh I need to do my uni work Will take me about an hour I am so confused Apparently Ive done the work I needed to do But I was so certain I hadnt Let me just double-check because I feel Im going insane Thats so weird I mustve done it Or the material just isnt available :kyuwhat: Whelp Give me five minutes. Mother needs me to change my bed cover :kyusquint: Kill him :Sadge: Im so bored I have nothing to do I live in England That should say enough about your statement Sounds about right :Susge: Sure, why not I got nothing else to do How hard can it be Time to Google what a polynomial is I see graphs I am scared Is polynomials just stuff with brackets and integers Oh, I know how to do those Thats easy COMING Auwustwine Im calling this my legacy :GaibooShock: I pinned all three iterations in #no-mic-chat I literally started crying from the second one Its just amazing how downhill it went I cant wait for the first naughty scene You have to stream the book now With Gaiboo Auwustwine I think so :nicothinking: Im basically free whenever on Wednesday Thats roughly when I have dinner So maybe an hour after that Do you think the Reddit would have a meltdown if I posted one of the other Gaius :nicothinking: https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/qfd9fp/it_seems_another_sexy_stranger_has_appeared_oh_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf My mum calls them gay :jebus: New icon, please dont freak out I may have just spent a lot of money on SuJu albums I sold all of my Aqours figures now So that shelf is now SuJu central ...You'd think that but no :keksweat: ~~I bought these if anyone cares~~ https://youtu.be/ULjCVKeYFyQ Please listen to Traveler by Super Junior KRY, you will not regret it And they sung that MV live!!!! No editing whatsoever!! THEY REALLY HAVE VOICES THAT POWERFUL But Bel They deserve to be everywhere Thats because its a different OS :siwonwhat: I can understand making a typo But *how* Im not sure I want to Uh huh Go on +Stupidity I think is what you want And +Disappointment Whelp Yikes Bit rude No!

Its just a weird area mixture of four different colours Central heterochromia, I believe :KEKW: Yeah nah, mine are consistent As expected, absolutely nothing Not really Yeah, I get tangles but you can honestly brush it with your fingers if it irritates you But my hair is fairly flat/wavy so it doesnt tangle too much *A little* :kyusquint: UK postcodes have either five or six depending on which postal area youre in UK postcodes are always two letters of the postal area, followed by 1/2 numbers indicating the precise area

Bel: Cursed. Why. Stop.
Voltra: Adds emotes she thinks will be genuinely useful, maybe a bit stylised 
Mara: Memes. Excessive emotions. Caps case is important, even in emotes People dont know Pri and I know each other (almost said friends, ew) and seeing two, supposedly, separate people posting Gaius-themed SW glitches would definitely confuse :siwonwhat: We only needed three boosts :Sadge: :hyukhearts: Yeah, I heard of it :tabiwaitwhat: But Black Friday isnt a holiday so Im confused why you would get a day off But that doesnt answer my question News to me, Im working Black Friday :SadCat: We dont celebrate Thanksgiving We as in the UK Just a reminder, if we lose boosts then we will fall to level 1 and we will lose the features of level 2, including role icons Which one is that? I'll see what I can do How's that? And let me know what colour you want your role to be (HEX code please) @unforgivablespelling Yours is done I assume you want Carter, Metta?

Thats what Pri said to me :honkdisgust: It was that picture before but *someone* changed it to Wii Sports Matt But its only like that until someone makes an actual banner :keksweat: Just has to be Choices-related :nicothinking: I havent got anything in mind I mean, if youre willing to provide us with banners when we change theme, youre more than welcome to make them theme-specific instead of an overall permanent one :monkaW: My idea was just SPL and surrounded by the staffs favourite characters but I dont know how well that would work :KEKW: Milque isnt staff Theyre a booster which is why they have one It would be Gaius, Olivia, Carter, Sonia and Bryce Whose is Aerin? *whose* not who Who is represented by Aerin Well Youre making the art So I cant say no :KEKW: :AikoPat: Have fun :ninodrunk: The banner dimensions are in #announcements , by the way GUESS WHO GOT STUFF I sure did!!!

Theres always people/bots who like every video so this number doesnt matter much anyway You need the dislikes to balance this out and find a reasonable ratio But dislikes are hidden so what :ankhaburn: I have no idea what this discussion is Ohhhh Well uh Im sick so please submit a memo of your changes Thank you :SadCat: Yeah, its just my ||period|| so my body said haha suffer I have cold-like symptoms Sore throat and headache Yes sir :YaySleeper: Yeeee :sadge: KERRRKKKKKKKRRKKM :yesungomg: No I It Okay Aku ending their message with a - and then Adam immediately coming in shouting made me imagine that it was actually cut-off in discussion Made me giggle What if I am your dad Who said I didnt like you :SadCat: Oh no, my bitch persona faded Goodnight I totally hate you all :hyukhearts: The worst part Is that I would actually say that Ill freaking cRY :monkaW: Sub-units See #deleted-channel to understand Probably https://t.co/e3GbpQIiMq Thats my friends https://twitter.com/maralinasakura/status/1466058248335896588?s=21 What the Why is it suddenly raining Its like proper pissing it down Roles updated yeah ok Was it I didnt read the planning process Ohhhhh So.. should I change it?

I finished Harry Potter My heart is shattered Broken I dont even care about JKR I just Snapeeeeeeee :kyucry: Most people do But I love him Theres a lot wrong with him but those who think hes, like, fully evil and irredeemable clearly didnt get his character The quote I read said he wouldnt have cared less :tabiwaitwhat: Not quite that far Yeeee It just makes me laugh because the books are always like yeah, hes ugly and a really bad person but my heart is like but what if thats not true Oh my god, youre right I guess I have a thing for questionably attractive men with even more questionable morality THEY WEAR VERY SIMILAR CLOTHES KFKRKRKRKRKRKFKFK It actually is Gaius. :haelaughbutcrying: I just want to love him Seriously The entire series I was like Wow, if he actually had someone to support him, to help him get over his feelings for Lily and spite, he could actually have been an amazing person If he had gotten himself a ME :wookblep: Because theres no doubt to me hes actually a good person, just that hes held back by the past And hes a very talented man And actually, *thank you* for not being like ew Snape because every time I mention I am in love with this man, I keep being thrown with how horrible and irredeemable he is :haelaughbutcrying: True, true https://tenor.com/view/drake-clapping-clapping-drake-high-quality-hq-gif-23598042 Anyway, time to write a 10k essay on why Snape is innocent brb ~~Im too lazy for that, I have a 2k jurisprudence essay to do~~ You know what Pinned a message. That is my work for tomorrow Severus Snape and Gaius Augustine: Same Tragedy and Why I Simp For Them: an Illiterate Essay by MaralinaSakura Dont come back :akyuwave: y'all I am thriving Watching HP films and Snape in a long coat, scarf and jumper :HandsUp: okay but my man in the clothes i love mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm feast :teukwelp: See I could make a pun with your name But that would almost involve the c-word But just know its there Yeah, Im too tired to rebut M I L K that is all You will never be owner of this server :kyusquint: Oh hell Give me a minute Why am I putting effort into this It is done @Priyudi Enjoy If you disagree then it means more of him for me :catblush: When it comes to accepting my simping rights I am okay I did say I was going to do it Did yall actually read all of it :KEKW: Okay, so Im watching the third film Another reason why Snape is unjustifiably hated When Lupin turns into a werewolf and begins fighting Black, Snape literally charges forward and acts as a human shield for Harry and Co. He even takes a full werewolf slash to himself to protect them And even then, he doesnt stop trying to protect them I know Snape is the one who outs Lupin as a werewolf but Hermione says that they wouldnt learn about nocturnal creatures for several weeks But that essay was what taught Hermione Lupin was a werewolf How I see it He does small bad things that kind of suck but overall, doesnt really hurt anyone but when he does good, its amazing and takes away from the small bad He was willing to die or get seriously injured in order to protect them from Lupin And then all the stuff he did to help the Order Hes just such a misunderstood character :sadge: bro You know what sucks Snape is so hated so theres basically no MC x Snape fics Actual crime If only people bothered to look past Snapes small bad and look at his overall good Now that I can agree with :KEKW: Sirius over here like: :teukwelp: HONESTLY Reading that last chapter made my brain go what And I didnt even skip to it Truth :keksweat: Hes going to get bullied Hello Frat Welcome to the Snape Redemption Justification Channel Nobody is unredeemable If they truly regret it and leave their past behind for a greater future then you should let them When the world is the only thing holding them back, its no longer their mistakes but peoples grudges It is kind of weird Whelp, movie three done I like the movies with lots of Snape scenes :SCWhehehehehe: So I guess Half-Blood Prince is pretty high up there since thats the Snape book I just dont know how Im going to cope when Snape dies It was bad enough reading it But seeing it? :keksweat: I had to put off reading the books for a month because I could barely do it NO I KNOW ABOUT THAT :yesungomg: I havent watched it yet either Slytherin by choice, Ravenclaw according to the quiz My god, so true That makes sense, actually I just want to be a Slytherin so I can see Snape  Need to do a HP character tier list but its how much I simp for them I have a big semi-circle of

Villains
People who die
And villains who die 

In who I simp for BRUH SO TRUE My awakening Realising I no longer like people my own age I only like mature men Honestly How are these people younger than me now :SadCat: Harry being like Im seventeen, I can do what I want like no bitch, sit your ass down I feel that I did it Me too! Lockhart is so good I think I just have a thing for men who will clearly change for the better if they just had someone who honestly and genuinely loved them Get someone who loves him for him and not for his fame :yesungpray: He wont have to play around and be confident for them and would come to realise theres so much more to love about *himself* than fame And he would eventually learn to place fame much lower down on his priorities, settle and make that shampoo brand he always wanted Yeah! I mean, he has genuine skill. He may have stolen the ideas but he wrote them down and its his works that made him popular. He only said he did it because he didnt think his books would be as popular if people didnt think he did it but I dont think thats true Couldve easily been actual textbooks too since they contained real information I just feel bad for him I imagine him to be actually really insecure So yeah, I actually really admire him and thats why hes top tier simp list Like, if I was his girl and he told me all of his books were stolen stories and he wiped the memories of everyone I think I would be weirdly understanding?? I would think what he did was wrong but I would understand and sympathise with it And the fact he told me means he trusts me a hell of a lot Would I ask him to expose himself? I dont think so, but I would probably tell him to not do it anymore and change how he writes to be authentically him and be more realistic with his fame Thing is is that when he was in Hogwarts, apparently he was incredibly smart and gifted Particularly why Snape and the older teachers hates him because of that AGAIN THATS WHERE THE INSECURITIES COMES FROM hes insecure!!!!!!!!! He thinks he needs to be someone else in order to be liked when if he was just himself, he wouldve been amazing :SadCat: Oh my god.. I think he just solved Lockharts character arc I think I love him even more now I want to love him As for number three in ultimate simp tier I dont know what to say about Lucius I can justify Snape and Lockhart but I dont think theres much of an underlying good character for him except that he very much loves his family I think that was evident :KEKW: I think I blame more his upbringing morals than himself? He was just doing what his father taught him, but when it came to it, he abandoned those morals for his family Like, during the Battle for Hogwarts, he was frantically running around trying to find Draco instead of fighting And when it was over, they were sitting at one of the tables crying together Despite them technically being the enemy Precisely Narcissa pronounced Harry dead even when she knew he was clearly alive just to know if Draco was alive I think Lucius wouldve done the same I feel I now need to make an amendment to include Lockhart :KEKW: The man is a genius But he doesnt think hes good enough for anything :sadge: I dont know if Id call Lockharts stuff very little I keep getting this Hogwarts Mystery ad which implies that you can date Snape But I know it's too good to be true Shes not even fully transparent I hate that :AAAAAA: Jesus Christ I dont know, the hamster is pretty scary too :kyuwhat: You mean did I add the emote? I added the hamster, yes :angrysam: Go back to sleep and continue dreaming my Snape x MC x Lockhart fan-fic +Desire MAX Me: :nicosleeper: 
This channel: 300+ messages Im not scrolling up but were yall behaved I approve What do I get if I win I paused the film to pee and this feels like a mood, I don't know why I literally do not understand the point of gift cards "Here's a bit of money but ONLY for this ONE specific store" Like, why not just give me the money period Oh man I remember when Dan and Phil were a thing My teenage years are crying They've said multiple times that there isn't anything romantic between them. There was in the past but that's the past TikTok is horrendous He chose war that day Why must I be sexually attracted to me n ugh I love them so much but my god, are they useless :MARAONLY: I don't really need it anyway I have Snape You're an incel Someone hold me back I dont care if you disrespect me But you do not disrespect my men Do you guys ever think about how I could be the Chosen One Think about it Harry was born July 31st, Neville July 30th I was born July 29th Its a sign No freaking way Marchtember 32nd Novuary sounds like a part of your ovaries Yes mate Didnt you know Too late PERIOD RELEASE THE WATERFALL I finished last week Pregamanananananant Wait Are tot actually pregnant LU??

Jesus Christ, I accidentally posted this in my essay It's ironic that I spend most of my time interpreting Snape and Co as being good people And trying to make a way to make them better oh my god is that how im going to understand dworkin's theory of interpretation It suddenly makes sense :kekhyper: :MARAONLY: Honestly, I am so stupid as a person but when I have moments like these where my stupidity makes me enlightened, I feel atop the world What if Dworkin was just talking about simping and not the law One of the skills I pride myself on is my ability to multi-task I can do like four things at once without issue Bit late for that, I graduate in June I already spent 28k on it so I kind of have to now Im at uni, Lu :ninodrunk: Lu, how old do you think I am :monkaW: Answer the question, Lu This I am twenty I hope you didnt hear that from outside this server Yeah, Im in my third and final year of uni now and its like 9k a year Im not going to go to law school; I cant be arsed Straight law Yeah, I basically get an overview of most of the major law and some chosen minor law areas Per year Yeahhh, it sounds cheap but Tories are making it ridiculously low to start paying it back Its currently something like you need to earn 27k+ a year to start paying it back and the Tories want to make it 20k.

MC isn't in a house because she never attended Hogwarts She was homeschooled She is the Minister's daughter so he made her learn everything at home privately through high profile wizards and witches Very much so That probably won't be for a very long time since this story has three arcs in it Pretty much I'm particularly looking forward to the next chapter No spoilers for Pri but there's a lot of important stuff coming My god Im going to sound so weird but I needed a piss at uni and the building on the way to the bus stop I usually do it in was closed So I went to the newer building a bit behind my route Look at how nice this bathroom is????

Doubtful. Whats wrong, Frat? Scared of the Scarf of Sexual Preference? Headmaster Maralina has tested positive Mara feels like shit so if the April Fools stuff hasnt changed in time then uh tough luck Forever remembering how bad the Wimpy Kid recast was I do kind of feel bad for the new actors because its not their faults Yeah, I personally dont want to remove it but I wanted to make you guys aware in case you were, for lack of a better term, offended by it being here So I gave you the choice Plus its the vegan argument Why bother going vegan when there will likely never be enough vegans to change anything properly Why bother removing it when there wont be enough people removing it for the creators to feel an impact I guess if the bot isnt doing anything in your server you could but our system relies on it :Sadge: :yesungkek: I couldnt live without my SuJu emotes How else do I tell someone Im waiting for them without posting :kyusit: Religion is for scrubs.

Christians: but not the gays?
G/J/W: Including the gays
Christians: So not the gays, got it Here comes Lu's hot take Come on out, girl I'm the exact opposite in that I don't give a crap and that's what made me Atheist. If others want to be religious, by all means! Just, uh, don't rid someone of their literal humans rights while doing it, okay? Think it's somewhat the same issue here, funnily enough. We have the NHS but things like that have been privatised (hey look, more damage by the Tories). My mum had surgery several years ago to improve her... undies after giving birth twice to make sure there were no loose ends and I think we had to pay for it Bro, I want to get my ovaries removed so bad because I plan to never have kids and my doctor, every time is like wAiT a FeW YeArS beCaUsE yOu mAY cHanGe yOuR mInD Like BRO I don't even want to be alive, you think I want a kid to take care of and be alive too?? I can't go into specifics because it's private but bless my guy for being so understanding on my position for not wanting kids and how to proceed with that Think of it this way, government Give me the  or I'll wind up costing you money in benefits x Adoption is so much better than pregnancy anyway??? The world does not need more kids Since when has blood meant anything Me noting this down for when the Tories abolish the NHS This was basically me when creating Ruberion- I have a Wartortle plush on my bed that Ive had since I was like god, an infant I remember having it when I was like five so probably even longer I have two Eevee, a Vulpix and a Squirtle somewhere too Fellas https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/twsfzo/this_guy_always_offers_great_advice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Is this guy cute Watch the actual video, dont just look at the preview Everything about him is cute apart from his nose If he had a slightly better nose then Id be swooning Why do I feel you're speaking from experience, Drew? My mousepad cost like 12? :KEK: But I've had it for four years at this point, I reckon It's held up really well I remember when I bought mine my dad had a whole thing about questioning why I needed one And I said it's principle Severus? :nicowoke: My god, his last name is Severus You know who else has the name Severus- HE SURE DOES Because I care so much about TRR to remember some guy's surname https://tenor.com/view/dance-dancing-cute-ace-cheer-gif-16720867 Bought meself new work clothes You love to see it The cardigan is made out of alpaca wool Welcome to Superdry No I need to figure out how much free stuff I've gotten from them at this point Yes, I work there 639.50 in free clothes Not including the regular clothes I've purchased and got discounted but I had to pay for Oh yeah, I got a winter longline from there and I love it to Hell and back We do 8-16 in women's I think US sizes you just add +4 to UK sizes So 12-20 https://www.superdry.com/womens/jackets/details/178978/longline-everest-coat-black This is the coat that I got Yeah, I enjoy them Oh yes, I have heard *very* good things about our jeans Never bought them myself as I'm not a jeans person but we sell them so fast when we get them in :A_HuThumbsup: That's $835 for you Americans Yeah, that looks like the Expedition line from a few years ago Always recommend Expedition for travelling Wrong https://youtu.be/-uJHlgkIb_s?list=TLPQMDgwNDIwMjJadGbpuzib9Q&t=243 But can you do this in GTA (specific timestamp) You just throw it At people Equip the screwdriver from the items menu and then hold right-click, move the mouse until it locks on someone and then click Sounds like a you problem :ShizuTPose: Besides You can't be too mad You got to read AFY today Me: *looks at chapter nine plan* hahahahahaa oh dear You've just ruined my life Before I moved, I saw electricity poles everywhere Non-stop And since I moved a few years ago I can't remember the last time I saw one From a village to a town that really should be classified as a city In a place Don't know why you need to know :ShizuTPose: It's an hour's drive between them That's all I'll say Did you guys know I hate law Especially trademark law Nike, a reputable shoemaker, wishes to bring a claim against the art directive MSCHF for trademark infringement under UK law. Nike must show there has been an act of infringement committed (infringement in law) and that the act committed falls into the scope of protection the trademark has (infringement in fact). MSCHF has committed an act of primary infringement as they are offering Nike-branded products for sale on the market.  Furthermore, the infringing act must be committed without consent from the registered proprietor and be committed within the UK.  Nike has not given consent for MSCHF to sell this product. Additionally, as MSCHF is an American company, it is likely the shoes were sold online. For a website to target consumers in the UK, a consumer must be able to order the goods on the site to an address in the UK and pay in GBP.  It is presumed this is possible for Nikes case. There are further steps that must be proven for there to be trademark infringement. Most substantially is of S10(1), (2) and (3) where Nike will have multiple options of how to proceed. MSCHF may also have defences against Nike. Both elements shall be evaluated to give Nike the best chance of success in their claim. :ShizuTPose: Introduction time :pepevibe: *law* That reminds me that AFY has gone past 100k words Thank you, boo :SCWshake2: Hoi Read that as morning dew Look guys, it's morning d~~r~~ew E g g They moved my work day from Sunday to Friday for it :agony: No, their name was NSFW So I removed the embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZznc_t44L0 Because my Snape fic is now completed and fully published and I need to fill the void Imagine earning enough to have to do taxes :ShizuTPose: :MARAONLY: There is no Ruchalution Sometimes I doubt Im really British and then I do things like this Let me just Record a video Enjoy I really embraced my inner chav bloodline for the second half @Priyudi :SCWshake2: Dear valued customer,

Pri: I used to While weve all been talking about the new server, Insider got released Its definitely some sort of office It works! Just if you think your comment would upset a real person if you said it to someone, dont say it I romanced Bucket :stickbug2: I have stick bug-cket :UmiSlain: I didnt like them either Yall should see the god damn essay I would go to warm them about spamming but it had usually been a while since they said anything so it didnt feel right We all have to protect Firework Quick, make a human shield :nicosmack: Sure thing Official Asskicker of the server :nicothinking: Isnt there a role cap North Maralina :quiggle: hahahahhh :worry: She uses the same face as Britney, yes ,im Choices Britney ,im choices robin Wrong Robin :REEEEE: ,im Choices female Robin There ,im Choices Jocelyn Hmmm I think its just Britney The hair is similar to Jocelyn, I guess Is Zoey really defined as unsupportive? It was only for one chapter I think it would only count if theyre as an unsupportive role for five chapters or more Thats fair I eat so much pasta that I should really be considered an honorary Italian #bots-and-pets-uwu You guys know this Michelle is POC? Michelle from ES? Is it bad that I just dont see race I dont see oh its a white person its a black person its an Asian person I just see oh its a person  Hopefully I did it right Do you like what we did with the placeeeee So how long until SpoilerLand v3? I personally came up with #shark-tale-movie-remake Rising Tides Goooooood :monkaSteer: :LusamineLurk: mara cant come to the phone right now please leave a message after the beep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep As I'm sure you've guessed by now I am not good at doing my job :LysitheaSmug: I know, I'm actually the best :KEKW: I memed so much about my confidence that it actualoly became not a meme sometimes Hey no, I'm the dictator on this server, not you I can ban you You can't ban me :UmiYayGlare: No, this is a Maratatorship :UmiYayGlare: :KananSmug: Life is never fair in a mutiny See, Voltra knows to not challenge me Yes? No No Yeah, I think we did You're ? :NicoSmug: I knew Spirits was a great person Uh Thats the one I checked after I sent it :UmiSlain: Because You are If they actually want it then I dont mind giving it for a late day But You have to change everything back Since youre so adamant about it Well, if you two want it then let me know If you change anything, Pri has to change it back or shes banned and we never do it again I can tell youre regretting coming back :KEKW: :monkaHmm: Too late ~~its not but just let us know~~ Responsibility and Pri dont really mix She has her founder role. Thatll do for now :worry: Were stricter for good reasons :UmiSlain: How you guys behave determines how we have to take action If youre all friends and lovely then we wont have to moderate things so much If youre constantly trying to kill each other, well have to be stricter I already gave you the compromise, Pri She means the nicknames :worry: We had a lot of people saying they didnt want their nicknames changed And it became a hassle with that The issue with making a role is that the role would have to be higher priority than birthday but birthday also has to be higher priority than other colour roles So theres not really a nice way of doing it > How about make the non-nickname participants have a grey role
I know how to do this but its still a role that has to appear in front of everything else and itll just look so tacky :worry: > When Mara uses that emoji it makes you feel like youre in deep dodo
Oh good. Glad I can make people fear their actions just from that Awwwh I really feel like Grelod the Kind sometimes :gp_WorryWeird: :UmiGayGif: I dont even know how to access global emotes :HauCrab: :crabrave: That doesnt mean its global Hold on WovoYayy Get out :getoutofhere: Why would you give Pri the ability to make more chaos You guys may have emotes :pepegun: But I still have gun :quiggle: My autocorrect changes talk and tall to yall So anything is in the table at this point There really needs to be a dont change words that are in dictionary option for autocorrect ....Hinglish I know :KEKW: :nyoo: Are you calling me a slur :pepegun: I was kidding :worry: I mean She would If triggered enough Speak ENGLISH YOURE IN AN AMERICAN SERVER :REEEEE: That hurt me to write even as a joke, Christ almighty Okay but seriously English only :worry: I went camping and caterpillars decided to live under our tent so the chickens kept trying to come inside We have the assets for the familiars You could probably print like 200 of those for like $5 In a smaller size but thats still two hundred Tims If I can easily print it cheaper myself with probably as good or almost as good quality, why would I spend quadruple the price Yep Plus shipping will be far less because shipping outside the US is absolutely shite Genuinely, I was looking to buy a keychain from Love Live The keychain was like $4 Guess how much shipping More or less, yeah At least England and Japan are having a customs trade deal so I wont have to pay any customs in future between them I wouldnt buy Choices merch but I am fully invested into the Love Live merch stuff Le cabinat ~~thats just the cabinet stuff~~ I have far more stuff on my shelves :KEKW: I cant wait for my neso to arrive in October For reference, the new one is as big as the one marked Santa SDS These are my two out of cabinet nesos The one in the cabinet is extremely rare so she stays in there (and I put a hat on her) Oh no, dont do that, youll ruin the stuffing distribution I literally got tweezers and removed any hairs and grains from them I could find Anything for best girl Im very wary of machine washing nesos Its fine to do but it takes a lot of work This is whats on top of that box which I hope to get more stuff for. But right now the keychain and the fan have fallen over :aaaaaaaaaaah: Ah yeah, I went to a clothing store with my mum and we were going to the till I saw the box, didnt even know if it was for sale, was like can I have this and they gave it to me for like a fiver Its a very good box. It keeps my cards inside Uh, its technically one of three boxes, I guess :nicothinking: The Fire Emblem cards are inside the box you see on the left on that picture And I have other cards inside the Umi box in my cabinet Someone remind me to take new photos of my shelves because I need to My newest ones are from before my cabinet Nah, thats my drawer My room has been rearranged since then too I have more straps now and more coming sometime whenever Getting all this from America in a split box with my friend :UmiSlain: :umiyay: Its funny because it was originally meant to just be the top two sent in a letter to someone else who would send it to me And then my friend was like I want to buy stuff too So we made a joint open order So itll get shipped to him and then to me Its been put on hold because of Corona though :kananhug: Ma $200 of anime merch :kekwhands: :nicoshake: I mostly want the Umi Vanguard plush because thats by far the most expensive thing in there and its been scalped to death Oh, I trust the seller 100% Shes one of my closest friends Its just the issue if it gets lost during transit :UmiSlain: Were still waiting for a good time to send it Issue is that 1. Were still waiting for some stuff to arrive and 2. There will inevitably be a second wave of Corona in the UK :nicothinking: Its definitely going to happen here, unfortunately :KEKW: Imagine closing places Here, they stay open no matter what! :nyoo: Why are people so Stupid Its a mask There was one in Trafalgar yesterday Absolute mess Thank you :nicoheart: I ordered mine from Argos Was like 200-300 The lights are custom My dad installed those himself Yeah :nicoshake: Thanks :nicoheart: Arulu squad :monkaHmm: Bish What did she do Oh Wait what https://tenor.com/view/step-back-bitch-crab-knife-gif-5128633 That crab after Pri stepped on it Lmao I used to play in the sea a lot when I was a kid And now I think about all the broken glass that could be in there How I never cut myself, Ill never know Can I be the one who says that I dont think stone beaches should count as beaches But they hurt Ive never seen a waterfall :kekwhands: Wait, oh god, I just realised my passport is expired or will expire soon Ill have to be the only one in my family who has a Brexit passport Ill have to have that ugly blue passport which is made *in Poland* So much for taking back our economy :nyoo: You read me You photographed the boys working on Winter

|| Hana: dead by crushed by a ski lift
Maxwell: died by crushed by a giant squid
Bertrand: died by disappearance (presumed dead after Maxwells death)
Drake: suicide 
Liam: crucifixion via glass in a car crash
MC + Lilly: death in car crash|| I left MC and Lilly ambiguous Theyre still in PCF I could grab them and reupload them here Mhm Ill do it as soon as I finish with uh Business :quiggle: Okay, all three fics are up in #creative-land Enjoy I was working on an actual "book" called Agents of Gemini, I had the characters, lore and story all fleshed out but I just couldn't bring myself to keep going Well, Pri leaving was a big hit to my motivation but also because of the gigantic heatwave that just made me turn into sludge I was tempted to start again And then you left And I was like Yeeeah okay, bin I feel like writing another death zzz Give me a character Are you trying to make me do part 4 :UmiSlain: You know what Time to kill Olivia Guess I'll kill you too Hmm, Olivia is very prideful :UmiHuh: I love you enough to make you emotionally suffer ...sure How do you spell Olivia's kingdom Nevrakiz or s I thought s I wish I got money from this I already killed lIam #creative-land You'll see who I killed :quiggle: Would you like it to be so?

Hes brave and tries to be involved after he recovers from his hesitation. Hes very comforting and he cares a lot It was refreshing Plus I could actually see myself being with someone like him, perhaps I know he and Carter arent exactly the most popular IL LIs but I like them a lot Raydan will always be first to me though :nicoheart: Not Carter Ive got QB on my brain Freaking Parker :kekwhands: Mind empty. QB variables only I think since BLM, hes gone down a fair bit Because of ||ACAB|| but Id rather we not share opinions on that But I know Danni is quite popular and Tom is popular among the gay community Oof I do tend to pick the most popular LIs considering Im a cishet female But probably for different reasons Nah, I expected her to be the least popular by a fair margin She dies in most peoples playthroughs Paxs existence Because hes her LI And I dont like Pax and I only get to see him with Pax Its a negative association Im just Going to post a bit.ly https://bit.ly/3nevpyA Please do that in future You just go to bit.ly, post the link in the shortener and then use the link it provides you Can he be a spoon instead?

What is it? Primarily to prevent spam but also as a bit of a joke Also, I know things have been hard for you but youve been kind of passive aggressive lately. If theres something you dont like, then you can voice it a bit nicer. Its more relating to the kind of eye-rolling, kind of being a bit front forward, if you catch my drift. You may be one of those people who can be quite direct with their feelings, I am too and I wont criminalise you for that, but please just keep in mind that were all trying to have fun here. If you have a problem, you can always DM one of the staff and we can talk about it more privately where you may feel more comfortable saying how you feel. I just want to make it clear Im not having a go at you, just want to give you some options and understanding  :kyuok: I think you misunderstood. I was trying to be sympathetic when I mentioned the personal problems. We did listen to their comment about feeling excluded but they are also going about it the wrong way with the emotes, for example. Its not fair to other members to have to feel awkward and put down when Fae also has an equal chance of being involved. Nobody ever said they couldnt join in and theyre always welcome to. All I intended was to bring to their attention that they are being a bit passive aggressive. They arent in trouble but it has been noticeable. Thats all. Youve been a bit passive aggressive in a few instances in the past. I wont deny that perhaps that swayed my perception of what you said today and I apologise for that. I should have DMd you instead of making it a public spectacle. And you do have a point that it is unfair how I pointed you out alone. Im sorry for that. I hope we can both move on and learn something Were all still novices in the managing department and we make mistakes and Ill admit this one. I hope you can forgive me for that :haewelp: Gaius :kyuok: And we can call him Gaibot Lazy Because all of the petitions for other books did *so much* Remember to turn off pings when you reply please Did she do that too? God, people are so.... geez Now I think of it, why are there so many medical-relateds ads Wow, An*drew*, how could you That is actually demonic :KanataWoke: But didnt they put a skip option and a massive trigger warning on the ||arrest scene|| What other issues are there with it then Despite having three books, I always forget RCD exists Isnt it because Olivia has always loved Liam so it would be difficult for her heart to move to quickly Thank you, Drew :worry: Sharing MLF content :worry: It is a pretty good cover though The account owner Thats their name MinLarco Fan or something Also Who the hell do they think they are? Youre not in trouble, dont worry Its just that MLF isnt a good person. Theyve done a lot of sus stuff I know right? Why do they think they have a monopoly on spoilers from a tap tap game TLDR LGBT erasure amongst other stuff I forget It still says on her Instagram tag so it works to still call her that I mean If youre a LMF supporter, I will ban you from the server Since she advises LGBT erasure and I wont have those who sympathise with it in the server Sam watches you intently as your soft hands wrap around the crinkly package of the food. Their eyes darken with desire as you use gentle force to open the bag. They gulp watching you take a singular crisp from the packet and place it in your mouth.

She applied and I whistleblew her account so she wouldnt be considered I just dont know what goes through her head The only problem I really have with her is how hypocritical she is If you want to publicly post spoilers, fine, somebody was going to do it anyway. But dont get upset and moody when someone reposts them and you get caught And dont??? Watermark them?? Isnt the point of watermarking so that when it gets reposted, people can find the original source? :jebus: I wont let her What :jebus: I screwed her over is what I did Oh my god :boi: Was that the dont talk about abortion because its against my countrys religion guy :KEKW: Still got to follow the rules but that guy really did rub me the wrong way Good Vine Im in me mums car vroom vroom https://youtu.be/-SjPVVeNdKY Why is Vanessa blonde now :IDKher: Such as? 1001 is the Chinese version, yeah :poihide: ~~Me clicking the top option~~ Im going to be unhappy with all of them so I may as well be rich It doesnt specify if its pre or post-book I was under the assumption that it was pre-book Guy and Vanessa are comfortably wealthy, not rich And if he marries me then he wont get found as corrupt so he wont lose his title :KEKW: Im already queen of this server, whats one more title?

Perfect Obviously, dont start spamming it :ninodrunk: Always Makes me feel isolated but theres a slither of hope left The orange and browns make it feel like a desert in the Saharan heat. Probably going to die if I dont make anything go right quick. The little bit of green symbolises the last hope and ambition of making it even if it seems ludicrous. A tree in the middle of a desert? Too good to be true. But if I dont reach out, Ill never know if I actually had a chance or not Perhaps all of the branches in front are like a cage or a prison- stopping you from reaching what you want :siwonwhat: Are you saying my portrayal is as good as Pris idk man :aaaaaaaaaaah: Beckett and Witness MC :ivySweat: Why couldnt I have been born in December for Mona, obviously Didnt it say its not due until 2023 or something No real point putting it on the calendar when its redundant Are my initials MS because I made Microsoft Whoa Isnt Chazz gay Yikes Just let me be October Val Ill take it Cant wait for someone with November to make the joke theyre now dating me :ninodrunk: Ew, Kiara I got freaking BARTIE Oh god I got Rheya Does that make me a vampire Or will she just kill me I hate my phone corrects kill to Jill Ive never eaten a Poptart If owning a dog is the same as pregnancy, then interviewing furries must be- COO: a pigeon romance Though, I think Hatoful Boyfriend already did that one Interesting That reminds me that I wrote a fan-fic on a friends cat who we joke is a drug lord I wrote it while I was on the bus :KEKW: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/811605665142276106/907193113435602944/ED891B28-ED22-447B-80C6-C7C491E0A718.jpg This is the photo that gave me the inspiration for the story Okay, dont embed, Discord. Thats fine Queen B is the best so shes an all-star and the chapter has a bunch of sex! So shes- shes- smash- Sonia and Maxwell, hm https://twitter.com/playchoices/status/1466491581226225675?s=21 As of an hour ago What are time zones Dont know her I havent got it :SadCat: Can you like actually send photos of the Insiders Its not in my inbox Zzzzzz I finally got it Oh my god, I forgot LOA was a thing This upsets me deeply Can you stop spoiling my Friday evening stop The thing is is the Olivia doesnt look that bad :IDKher: Okay I'm putting my foot down Stop with the Yass stuff please You're just spamming and these look awful It was fine when it was a couple but you guys are posting multiple every hour Please either reduce massively or stop Thank you :kyuok: Yeah, use that please So I can mute that You don't need to apologise I'm sorry for snapping a bit And I apologise if it seems like I've been targeting you lately; that's absolutely not the case Do people.. not know this? I literally greet 99% of people with you alright? No This one pains me because its true But do Americans really just go deadpan monotone bye? :corncomfaded: :wookblep: Even when Im doing the phone at work, I always go okay, byeeee! wHY IS THIS RELATABLE :yesungomg: Yes, Dr. Layhurs Ive met many a swan Since Ive basically lived close to rivers my entire life Encountered swans, even fed them And nothing has ever gone wrong But for whatever reason I will swear by my life they are aggressive bastards Same The things I do for you all Dang I remember some of the SPL1 ex-members and oh boy Worries me that they could be on Reddit too I still dont see how making male-only genderlocked books solves anything :kyusquint2: Wouldnt surprise me. Two sex books and an already controversial book I see so many Facebook comments saying they want male genderlocked books and theyre sick of female ones like

They try to say theyre doing it for equality but
Youre literally just reversing the problem? :kyusquint2: Just say youre not okay with it when it actually affects you :colorful_sparks: Pretty much I dont really care about being forced to be a guy in video games, and I havent really heard many girls feel that way either (though I know they exist) but Ive seen so many men get angry that they cant be a guy and are forced to be a girl Ill happily play Pokmon Red/Blue or Witcher and be forced to play a guy, I dont mind If I have the option to be a woman, I will be, but I genuinely dont think twice if I have to be a guy True but these men get soooo aggressive. They treat it like some sort of damaged masculinity attempt Point is is that I dont see why PB *should* make a male-lead book. Again, men are their minority. While I dont think its fine to female genderlock books when it isnt part of the story, I dont think making male-leads are the solution for equality :tikiga: I prefer pre-made LIs too I typically dont find myself attracted to GOC/choose look LIs That too Editing QB2 and I really feel like Kingsley is written so safely. Whereas Zoey is written freely and has a really bold personality Talking about male Sams breasts :monkaW: Is rather have forced LIs like Ethan (book 1) or Beckett than a GOC LI Problem is is that PB isnt really in a position to experiment Because if it doesnt work then theyre in a really bad spot Take ATV for instance Whats PBs parent company again? Nexus or some crap :siwonwhat: Basically this Theyve been saying for years that PB isnt making their dues Its hard to say I dont think were due another quarter review for a while? My main fear is how theyll work on sequels in future. Because VIP books tend to be standalone so its a little hard to say how theyll progress in future The whole VIP pre-release thing wouldve been good when PB was releasing their nine books a week thing. But when regular users are getting like two. Thats not good. I really dislike how PB managers their warnings They put warnings on the smallest things and not on the things that matter Like a gun appearing for two seconds really doesnt need a warning, in my view :siwonwhat: Hell, they dont put a warning on the fact ILB MC can literally lose a finger, and as far as Im aware they still havent, but oh my goodness, what if you date a teacher that youve been able to date since book one :kyuomg: Wasnt that in TE2 Or 1 :corncomfaded: It makes sense in TE for people to be upset since you select your sexuality at the start but like mmmmmmmmmmm Wasnt MCs friend in Platinum given the same treatment Shane or whatever his name was Probably I dont remember Lu is a lusbian? Listen, Lu, you got to remember that Im a cishet white girl. Yall are just very good friends in my eyes because Im very stupid :SadCat: :corncomfaded: I love Raleigh Male Raleigh He gave me guitar Husband I swear I made a list of every LI I romanced once Or was that the GOC/races Aahhh I will Make a list tomorrow Of every book But I need to sleep because it is almost 2AM The what ,im choices everett I dont Female white Everett is cute I like her ,im Choices Julian Im in pain Julian looks like a chad Like actual knobhead Female white Everett please Oh, is her name Yvette I know literally nothing about Slow Burn Ye-vet Anyway, I need sleep. Ill write that LI list for you tomorrow, Lu :corncomfaded: Goodnight Pinned a message. Do yall want to know who I had a weird obsession with a few years ago The Conductor from Hat in Time I was *obsessed* *him* Yes Like, that is how you write a memorable character And his voice actor replied to me on Twitter :shyduck: Yeah!! I was so excited At the time, I used one of the characters he voices in Fire Emblem Heroes a lot too So he liked my Innes :catblush: https://youtu.be/rSSFtha4zIE Anyway, heres a banger soundtrack I love it Its excellent Its definitely worth playing I didnt finish it myself because you do kind of need a controller (which mine is very broken) but I played most of it Should be both? But Conductor is like Extremely Scottish Its hilarious https://youtu.be/Xj-kIwc6yZk I wouldnt say this game is UK-based?  Just that Conductor has a very clear Scottish accent If its from QB, I have a slight feeling what it is And if its that Oh dear Anyway MLF deactivating My reaction: https://tenor.com/view/icarly-freddie-freddie-benson-yes-oh-gif-21382649 I know I add a little Edited by MaralinaSakura to mine but its literally at the top and I put an authors note so its easily missable I dont care about them Just MLF My darkest desire is to eat spaghetti at midnight My guess is that he wants to see a male-dominating role instead of female-dominating in a relationship A man lusting over a woman instead of the woman "tempting" a man I think its the same as Fantina in Pokmon She speaks broken French in English and broken English in French? > In the Japanese and French versions she speaks English, while in the Danish, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish versions she has a noticeable French accent.
> In the English dub of the anime, she also spoke with a French accent. In all honesty It's not that bad of an ad? It looks like that one Ethan picture I dont care about Insiders now VIP-locking is a thing How can I be excited for something thats, at minimum, two months away Zzzzzz PB using the other definition of Wild West :kyusquint: Oh my god, I hate that Dreame company They keep making these ads with stolen NSFW artworks Keeps coming up on my feed and I report it every time I've reported like at least eight of them and got them taken down It's because they keep making new accounts and never the default one :nicowoke: Why has thoust summoned thee Hello Oh yes, I love this GIF https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU5ejL8KWo0 This is like the rare time we see "Snape" smiling and laughing and it hits me Five Yes :E_QiqiPathetic: My god, when my manager asks me to tally up how much money weve made today Its an absolute nightmare if we have a lot of iPad sales There is for the sales done by the till But if its done through the iPad (because its something weve ordered for someone) then I have to manually tally it from the printed receipts I get paid tomorrow :HandsUp: I was never losing my Nitro I just went back to Classic Wait, we went back to boost level 1 I'm just confused We had ten boosts Pri had two, I had one We somehow lost four You not going to say how? :KEKW: Ehooo Wordle 223 5/6





 It changed to Thursdays a few months ago But you can ask for a wang without having to show that you're sharing illegal assets I doubt it They probably know the game is dying and they probably won't do anything to stop leakers But even MLF doesn't care about Choices much anymore I think she mostly posts about RC now :sungminjudge: I impulse uhhhhhh :kanginstress: I havent really impulse bought anything in a while I used to impulse buy a lot of merch But then I ran out of merch to impulse buy That reminds me that Raycon finally approved to send me a new pair Since my current ones were faulty after less than a month of use :haewelp: I thought Android let you change your app icon anyway iOS doesn't let you, what :kyusquint2: Piss off, no way Whore :nicothinking: I wasn't going to, I am far too lazy to do so Drew???? I've been iOS my entire life??? YES I use Bluestacks to play Choices, you numpty We sure are, babe Its just strange how kid-friendly PB used to be and now its all sex and smut Nah, I mean more the shift focus This is somehow the same company that gave us TC&TF, HSS, TF, etc and now gives us Surrender, TNA, etc Nah, course not What I mean is I lost my train of thought God My friend and I just spent the last four hours reading through Arc 2 of my fic All 36k words she read aloud And my writing made her cry :gorbedo: *sigh* Just why? Wordle 261 3/6



 ^ six tries So freaking rude (Wordle) My end result looks like a duck Yuck, Colt Let me change Deal 175 new messages since I went for a nap :keksweat: Im sure whatever went on, Lu is the best bitch No u :catblush: Omg please Ill cuddle him all day DILF cant believe someone actually commissioned that Surprisingly? Ive never commissioned artwork of Snape Ive only commissioned the OCs of my fic I've seen so many people call Snape abusive to Lily and I'm just like :gorbedo: He literally. left her peacefully alone after she wouldn't accept his apology? How is that abusive I wouldn't even say he was abusive to students either because if you actually *bother* to read, he cares a lot about the students. He shouldn't hit them but he was far from the only teacher who had a sharp tongue. Just look at Pince and Filch, for Christ sake Snape literally saves Harry's life in the first book of his own volition And he actively calls Dumbledore out for raising Harry for slaughter He cares about Harry but he can't show it because he's a double agent Death Eater and of course you'd not feel great having to protect your crush's son Depends on the canon. But honestly, can you blame him? He was literally 21 at the time it happened, in extreme distress because he knew *he* was about to get them all killed. He was naive, scared, etc. You can't pin something on someone they said in extreme distress over eleven years ago He probably just misspoke if anything Hermione Turns out I misread this but let me clarify something:
Snape pleads with Voldemort to save them all *and* Voldemort agrees but says that if any of them stand in his way, he will kill them.
He pleads with Dumbledore to save just Lily (though this is changed to all of them in the film, probably because the Voldemort scene is omitted) because he knew saving James wasn't possible because, knowing James, he would do anything to protect his family and fight Why even bother talking about things as if it's a generation thing when it basically almost always means nothing People can't even decide what generation my year is so why does it matter According to some websites, I'm Gen Z. To others, I'm a Millennial. No matter what I am, I know I'm problematic either way :Dabshe: You're Lu That basically sums it up I still remember my first brick phone. A 10 Virgin pink phone from Tesco Couldn't even access the internet on it Do I still own it? Yes. For sentimental purposes? Oh no. It's because my mum is crazy and thinks we need to save every single phone I owned "in case of an emergency" So now I have like three old phones on zero battery that probably don't work anymore "in case" my iPhone 11 that I take amazing care of somehow explodes Why am I such a toddler compared to everyone here :gorbedo: So a year Yep I've had my iPhone 11 for... two... three years? And it's really starting to slug now at times Yep, I still have my iPhone 6 Tossed it in a drawer somewhere Can't wait for zombies to take over the Earth and Blackberries become the world's new currency Lu bites zombies The fLu https://tenor.com/view/starkid-rage-im-in-a-rage-gif-5865719 The heck happened :KEK: I want beef omg yes Oop Oh my god, it gets worse Omega yikes I havent continued playing SR for a few weeks now but it was enjoyable while I did play it I can definitely see why it isnt for some people but the writers did a good job of making those who are vanilla or ace feel able to relate and understand in some ways I just woke up from a dream where Snape and I went to France But then I also became a hitman who had to kill the Queen and I was a terrible hitman Yes, these are both the same dream One :catblush: Bitch ass, we didn't go all the way to France for him to sleep on the floor Duh :PAUSERS: TIME TO MAKE MY SNAPE FIC IN IT They are not the same skin tone shading https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/u0td1o/a_probably_innacurate_count_of_who_has_more/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf They made a whole post now BB3 was pretty atrocious We went from cool vampires to smut ...Sums up Choices in a nutshell, to be honest Yassified Adrian, I guess :ch_shrugs: Gaiboo Awuwstwine Share it :blurryeyes: Would you save for a smut scene? Put that finger down then I got four fingers left :agony: I would need to see a list but I'm sure I changed LIs in at least one book I guess I dumped Thomas for Levi And Mal for Tyril I was a Kaitlyn dater but oh my god, she became insufferable after some point I never actually finished the series, now I think of it I quit partway through whatever the second series was called The.. Junior? "I want to be in a band but the other girls are being mean to me :REEEEE: " Why. Dan and Tobias And Julien I love him and his label on his leg I- :aivySweat: .img Kaneko jesus I just noticed his hair is dip dyed?

:SClongcat2: 
:SClongcat1: IT'S INDIRECTLY BECAUSE OF YOU It was a joke And then you made it I dont see the problem with Beckett His eyes just arent as sharp Otherwise, looks the same to me https://tenor.com/view/lucius-malfoy-how-dare-you-a-very-potter-musical-gif-5053582 What's ID Desire thingy Done Thank you, hun :BOOBA: https://tenor.com/view/avpm-starkid-voldemort-tease-gif-25145430 Oop No I think youll find that I can but your lifestyle choices do the deed for me :pepepoint: Most Wanted and Wake the Dead I would assume that Most Wanted would be Sam and uh The other dude Dave? It's two for the price of one :ch_shrugs: https://www.reddit.com/r/merlinbbc/comments/wu904f/things_i_noticed_as_a_merlin_fan_while_playing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf Me rewatching Merlin again as an adult and watching it when it released as a kid, of course I noticed these :KEK: MUMMY :nicowoke: They arent banned but their posts wont come up anymore unless you search for their profile I suppose mine would be (in no order)

Bitch?
Gaius is the hottest, sexiest man I have ever met Ill give him more than a kiss But for the sake of keeping this SFW, my answer *definitely* meant two kisses He's over 2720 years, according to the Wiki And we have a rough time frame of the uh, o h my god, how do I English Like the era When he was turne But I guess that doesn't really help He looks like he's in his 30s-40s to me Like early 40s at *worst*
