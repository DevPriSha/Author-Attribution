I see :0 hello @Deleted User welcome!!! I keep forgetting about that upcoming book HSKSHDKSH and then you kiss her HSKSHDKDH it is illogical but I suppose that's PB's définition of hate love relationships and you know, I seriously suspect Poppy will become a full LI in Book 2, there are too many hints many wouldn't mind, Poppy still has a lot of fans, they're part of the silent majority I like Nia too she's very sweet bitchy like Poppy or sweet like Nia, there's the dilemma xDD but one thing is for sure, I'm tired of the professor I hope they add more LIs https://potionsprefect.tumblr.com/post/643029948405268480/chapter-one https://jamespotterthefirst.tumblr.com/post/643029613057114112/i-fail-to-see-pbs-reasoning-behind-making https://jamespotterthefirst.tumblr.com/post/643028174062616576/love-harper-but-what-the-hell-pb-this-doesnt-make https://bryceslahela.tumblr.com/post/643052451024535552/oph-spoilers-okay-i-am-torn-between-laughing-my no idea maybe from insta or there are other people on tumblr who access scripts as well https://jamespotterthefirst.tumblr.com/post/643030549913616384/can-i-ask-if-flirts-with-and-how https://jamespotterthefirst.tumblr.com/post/643032169046016000/answering-anons-under-the-read-more-thank-you https://brooks-eden.tumblr.com/post/643033235136348160/me-im-going-to-try-and-stay-away-from-spoilers the jealous one HSKSHDKSHD https://brooks-eden.tumblr.com/post/643042698440343552/imma-be-honest-the-thought-of-and they say MC will have a monologue of jealousy I hope it's only for Ethan romancers my MC has no reason to get jealous https://queenofboops.tumblr.com/post/643071921808867328/i-just-got-back-from-answering-my-homeworks-and HSKSHDKSHD sorry but yeah there's so much negativity on tumblr https://katkart122.tumblr.com/post/643194065926635520/open-heart-spoilers-ahead okay HSKSHDKSHD the book hasn't even been released yet and they're already ranting that's very cool I only hope they calm down when they release the book because they already sent anon hate to my friend all day yeah she just said the truth, she didn't deserve such hate but happily the whole fandom is supporting her HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA this is so funny and where's the lie? xDD the worst thing is Ethan wouldn't put up with a partner like that is it gone again? no idea what happened but don't worry, it will reborn yeah I confirm, it's still there maybe her country is still in lockdown, some countries have recently entered in lockdown again but who knows, just speculating does anyone know where to find this background please? does it appear in other books or only in OH? THANK YOU!!! for the ones who have read Platinum: can you guys please give me some ideas about what Raleigh and DS Edward would do if they met? :nowords: sorry, I edited it this that sucks, it's like they want to force us to interact to keep appearances the fact that they're your relatives shouldn't mean you have to put up with them despite them being a pain in the ass, mental peace goes first
