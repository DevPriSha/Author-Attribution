in a country doing much better like one nurse here broke a stay-home notice to buy bubble tea and has been jailed for seven weeks when you're on stay-home notice here you're technically in isolation so like no ordering unless you want to heft a hazard bill yes lol you can always plant a person from this server as an employee in PB (since they're almost always hiring) then leak their meeting links why there's now a strict enforcement thing for racket sports whereby you have a tag for the hour you are at your court and you can't come and go ||nasha is just general intoxicating substances right|| Speed Simply intoxication It's a love thing so Looking at the episode channel i'm reminded of the time i tried tkl but could not because Riley eerily resembled one of my lit teachers back in the day What if we see Ezekiel though For a sec I thought it was The Purge sideline but i'm writing a research proposal and hit enter from the references page to get the hyperlink and google docs assumed i wanted to continue typing in blue underlined text never happened before kinda funny ah yes, India light disappearance moments there was a storm once back in 2011 (i still lived in india then) and it was in noida in july and lasted from 6pm to something something am ig i was 8 at the time then we tried sleeping in 37C with no fan or AC ::D apparently it's better now i hope it went well! .......L nice I am simultaneously frightened and intrigued by this family tree thing i think we summarised mtfl in those two messages Perhaps when you say a rather troubling statement, like 
"shoku, ||I feel like cutting myself||" (I have expressed this sentiment to a book before)
then it asks "would you like some calming music?" or something perhaps the thing can let you choose who you would like to consult most with in dire straits so it knows which certain people to call and whether or not to call them perhaps it could have the power to create a hug environment idk i'm just throwing stuff out Like warmth if the ac is running, then some sort of nature sounds or emotional support track "I'm so sorry"
"It'll be better soon"
"You'll get through this" It honestly just gets artificial like yes I things change but you don't need to express remorse for sth you had no hand in/try to reassure me by predicting the future Actually yes No cap but people do better when they sit close and say nothing than when they say a generic sympathetic line Fair enough. Side note: I guess you could also programme it to encourage the user to seek human help in case of ||over-attachment and withdrawal|| if possible Or any non-shoku spt Here are a few feel-good books you can add as shoku suggestions for non-human non-shoku spt:
The One and Only Ivan
Eliza and her monsters
i before e (except after c) it's a quasi-satirical take on a pronunciation guidebook iirc The first two resolve in the end they're a bit of a rollercoaster Also maybe better speech recog than current chatbots/ok Google/siri/alexa so if i'm like choked up w emotion or crying shoku can still mostly understand Also literally every Enid Blyton book is good for feel-good vibes Or just, very baseliney, straight up comics Wow that's cool i dabbled in programming for a while but gave it up to pursue my humanities better so programming is an enigma of sorts to me so I really appreciate all the work you're putting in Another sidenote: my sister did a telehealth project a few years back where she together with a team designed an app interface for seniors to have access to quality healthcare over videocall so ig Shoku could have some registered therapists/psychiatrists if you want to book a zoom with them Right, that does make sense. I suppose then it could encourage you to look for qualified therapists near you or so Does every country have a centralised Mental Health Institution? Because here in Singapore there is one, and also the network of sometimes substandard Education Ministry school counsellors (our MOE doesn't care), but the IMH is q good This is just in relation to therapy needs Interesting Iirc china set up a separate helpline when covid broke out for support I assume these are all in fahrenheit then it's apparently 90 F here although it kinda feels like 75-80 i mean it is raining top tip for humid environments: deal w it there's nothing you can do just swim through the caribbean :thumb: ah shit the only cruise I've been on is a 45 min "cruise" from sg to bintan island indonesia I'd be interested to know what it's like to suck a geography the only upside of that "cruise" was the snack station Hdy teach a map incorrectly I gave an equally chaotic answer for that ::) "even chopped liver has its uses" ~some MC Division of india by stereotypes There were many countries but i understood this one most Hmm perhaps I should don hats Nice server nickname Also where did the a go lol I mean Jadebot is somehow better than Dadbot Minecraft? inspired by ||the entire OH coffee machine thing||, I did a starbucks quiz to 'find my coffee' according to my answers I like things "dark, bold and adventurous" sounds simultaneously like innuendo and a really long research report :MunchlaxMunch: That'd explain the long neck divineck I turned on live captions once and since my teacher spoke in non-US english way all the words came out weird HAH google just told me tomorrow's weather report "30C tomorrow, 4 colder than today" I love how they called it colder and not like cooler (for F ppl, it's 77F tmr) that was unexpected Ugh I'm so embarassed earlier today I was on a train in peak hour and I opened AME and forgot that my phone was on full volume and it was the loud theme and everyone turned to stare in my direction not putting this in #let-it-go because not very significan heh my then-classmates are reminiscing about the time one person cheated the word count system by putting in white underscores before submitting as pdf and hardcopy (since both are required) so as to reduce word count still does another person did it recently and the best part is most of the teachers are young enough to know these tricks /:) F but handwritten counting words is stupid it's like either count every individual word or (lines x words per line) i find both perfectly fine but we consider it weird that we always have to cut words while people on certain sections of the internet (not here) are like omg i can't even reach the min word count time to put words in white same but unfortunately a lot of my teachers did too we had both final year was "in future you need to be concise because internet arguments and essay time limits so we'll restrict the number of words" but we always got them to push it so never i'm delaying further education as much as possible because sg only recently announced that we're finally getting an arts uni so i'm pausing everything until 2023/4 so i'll probably have to do other things I've been looking around instagram and apparently WIRED is doing this article/vid on Choices and its fandom no link wait a sec ok bad grammar and hated acc but well ||        || she's the emoji and poor grammar and exclamation marks person empty space that's true too let's see but then she doesn't bother about the rules too much either lol i just got an ad on yt from an insurance company on cheap car maintenance tips the only tip was: foggy headlights?

it was simple, direct, and effective in communicating its message although the solution was oversimplified it presents an ideal world-ish scenario i just noticed the discord at top left what the hell I agree with the group name are you watching patiala house by any chance hhhh In any case according to their job postings pb is working on another game (segue from #books-not-yet-released) I the company profit is not the app profit it's after everything payments wise has been done Including like the 30% to google and apple And taxation Not including salary because I'm not 100% sure about how that's done Net of a million a month isn't enough to sustain a company with a wildly popular app They're not a big company which take up most the space in an industry that they can just do something radically different to increase profits and not see players go ta-ta Making do isn't exactly sustainable in the long run It's just waiting to collapse Admittedly not but it's worth noting that episode's model is different from choices, and so is rc in the sense that they release a lot of chapters at once Also episode has over a hundred million downloads on google play and choices has over ten million And i think after the player-proclaimed golden era of choices there's already a very high benchmark for each new book to meet Wrt chapters they have a pretty stable player base of people into romance cliches Whereas choices' player demographics are more complex Nexon prioritises its games which it knows can constantly deliver which means their focus is on asia Nexon's acquisition saved PB Because if you look back in their blog when they were starting out with choices they had a bunch of pay cuts and other financial issues And now pandemic times has made things stressful for individual employees too That's a consequence of reduced income Low income > cannot pay salaries > lay off Also top of the game doesn't mean they have a lot of money Popularity doesn't always equal to revenue But the question is is it enough Those romance books (imo) are a response to every other visible social media post being about going gaga over a love interest, and the fact that these inexpensive books which appeal to fb moms with more spending power than millennials and gen z gives them funds for their bigger goc fantasy etc etc projects And many of the players who migrate from choices because too much romance migrate to chapters and romance club which is quite the mixed set of signals Also i'm fairly sure that due to the high concentration of companies big and small alike mountain view office space costs a lot (any cali ppl can correct me if i'm wrong pls) And America isn't exactly fair to smaller companies Again choices has a player base with contradictory demands. Just as the people into more diverse genres complain about romance books, how many fb moms dyt played books like tctf, mw, hss, etc vs this same demographic playing like roe, etc (in terms of older books) Blades was the reckoning book imo: if it didn't do well they'd have just shut everything down Because it was so damn expensive like  so many portraits, 20 tracks in a single book, an XP system, so many variables Yes hss also had many variables but that was manageable due to the fact that they released 16 chapters at once (which they had been planning from long back anw) And there isn't a backlog of books to release either like up till 2018 they were just releasing books which had been roadmapped, some even before choices' release Like even OH was concepted before choices' release K fair enough They made 16 new MCs for one book There are departments for everything Blades :kek: It's not like the books with reused faces reused everything else right Ok but not _everything_ else right Even reusing costs money in terms of ppl who go ew same face And depart without bother for the content of the book They are a new game with a widely expanding player base and honestly the same issues as PB You can't just say X is similar to Y. X does this, therefore Y should also be able to do this Choices is 5, and PB is even older And honestly RC is just poaching players like so many free diamond choice events and a literal promotion saying if you migrate over to us and email us about it we'll match your diamond balance from your previous _choices game_ in romance club Although they meant visual novel games at large their intent is cleaf Choices has the most players hence poachy poachy A lot of choices players have turned to exclusively playing RC (and these very players go ew romance) Ok i suppose that's fair enough lmao america american way to eliminate drink driving you can drive at 14 1/2 but can only drink from 21  so basically TFS I think they went into tumblr a couple hours after the announcement Only for this year apparently If it's any consolation at least PB isn't pulling any really shitty corporate moves like uh Nestl and Amazon I mean they're too small to do so and get away with it ig Best case scenario they suspend VIP altogether Yee never thought i'd see a jacked-up pencil speaking of writing my handwriting has been blasted and bombasted more than a losing player is in smash an old sample ik it isn't that bad this is one of my friends' medical shorthanddd shorthand do be like that what did nando's put in their chicken burgers before?? duck? i always remove the lettuce from my burgers lettuce is wack in general anyway i eat most vegetables anyway like the full range of em Just tried it
Eh omg i remember that if we wrote "things" we'd get judgemental circles and question marks neat handwriting tho which reminds me in an internal exam paper review in this same test i wrote "views" such that the only possible way to read it  was "rims" so the sentence went "whose rims aligned with theirs" :wut: thanks reddit Everyone i know who got the free three month nitro anxious about it ending in a few days: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

- LPG price increases the sheer variation in these articles also i was like "ok what's ndtv's website i've never been there" and i typed .in to see hindi and i don't know what i was expecting i mean i can read the page but it's still funny i swear all the entertainment articles are just like (translating here) "salman khan is not getting the bigg boss house, is wandering in the jungle as such- watch" and then you have a very serious article discussing Taliban takeover's possible effects on Kashmir geopolitics just above it ik but it's funny because ndtv is always like "yes we are the one true non-tabloid news source in india, source: us" tbh even here all the sponsored content is wack asf well. ok yeah this is trashy second major newssite's sponsored content is 50-50 oh my god why did i try it i need more eyebleach than when I read someone write Straits as Straight scroll down why do y'all have labour day on a different day from the rest of the world very epic wts i ran choices on my computer for like 10 min on battery and it dropped from 100% to 80% lovely i even put it on best battery life grrrr i actually don't remember 2018? :Dopeysad: _trigooo_ ~~revolt~~ what would an accountant revolution look like i wonder also my laptop before noon :KEKWhands: **hmm i wonder what would happen if i a c c i d e n t a l l y pressed G6* G7 instead of F6*G7** https://soundcloud.com/cleancutsmusic/sets/rom-com-game-music all these tracks seem to be intended for different choices games but there are like 5 unused I, on the other hand, am glad to see my creation being used for chaotic good on a related note, if a Corgi had only had one functioning eye and wore an eyepatch over the other, could it be called a Carrrrgi? because Pirates, arrr, and yeah you might want to specify which gabriel :kek: :kek: :niapanic: oh dear Ah yes, the ultra-wealthy disgusting people i would but then i'd get all manner of chronic diseases rumour has it that he has multiple rooms/floors for his dog(s) i don't know how much my plan costs because i live w my parents and they manage it i am so screwed when i move out (in like 10-15 years because realistically no single person can get apartments before 35) lmao nitro I love my phone making emotes blursed Not this one though. The frog one, yes. Spot the funky emotes I actl love that they're like that tho Dark mode maybe Yep my system dark mode messes some stuff up But without it its like discord  light mode everywhere It's 1am i'm trying (and failing) to sleep i don't need that in my mind's eye tqvm .. Thanks friend time Now you see, these. these are the ads i like. This person is I was going to make a comparative statement but honestly They either have no shame or they just play one story my older sister said once her classmate got maggi to school and her friends were all excited than it turned out to have milk i don't like maggi but

- generally reliable frequency
- generally reliable to not break down maybe
- quick and easy
- lots of bus stops i feel sad whenever i read and reread the development of that it's only a trillion + dollars meanwhile bus stops they'll hide their money on an artificial island in some ocean then claim it to be part of a tax haven country but like literally all of sg is suburbia except the city centre japan's metro is literaly painful and yet impressive to look at the map ~~also not to flex or anything but all the trains are electric and air-conditioned here and probably also in japan~~ one final sg flex and then i'll stop but yes japan is very cool id like to go but covid covid covid and idh an sg passport to go visa-free ~~go by boat~~ and the friends we make along the way when were you last here ooh it's bettered by quite a bit since then although construction is slow because covid and we don't like to treat transient workers properly ok so this was it in 2016 this is what is ultimately planned to be (by 2040?) but as fn it's this :pixelbartie: same channel this guy compares a bike ride from city centre to hardware store in Amsterdam (Netherlands) vs in Calgary (Canada) plus one for safe or good minus two for unsafe or ungood final results (Amsterdam P1, Calgary P2) both started from 0 this was the Amsterdam guy's score seeing the Calgary's guy score now (since they both have different biases) Calgary guy that's a nice account name just as we were spamming to get uber to show these also OP replied to themselves and still got 6 points very epic moment he was not the most pleasing to the eyes Did you just change tata to metta Ratan Metta Oh dear TRR Who failed to show in any chapter after the Bastien revelation (right?) throwback to 2020 assignments ah yes lovely ad alignment i cannot stand anymore of rohit shetty's cop thrillers (after singham like 2) i n d i a n b a r b i e nice one yes time to look it up on private mode it's the same audio as the original version literally they just mixed up the choreography it's honestly not bad it's the same no re-sing no remix just new video i didn't bother with the comments what i didn't see any such comments they're just praising the performance and the fact that they didn't destroy the song with computerised version of a new singer's voice which one are you looking at oh bruh uh uh yeah same laughs in indoor weddings still #23 on trending also what's w the abandoned carnival but it's nice just two ppl having fun Wtf For who from who I'm guesing for her from him Cos that's how hindi films work Dude, dudettes, and doodlejumps!

Take your kuhnfusion somewhere else It's ok  is a wonderful (painful to play) piece I am not entirely sure that that is how it works You're playing romance club? Wow Heaven's secret naughty boy? Damn ok Chapter 1: the hiatus is in two weeks' time lmao there are still chapters before that plus wtd is coming back this month for vip the comments on the post are very toxic though I feel like these would be the people who complain about the plane being delayed because there is a problem with one of its parts Source: been there, had my ears bleed with their high-pitched complaints there was something wrong with the landing gear, in this case it appears that they watched krrish 3 one too many times and expected him to save them @Priyudi @Akuna Matata You have been charged with moving one number in the accounts you changed the amount from $910,232,560 to $10,232,569 but like you took all of it and spent it on VIP :panik: how did this go from mercury thermometers to whatever this is c for careful
c for concise
c for chaos I agree, Celsius supremacy it is then the ping was for krrish 3 lmao Metta are you afraid of jail Metta the Jailer is scary ,img krrish 3 funny airplane epic cgi who controls the Maxwell tupper quick and her ellipses dw no one does ,img chaos ok not that anything but that ok finally a non-covid result that is the objective of cartoon filters yes A lot of the times people forget that Pixelberry is still an SME not a large company and most if not all changes and developments in society affect them a lot And I'm willing to bet they sub to at least two streaming services "Even Netflix is cheaper" yes Netflix is a huge-ass corporation not a hundred people being forced to work from home for two years Oliver Miao being Rowan West is very concerning Furthermore, one of PB's current priorities seems to be making the app more accessible by expanding it to more languages (ES, DE, FR) and it then also has the potential to aid people in language learning. And based off the files available and their intent to translate full series, I calculated the chapters in a foreign language by the time they are done with these three languages for the current series being translated (DD, RCD, BB, TRR) and the number comes to 882 (i.e. 294 per language) For context, the current number of English language chapter descriptions is 1703 Plus, staff teams overlap for each book, be it for art, writing, or QA testing (that I think is a common team which just makes the burden more) Honestly I would just ask these people to touch some grass and realise that the world doesn't revolve around them, but the social media algorithms are also to blame because they push negative content up and people are tied to these not-so-nice ideas and worldviews Dear lord the comments are all "remember time XXX" and "omg i'm unsubbing" and "you had *better* apologise" what are you, the internet mafia? https://tenor.com/view/touching-grass-touch-gif-21219969 Ok are people stupid? Like, actually are you stupid? oh dw there were comments about that as well and how they should give the VIP players those cancelled sequels as the gift also like Choices isn't there life, but to the employees it is do you think they'd cancel sequels for fun life as in livelihood it looks worse on computer dw A platypus? *Drew* the platypus?? which reminds me insiders in under 24h what are the vibes tbh i feel like the fandom can't be pleased
- the MCs are too goody-two-shoes but i don't like the non goody-two-shoes MCs

a) the rest of the series doesn't live up to the extremely high/unique expectations of the players and they go about complaining about it on tumblr until time ends
b) the rest of the series overshadows the first book and the first book becomes treated like a preface or a prologue while it's actually really not also note that staff overlap for a lot of books, so asking for a sequel for A is basically delaying a sequel for B in some ways demand is way higher than when choices started out, and so is competition Always have been yes i play in an orchestra very frequently why do you ask Why would the composer determine whether you get first chair Imagine Imagine tax shit not being auto-processed in your country but it's in florida Good evening from here Well, night How's it going in the sunshine state ~~is it the heat or the humidity~~ .w miami That's not too bad Wait no wrong place Time to search random city in Florida Ok yeah that's even better Lol Maybe i'm just used to it Annelyse.

Liam yeah, especially since the elves are the slimmest fit male bodies aww I'm honoured for female? lemme checl no no nope neither are those for both m and f student arms are firmly by the side elf is careening into the leg aw damn i really want my male elf mc's hair this was me months ago juxtaposing adventurer outfit w/o adjustments on adventurer and journalist and well oh shit it's tif there we go journalist has this more stuck-out kind neck i think it appears when it comes to help you in ILB ok just assembled one ah shit oh apparently angy otter doesn't show up .img choices angry otter AHAHAHAHA is it just me who finds the caucasian tf mc face creepy I quite liked that sprite variation Looks so cute But that means that they can release a book with 3 new MC faces + 1 old face and student body (because RT, TRM, and this) I tried to put the face into different student outfits and well i messed up quite a bit including the fact that skin colour doesn't match I'll x-post to #deleted-channel Creepy stalker? ~~Skip~~ interesting the second woman's laugh is so creepy in the first ad was looking through the 8emi95 drive again apparently spanish rcd is to be ||Diarios De Hollywood|| i mean idk whether to mark spoiler but here ye it's the breakroom where Eos and Zekei play Super Mario Space Laser version Qb Alright based on my opinion on the chief antagonist in each book, this is the break down by percentage this doesn't account for all books just for the ones I personally see a chief antagonist, i.e. who opposes the protagonist's aspiration (nearly) every step of the way "O" stands for Organisation So ppl like Ayna and Renza aren't counted *I counted Damon for TRM Because he's the primary influence dyt they'll release these simultaneously literally same family line Also angry otter Unfortunately bubblegum is a videogame character within a videogame scott is a character of off-tangent, i hate it how people say certain book(s) *deserve(s)* something what are you measuring its desert against that...isn't exactly objective I mean in a premium scene witness mc did talk about her parents iirc I didn't take it and i've yet to do a diamond playthrough Bsc i think one parent texted once That neck stretch though I'm sorry what was that Ad they have an interesting new twitter banner ~~I'm the choices logo because it gets to sit on Kamilah's shoulder~~ she's prepping the fireball either that, or this is Kung Fu Panda 3 who's the TUH LI on the banner though KFP3 then Two? The cover BB MCs are all hispanic (i think from trailer) Idts Well he does have the Cassius/Ethan body And an American Dream, apparently cwinge bad grammar plot twist: she is The Endless she sounds like a 3yo literally the BaBu babies ugh "a burning water" 70's Jax *pulls off rubberband securing ponytail* Mainly because most hairstyles have a front piece and a back piece to make it look natural. The back piece is always the lowest layer, i. e. everything else is above it and front piece is topmost layer.

In reference to how they phrased the blades part Anw will definitely need to stay away from all fandom sites until this blows over Good thing I removed reddit from my phone then Oho Nanny Affair Book 2 Part 2 :niapanic: Ok so, fae magick'd COVID vaccine but cowboy ditches it in favour of ivermectin and goes on a killing spree? Maybe it's going to be like that one Barbie movie i can't remember the title but the key song was "I Wish I Had Her Life" but this is swap of princesses ***146 comments*** of course. also cause they know that people will play finish blades and uninstall esp those who read like ten books in the library and make unwarranted judgements on the rest they should learn spanish and do the spanish version then omg tatsu why i had the most insane idea what if princess swap is another montjoy story before you judge me i thought of it while eating a cup cake like a cake in a cup not a mini muffin Pri: Bots are little babies also Pri in #bots-and-pets-uwu to Tatsu : Stfu but swearing at babies :judgeyfroge: why is she still wearing the tna1 fit i do hope it's not a petty squabble lmao i just saw an ig post assuming that blades had been delayed for the princess swap do these people not know how every book has a different team and andrew is working on crimes of passion, and most likely not the princess swap also PB's other project thing _this game has d r a m a_ MLF spoiling something after it got released   Knowing Americans they probably do sth like "bye gurll" or whatever or, if choices books are anything to go by, "I'll call you back <something annoying> just turned up" I think it's also because it goes with the general style of speaking goes for many pronunciations Because you once pinged a swan on discord, it broke your arm, and you have been averse to pings since I don't have a phd just yet we have swan statues and otters peep https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7f6s2g8C0I the full bbc feature there was also an otter gang fight how to start an otter gang fight yay snow? sure https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIeA7gzuiG0I6w19o7BjDBrHRp6gXMTvw get the crismis songs playing to make it snow faster im pretty sure that's the only 2019 holiday special which *didn't* have a theme makes sense tho the other three have a lot of tracks in general while BB has like ... 3 and uses the nb music dump from book 2 onwards oh god fnf was everywhere in book 1 idt anyone really steals BB soundtracks they're all very theme-oriented BB be like i have the chapters, you have the music, let's make a powerful 52 chapter series Beat dropped harder than Rheya's heart dropping when she realised she ||murdered Iola|| the fuck kinda trivia is that like i get it's to contribute to her thinking kane is (and i loathe to use this word) sussy but like also according to TE the Power is magickal I think they thought they complicated the TE + IL lore too much and were like yeah nah mate we're ditching this :kek: i have two very different mbti results i posit that mbti is a scam my heart will go on then plus it's a scale and like wow how the hell sew a santa fit and get it turned into well that absolutely diabolical burger king staff walkouts led to unused paper crowns which book is that achievement from is it ilb also 155 hrs in r/Choices how wut ah _ah_ I think i know why And the why is because she posted a major major spoiler which needs TWs without any cover I think it was a cg? Sth from qb iirc From what i know she curbed access to her dialogues folders too Which were also brazenly watermarked She does have one of her ig best bros spoiling everything possible i.e. The guy who posted the image bel covered up here Fair enough Cheers to that holy shit i didn't even realise It's called MENA and Africa (excluding MENA), mods sigrid wait why does the r/choices survey not allow me to choose both if i've played with both m and f type mc y'all celebrated a bit too early that's this guy to? ah https://www.instagram.com/ryusei_fjunryu/ he calls him*self* underrated yaaaa. https://www.reddit.com/r/Choices/comments/repcf7/iiiii_just_created_a_quiz_is_it_amazing_no_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I'm proud of this, really i saw duke my mind went to richards apparently not sorry mara Jolly Ol' St. Ramsey quite but not quite "The LI you get is your soulmate" Ah shit bad "never played this book" the rarest choices player fair The MC drama begins thank you bel i heard the audio tho idk if the villain edition was sent here but for good measure tw:rapidly moving images I can take dick it's transparent in the files tho or this v3 with the achievement banner ok nvm found it weeee i forgot to add multiple Es DD has alr met TE anw what abt ethan with salt n pepper hair u gd frat sureeee wtf you made the cow sound like courtney i mean it sounds like something she'd say @FraternalGemini u good bro k made some adjustments did i accidently give you guys an early christmas present chocolate chip anyways it's apt considering my whatsapp profile photo for christmas is this meme THANK you drew he is the horny jail what abt Cal as in since the examples you gave posits that all snarky LIs should have chest hair do you also believe the reverse weeee body hair options moment what what what what what i mean for any update i'll have to uninstall and reinstall from andropalace  :deargodhelp: it goes away though like the current one right the very first UI though (which i never saw cos i installed in 2019) -- pretend that isn't there ok there we go that's good the Happily Ever After CG? ok i navigated to a video of it and i get what you mean https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvgJoEgjnFo&list=PLnS7IZ3wCQo5C54-8YEALdj4XjAtPjT8X&index=11 it's this one so basically BBMC memojis have a 50-50 chance of either being completely accurate or completely inaccurate what the fuck was ad no. 3 more twists than the actual LOA book which had a considerable number of twists anyways hype Until Feb can mean until and including ch 6 WR Or until and including ch 9 WR Min and max ah Honey that's not how any of this works yeah lah you think what :) Y'ALL FRENCH TRANSLATIONS for these three BB ...and TRR which is now just RR i have no clue true .img my rcd covers yeah i made this post when they changed it the PTSD is real looks like a nickelodeon series cover this was before TRR was translated to Spanish i think the loading screens are the same yeah for English the loading screen is the same, for Spanish and French no true ~~non-Latin languages when?~~ i wonder how they'll pull it of for TRR tho cos a choice is how best to respond to Kiara in french, and. :niapanic: blursed alignment just do r00d :D D:* Omg it's basically the same ad but high The eye fire tho Also i like how MnM just appeared and disappeared Where did they go?

It's usually one or two emotions dominate a book nowadays like in the case of QB it's mostly angry and happy Sad if they're gaslighting/emo Deadpan RC with 16 emotions (making for very strange assets) Pissed
Miffed 
Slightly angry
Angry
Enraged But the RC love scenes screenshots are..... Arguably MM had a fair bit of jumping Has SW was a step with the drowning When characters are tired i see eyebags on them for some reason BB blood BB light Edward's tied up sprite was so funny tho .img Edward tied up Yeeeep Practice for the nights after with MC LMAO BEL SAME MIND Anyways On the other side restricted emotes make you pay attention to the dialogue and other stuff since it does not distract Because the analysis we are doing now is very retrospective From hfth?
