I completely agree with you lol. When there are people coming over, I love to cook & sometimes help my Mom. But when I am alone or my parents are going out, I am too lazy to cook for myself. Me too lol However, I would love to make something for someone else. > Which is basically what we use as coffee
Yas. We drink tea most of the times as well. Yas. Me too. But then again, I am modded. Ja Yas Witness was better imo Because of Cassian Ikr That book is ü§Ø Good luck. You will need it. How does it feel like playing 5 minutes of utter trash & then waiting for a key for 3 hours? Yas MTFL is atleast 3-4 min max I thought they would do an AME spinoff called 'Game of Love' based on Piper's show. Lol Piper as a producer :ohgodohduck: > AME3 kind of ruined the trilogy for me
Ya > sorta but at least we got a wedding out of it
Which was very unrealistic & not required. But PB milk everything. So ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è :JoJoThink: üíØ Lol I had my initial doubts about Duffy so I can say that I saw that coming.

@kioverity Seriously? :hmm: :ohgodohduck: You are right Kio Yup Michael B. Jordan :dogekek: Again, I am sorry if I offended someone. I compared his eyebrows & his beard. It had nothing to do with his colour. > Also while I'm at it, that "meme" of comparing the dad from MTFL to an actual convicted sex offender was gross. You all need to be tactful
What meme? Oof Lmao Are they even trying to change a bit? :kek: If she left, there should have been a message in #üö™server-door ...Why? :wut: As in a Cheat Day? Oof What happened? Well, it's not dumb to cry over a fictional character at all. Are you doing engineering or bachelors? :huh: Why did you take that course? Oof Then what was your choice? I see So what did you want to do after school? Okay
So did you try to convince your parents that you wanted to take a drop year or maybe more? Ah Ah We both have very similar cases. 
But I am interested in my course. But moving away from your parents during this pandemic seems very unlikely. If it's affecting your mental health, I suggest that you speak to a teacher or a counsellor about it & ask them to convince your parents. We do, but only in 4-5 states. :OOF: We don't have snow, but draughts in our state every year. I love playing in the snow lol Oof :ohgodohduck: There is a movie named Contagion (2011) which made me think if the virus is man-made, did they take inspiration from this movie?
