If Chloe dies, everyone in the bay who deserves to live stays alive (well beside william ✊). And to be completely honest, not many people would care about her death. There's Joyce, William, and Max.

If Chloe lives, you screw over every good person who deserves to be alive (ex. Kate, Joyce, Alyssa, possibly Victoria) besides Chloe. This means there are a lot more people who are forced to have to undergo the grief of the loss of their friends/family/etcs lives. Also from reading the wiki, the way Max and Chloe act about what happened and Joyce's death seems to be very questionable. Honestly, they didn't seem to care. And they hardly even go to see David, who had a slight redemption arc and is the only connection left to Arcadia Bay (as far as I know) and the only connection to her mother. And yeah, as 2-d said, Chloe was a bit annoying in some parts lol.","","⬆️ (1)"

I can't believe that they thought that adding a cute puppy just to kill it off would be a good idea. I'd be more ok if they let Mushroom grow into an adult but killing a puppy is just BS! Makes me wish there was an option to not take the puppy and leave it at the store. At least we can imagine it going to a much safer home.

So plump and fat and sleek and well content,
So little with the affairs of others meddling,
So little meddled with? say, a collared dog,
And hard worked ox, and horse still harder worked,
And caged canary, why, uncribbed, unmaimed,
Unworked and of its will lord absolute,
The pigeon sole has free board and free quarters,
Till at its throat the knife, and pigeon pie
Must smoke ere noon upon the parson’s table;
Say, if ye can; I cannot, for the life o’ me;
But, whersoe’er I go, I find it so;
The pigeon of all things that walk or fly
Or swim or creep, the best cared-for and happiest;
Ornament ever fresh and ever fair
Of castle and of cottage, palace roof
And village street, alike, and stubble field,
And every eye and volute of the minster;
Philosopher’s and poet’s and my own
Envy and admiration, theme and riddle;
Emblem and hieroglyphic of the third
Integral unit of the Trinity;
Not even by pagan set to heavier task
Than draw the cart of Venus; since the deluge
Never once asked to carry in the bill,
And by the telegraph and penny-post
Released for ever from all charge of letters.""","",""

The show was on the bubble and its prospects didn’t look great before the decision Monday. From Season 1 to Season 2, “Manifest” dropped 46% in the demo and 39% overall. The Seasons 2 to 3 declines were 40% and 31%, respectively. From Season 1 to Season 3, “Manifest” lost 68% of its rating and 58% of its audience.""","",""
